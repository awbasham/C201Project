    "articleText": "photo by Carol Duff Visit the Only Village Inside the Grand Canyon by Michele Lent Hirsch/Smithsonian.com/November 2015 If you haven’t visited the village of Supai, there’s probably a good reason: The only town inside the Grand Canyon, it’s located deep inside a 3,000-foot-deep hole. The only way to get there is by hiking, riding an animal or taking a helicopter. In fact, it’s the most remote town in the lower 48 states—and it’s well worth the inconvenience. Because it’s so remote, it’s also the only place in the country that receives mail deliveries by mule. Two hundred and eight people lived in Supai Village in 2010, according to the U.S. Census, and all of them get their mail by “mule train”—a series of linked mules carrying packages and letters. Each parcel that makes it out of Supai has a special postmark—one that’s well known to backpackers, who often mail out (or mule out) their heavy packs via the postal service rather than drag them back up eight steep miles. Supai is part of the Havasupai Indian Reservation, and the place where the Havasupai population has lived for more than 1,000 years—though the tribe has had to fight to retain the use of their own land.

    "description": "…by Gordon Duff, Senior Editor and Nahed al Husaini, VT Bureau Chief Damascus – First published … October 27, 2019 – “The Russian Defence Ministry has no reliable information about US servicemen conducting an operation to ‘yet another’ elimination of the former Daesh leader Abu Bark al-Baghdadi in the Turkish-controlled part of the Idlib deescalation […]",
    "articleText": "S400 image …by Gordon Duff, Senior Editor and Nahed al Husaini, VT Bureau Chief Damascus – First published … October 27, 2019 – “The Russian Defence Ministry has no reliable information about US servicemen conducting an operation to ‘yet another’ elimination of the former Daesh leader Abu Bark al-Baghdadi in the Turkish-controlled part of the Idlib deescalation zone”, ministry spokesman Maj.Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. Russian intelligence inside Syria reported that their S400 radar systems which cover Idlib saw no American aircraft over the area where the Baghdadi raid was claimed. The Russians are very disappointed with Trump and say the US is putting Idlib’s huge al Qaeda force under joint command with a newly formed ISIS under American protection in Iraq and newly occupied areas of Syria where American forces just took over even more Syrian oil assets. From a private source: “America sees its big failure inside Iraq in that when the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia created ISIS, they did so while Syria with the exception of Kurdistan, was united. Now they are fostering a civil war first, then a new ISIS and the Kurdish region of Iraq is under nearly complete Israeli control. Baghdadi is part of this process, using his personal influence in Iraq’s Sunni community.” Russia has given Trump too much rope. Remember that in May 2018, the US claimed to have killed 300 Russian contractors who were moving with Syrian forces to secure the same oil fields in Deir Ezzor. Russia allowed the US to move American oil companies into Syria then were blackmailed to look the other way while Syria’s oil was looted, in order to maintain some American cooperation and to limit US operations against Damascus from US, Saudi and Israeli bases in the US occupied zone in Southern Syria, a zone America still holds and still plans to use to keep Damascus under direct threat. From Russia Today moments ago: Russia’s Defense Ministry said. The US coalition didn’t even carry out any airstrikes in Idlib recently. Earlier, Trump made a rare Sunday address from the White House informing the world that al-Baghdadi was eliminated in northwest Syria in a “daring nighttime raid” with the involvement of US special forces, planes, helicopters and drones. The Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) leader met his end “crying and screaming” in the face of the Americans’ might, he said. But the Russian Defense Ministry insisted that “there were legitimate questions and doubts about the very fact [of the US operation] and, especially, its success.” It also rejected Trump’s claims that Russian forces opened up the airspace under its control in Syria to American planes to facilitate the operation against the IS leader. Moscow pointed out that it recorded no US coalition airstrikes in the Idlib area in northwest Syria on Saturday when the raid was held. The ministry questioned the very possibility of al-Baghdadi’s presence in Idlib as the area is held by Al-Qaeda offshoot, Jabhat al-Nusra, who have always been mortal enemies of Islamic State. French Defense Minister Florence Parly also questioned the significance of the claimed US achievement, pointing out that the raid only marked “an early retirement for a terrorist [al-Baghdadi], but not for his organization.”=”Moscow noted that Islamic State was crushed in Syria in early 2018 in a joint effort by the government in Damascus and the Russian forces, meaning that yet another report of al-Baghdadi’s demise “bears no effect on the operational situation in Syria or on the actions of the remaining terrorists in Idlib.'” We have been told by Moscow, only moments ago, that Baghdadi is alive, healthy and working with the US in Iraq. This information is exclusive, directly from high level intelligence sources who are always right, and VT has proven time and time again. What we don’t know is whether Trump lied knowingly, something he does continually anyway, or is simply being handled. Now that Trump’s withdrawal from Syria has been reversed and all the troops sent to Iraq have now returned to Syria, 100% of them, just redeployed to Deir Ezzor from Hasakah, his “peace move” is now exposed as a total fake. More on that in a bit as to why, and what the Deep State has in store for Syria then Iran. Additionally, our sources inside Syria and Iraq tell us that Baghdadi was moved from Turkish protection, across the Eurphates and is now with US military intelligence inside Iraq. This kind of thing isn’t unusual, as fake terrorist leaders, built up by phony intelligence and in the “infotainment” industry are a valuable commodity. Let’s get the whole story first. * The Deep State is running a 4 pronged attack, beginning in Hong Kong, to pressure China toward making concessions, not on trade but on currency and banking, where China with other non-aligned partners threaten the Rothschild world banking system run through SWIFT with a secondary trade system and new currencies including crypto, challenging the endless fake crypto “pump and dump” that has already poured billions into organized crime coffers. Planning here is left to Google Corporation and Facebook, the defacto organizational heart of the Deep State and their AI capability. We are fearful for Mark Zuckerberg as due to his recent arrogance before Congress, he has become an embarrassment and may well be in personal danger, something that would break the hearts of any person who loves and admires Deep State toads. From Hong Kong, the mechanism that formerly organized color revolutions and blamed them on George Soros, began the Indian (Israeli) crackdown on Muslims inside Kashmir and attacks on Pakistan. Pakistan’s border crossings north of Kashmir had been attacked also but this project is a provocation against Imran Khan, trying to weaken his reform movement. Thousands of Indian troops are being fed into Kashmir where people are dragged out of their homes and beaten in the streets, India’s revenge against hundreds of years of Muslim and British rule. Behind this, however, is an arms race between China and India where Russia continually feeds technology into India, which keeps valuable contracts with China coming to Moscow. The problem behind this is that Israel has been manufacturing ICBMs in India, installing them in facilities that the US has built inside Israel, ICBMs capable of hitting North America, useless against Iran. These are missiles that could simulate a nuclear first strike on the US from Russia just like 9/11 simulated an Islamic terrorist attack on the US. This is all a creation of the fruitful mind of Benjamin Netanyahu. The next step was in Lebanon where very real demonstrations against a weak government are now being taken over, as in Ukraine, with agent provocateurs adding to violence and Saudi paid, and we mean thousands, fake demonstrators trying to retarget anti-government demonstrations against Hezbollah. Hezbollah’s intelligence services have traced all of this down and will likely retaliate against those involved in the Israeli-Saudi plot. Hezbollah, after years of fighting against the Deep State attempt to overthrow Syria and destroy Iraq and Iran, is now one of the most formidable military forces in the world, trained and armed by Russia and highly experienced. This is all coordinated with recent moves in Baghdad, riots that have killed nearly 100, that, in reality, should be demonstrating against ISIS-US-KRG-Turkish theft of nearly half of Iraq’s oil revenue since 2014 and nearly $1.5 trillion during the US occupation, which has led to cascading economic disasters and off the scale unemployment for years. A US backed puppet government still rules Iraq while commercial and economic life within that nation have left it a hollowed out shell with all cash moving to Dubai’s banks while Iraq rots. The Baghdadi move is coordinated with Lebanon and Baghdad uprisings, now seeded and controlled by the Deep State and the rise of a new ISIS fed by revenue from stolen Syrian and Iraqi oil. See Gordon Duff’s analysis, filmed only hours before the Baghdadi announcement, from this Press TV interview. (Begin at 3:40) Then, on October 26, 2019, Russia announced that their satellite images confirmed the US operation stealing Syrian oil. From Sputnike News:“Russia, citing satellite imagery, says the United States has been smuggling Syrian oil to other countries under the protection of its troops before and after the defeat of the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region.Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday that “the space intelligence images showed that oil was actively extracted and massively exported for processing outside Syria, under the reliable protection of US troops, before and after the defeat of the Daesh terrorists.”Konashenkov stressed that the convoys were guarded by US private military companies and special operations forces.”And then this: “Russia Concerned Over US Military Returning to Northern Syria Commenting on Esper’s statement that some US troops will remain in north-eastern Syria, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that the statement did not come as a surprise. “WHAT WASHINGTON DOES NOW – THE CAPTURE AND HOLDING UNDER ITS ARMED CONTROL OF OIL FIELDS IN EASTERN SYRIA IS, SIMPLY SPEAKING, INTERNATIONAL STATE BANDITISM,” HE STRESSED, ADDING THAT SYRIAN OIL RESERVES AND OTHER MINERAL RESOURCES BELONG SOLELY TO THE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC, NOT TO DAESH OR TO “AMERICAN PROTECTORS FROM DAESH TERRORISTS”. He also said that “neither international law, nor the American legislation itself can justify the US troops’ goal to guard Syrian hydrocarbon reserves from Syria itself and its people.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov suggested that the fresh contradictory signals the US has sent regarding Syria may indicate Washington’s desire to maintain conditions that allow for continued pressure on Damascus. “WE ARE VERY DEFINITELY WORRIED THAT THE SIGNALS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE MAY REFLECT THE SAME ATTITUDE: TO PRESERVE THE CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUING MULTI-COMPONENT PRESSURE ON THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITIES IN DAMASCUS”, HE POINTED OUT, ADDING THAT “THIS IS THE MOMENT WE DON’T AGREE AND WE CAN’T AGREE WITH THE UNITED STATES ON THE SITUATION.” What we are actually seeing is something far more sinister. You see, when Iraq is pushed to a civil war, and this is what is being done right now, orchestrated out of Israeli controlled Northern Syria or as it is called, the Kurdish Regional Government in Erbil, coordinated with US forces inside Iraq and Syria, a new ISIS is being built to justify more American troops inside Iraq. To do this successfully, a new and more controlled US backed government must be installed over the current puppet regime and Iranian influence erased, through another fake “color revolution” as is being attempted right now. From there, of course, a war on Iran can be staged, Iraqi oil revenue can be stolen to finance it and ISIS can be reconstituted as the US moves ISIS leaders that it had been keeping in training camps in Kurdish regions of Syria that recently “escaped” into the new US controlled zone on the Syrian Iraq’i border. Then of course, Mosul will be retaken, joined with Erbil, the MEK terror group will return to partner with ISIS and a new decade of war will ensue. Addendum I Bin Laden and the Deep State, Published in Russia Bin Laden’s Last Words …by Gordon Duff and New Eastern Outlook, Moscow – First published 23 May 2018 – On September 24, 2001, a dying Osama bin Laden released his last statement to the world. It is published below, the full CIA transcript with no redactions or editing. In this now declassified but heavily suppressed document, bin Laden describes the role of the Deep State in 9/11: “President Bush or any other US President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who made the attacks.” Bin Laden’s words – and we assert these are his last words – mean much more today than they did even while the ruins in New York and Washington were still smoldering. One might note that the “jet fuel” fires in New York burned for months, billions of BTU’s melting boots well into 2002. Bin Laden will explain the world today and tell the truths that warned the world of what was to come. His words are riveting. In March 2007, during an interview with Amy Goodman, former NATO commander, General Wesley Clark told of plans drafted by White House advisor and admitted architect of the Iraq War, Paul Wolfowitz, to invade 7 Middle Eastern nations including, not just Iraq, but Syria and Iran. The election of Barack Obama may have offset their timetable, but in light of Clark’s revelation made 11 years ago and “buried”, and bin Laden’s transcript, published below, events today are able to be seen in a different and perhaps “Hitleresque” light. From Salon, October 12, 2007: “In A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country, published by Palgrave Macmillan last month, the former four-star general recalls two visits to the Pentagon following the terrorist attacks of September 2001. On the first visit, less than two weeks after Sept. 11, he writes, a “senior general” told him, “We’re going to attack Iraq. The decision has basically been made.” Six weeks later, Clark returned to Washington to see the same general and inquired whether the plan to strike Iraq was still under consideration. The general’s response was stunning: “‘Oh, it’s worse than that,’ he said, holding up a memo on his desk. ‘Here’s the paper from the Office of the Secretary of Defense [then Donald Rumsfeld] outlining the strategy. We’re going to take out seven countries in five years.’ And he named them, starting with Iraq and Syria and ending with Iran.” While Clark doesn’t name the other four countries, he has mentioned in televised interviews that the hit list included Lebanon, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. Indeed, he has described this same conversation on a few occasions over the past year, including in a speech at the University of Alabama in October 2006, in an appearance on Amy Goodman’s “Democracy Now” broadcast last March, and most recently in an interview with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.” On “Democracy Now” he spoke about the meetings and the memo in slightly greater detail, saying that he had made the first Pentagon visit ‘on or about Sept. 20.’” The Death that was not a Death The world has never been told the truth about Osama bin Laden and 9/11. On December 11, 2001, the Pakistan Observer published an article announcing bin Laden’s death. They are generally a respected news source; and news agencies around the world, including Fox News and others in the US, reported the same. Moreover, in 2009 I was given direct access to documents at the headquarters of Pakistan’s intelligence and information agencies, the ISPR and ISI, where I met with directors of both agencies. We reviewed their files, along with other intelligence, and then had a roundtable discussion with their top analysts in a secure location in Rawalpindi. They said bin Laden was dead, that they had captured and interrogated witnesses, as grim pictures raced through my mind, but they were clear. Thus, when bin Laden showed up years later only to be “buried at sea” and his killers, a Navy SEAL team to suffer a catastrophic helicopter crash only days later, it became clear that the entire bin Laden story is a hoax. Bin Laden was kept alive as a “deception and cover” operation by the intelligence agencies of the US, Britain and Israel in order to justify a broad war intended to reshape the world map. The real architects of 911 saw how events, Sarajevo and Pearl Harbor could be used to create a world, not safe for democracy, but safe for banking, arms sales, and big oil. Background On May 1, 2014, a Federal Judge in New York ordered the Islamic State of Iran to pay $6bn in damages to the victims of 9/11. The case against Iran is unclear, and the process for suing Iran is equally obscure. In doing so, however, a door has been opened. Iran has decided to fight back, much as Russia has when accused of complicity in the use of deadly poison gas in both Britain and Syria. Russian FM Lavrov In both cases, Iran’s and Russia’s, nations believe their sacred honor has been violated by charges so heinous, perhaps even ridiculous, that reality itself is strained. In Russia’s case, they openly told the US that pushing such bizarre and unfounded accusations, much less using retaliatory force in response to “utter fiction,” violated all “unspoken rules of statecraft,” to paraphrase Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. What neither Russia nor Syria and Iran know, is that the Federal gag orders imposed by a secret grand jury in Houston, Texas – a grand jury impaneled not to investigate 9/11, but to administer the coverup – are to expire this year. Why This is Vital Less than two weeks after 9/11, the only proven statement on 9/11 made by Osama bin Laden was intercepted by the CIA station in Doha, Qatar. The date was September 24, 2001. Bin Laden had issued a statement, in Arabic, broadcast on an Al Jazeera channel, made to the people of Pakistan. Lee Wanta I mention Arabic while I add the fact that bin Laden, according to former White House Intelligence Advisor Lee Emil Wanta, spoke perfect English. I have spoken with Wanta on this several times, where he has outlined meetings with bin Laden in Peshawar, Pakistan, Ontario, California and in Washington DC, at the Metropolitan Club. Those meetings began during the 1980s when bin Laden worked for the CIA supplying weapons to the Mujahedeen; and the last meetings were far later than anyone would guess, with Wanta alleging bin Laden was receiving medical care at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland, while the US was searching for him in Sudan and elsewhere. True or not, details on meetings, which include discussions that included Oliver North and General Secord among others, will be available as testimony at some point if Iran seeks to fight the US in an international court. First, however, it is important to supply the first, last and only bin Laden statement. Once one reads this, it will become abundantly clear not only that bin Laden died in 2001 but that those who submitted all subsequent statements did so to obscure the truth. Of note, all alleged bin Laden videos and audio recordings received after September 24, 2001 came from one source, an Israeli intelligence officer born in Iraq named Rita Katz. Her “organization” was called SITE Intelligence and it had only one purpose at that time, to deceive the world about bin Laden and lead investigators away from one obvious suspect, Israel. The CIA memo, received by Veterans Today in 2010 through the Freedom of Information Act: “CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FOREIGN BROADCASTING INTERNATIONAL SERVICE: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY WEBSITE OF DOHA AL-JAZIRAH SATELLITE CHANNEL TELEVISION IN ARABIC [FBIS REPORT] WEBSITE OF DOHA AL-JAZIRAH SATELLITE CHANNEL TELEVISION IN ARABIC,INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATION FINANCED BY THE QATARI GOVERNMENT, WHICH CAN BE ACCESSEDAT URL: HTTP://WWW.ALJAZEERA.NET, CARRIES AT 2011 GMT ON 24 SEPTEMBER THE TEXT OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER BY USAMA BIN LADIN “TO THE PAKISTANI PEOPLE.” “We hope that these brothers would be the first martyrs in Islam’s battle in this age against the new Jewish crusade that is being led by the biggest crusader, Bush, under the banner of the cross. This battle is one of Islam’s immortal battles.” “We beseech God to grant him victory against the forces of infidelity and arrogance, and to crush the new crusader-Jewish campaign on the land of Pakistan and Afghanistan.” “I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States.” “Neither I had any knowledge of these attacks nor I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people. Such a practice is forbidden ever in the course of a battle.” “All that is going on in Palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of God upon the United States and Israel.” “Whoever committed the act of 11 September are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people, whereas in these attacks, the common American people have been killed. According to my information, the death toll is much higher than what the US Government has stated. “The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system, but are dissenting against it. Or those who are working for some other system; persons who want to make the present century as a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity so that their own civilization, nation, country, or ideology could survive.” “They can be any one, from Russia to Israel and from India to Serbia.” “Then you cannot forget the American Jews, who are annoyed with President Bush ever since the elections in Florida and want to avenge him.” “Then there are intelligence agencies in the US, which require billions of dollars worth of funds from the Congress and the government every year. This [funding issue] was not a big problem till the existence of the former Soviet Union but after that the budget of these (FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 180) agencies has been in danger. They needed an enemy. So, they first started propaganda against Usama and Taliban and then this incident happened.” “Drug smugglers from all over the world are in contact with the US secret agencies. These agencies do not want to eradicate narcotics cultivation and trafficking because their importance will be diminished. The people in the US Drug Enforcement Department are encouraging drug trade so that they could show performance and get millions of dollars worth of budget. General Noriega was made a drug baron by the CIA and, in need, he was made a scapegoat.” “President Bush or any other US President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who made the attacks.” “Supporting the US act is the need of some Muslim countries and the compulsion of others. However, they should think as to what will remain of their religious and moral position if they support the attack of the Christians and the Jews on a Muslim country like Afghanistan.” “I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom.” “This system is totally in control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is simply that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid by them. So, the punishment should reach Israel.” “The Western media is unleashing such a baseless propaganda, which make us surprise but it reflects on what is in their hearts and gradually they themselves become captive of this propaganda. They become afraid of it and begin to cause harm to themselves.” “Terror is the most dreaded weapon in modern age and the Western media is mercilessly using it against its own people. It can add fear and helplessness in the psyche of the people of Europe and the United States. It means that what the enemies of the United States cannot do, its media is doing that. You can understand as to what will be the performance of the nation in a war, which suffers from fear and helplessness.” FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY END OF OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT” The world long ago accepted that the Iraq invasion of 2003 was an illegal act of aggression and that both Bush and Blair, in a “perfect world,” should be hanged as war criminals. As noted from proof provided here, bin Laden never admitted complicity in 9/11, though audio tapes provided time and time again by Israeli intelligence asserted as much. Were those tapes an admission by Israel, if seen in light of what we know of “fake news” today, of their role in 9/11? Was 9/11 staged to bring down, as General Clark may well be asserting, a way of pushing forward a master plan to take down Iraq, Syria, Iran and four other nations? Has America, now that Israeli policy and neocon politics are predominant, moved back to the same direction, to conquest of Israel’s neighbors? How do bin Laden’s words play so long after what we assert was the date of his real death? In light of his September 24, 2001 statement, is it perhaps obvious why a fake bin Laden, vilified by the equally fake media, was needed to push the wars that never seem to end?

    "articleText": "By Nauman Sadiq, VT Islamabad According to a New York Times report [1], the surprising information about the Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts came following the arrest and interrogation of one of al-Baghdadi’s wives and a courier in Iraq this past summer. The report details the chronology of the US Special Ops overnight raid: “Around midnight Sunday morning — 5 p.m. Saturday in Washington — eight American helicopters, primarily CH-47 Chinooks, took off from a military base near Erbil, Iraq. Flying low and fast to avoid detection, the helicopters quickly crossed the Syrian border and then flew all the way across Syria itself — a dangerous 70-minute flight in which the helicopters took sporadic groundfire — to the Barisha area just north of Idlib city, in western Syria.” Before the publishing of the NY Times report, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported earlier [2] on Sunday that a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by warplanes belonging to the international coalition, had attacked positions of Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, in Idlib province where the Islamic State chief was believed to be hiding. Despite detailing the operational minutiae of the Special Ops raid, however, the NY Times deliberately elided over the crucial piece of information that the compound in Barisha village 5 km. from Turkish border where al-Baghdadi was killed belonged to Hurras al-Din, which has previously been targeted several times in the US airstrikes. Although Hurras al-Din is generally assumed to be an al-Qaeda affiliate, it is in fact regrouping of the Islamic State’s jihadists in northwestern Idlib after the latter terrorist organization was routed from Mosul and Raqqa and was hard pressed by the US-led coalition’s air raids in eastern Syria. It’s worth pointing out that the distinction between Islamic jihadists and purported “moderate rebels” in Syria is more illusory than real. Before it turned rogue and overran Mosul in Iraq in June 2014, Islamic State used to be an integral part of the Syrian opposition and enjoyed close ideological and operational ties with other militant groups in Syria. Thus, though practically impossible, even if Washington does eliminate all Islamic State militants from Syria, what would it do with myriads of other militant outfits in Syria, particularly with tens of thousands of al-Nusra Front jihadists, including the transnational terrorists of Hurras al-Din, who have carved out a new sanctuary in Syria’s northwestern Idlib governorate since 2015? The only practical solution to the conundrum is to withdraw all American troops from Syria and let Damascus establish writ of the state over all of Syria in order to eliminate all militant groups from Syria, including the jihadists of the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front and Hurras al-Din, though the foreign policy hawks in Washington might have objections to strengthening the hands of Iran and Russia in Syria. Before the evacuation of 1,000 American troops from northern Syria to western Iraq, the Pentagon had 2,000 US forces in Syria. After the drawdown of US troops at Erdogan’s insistence in order for Ankara to mount a ground offensive in northern Syria, the US still has 1,000 troops, mainly in oil-rich, eastern Deir al-Zor province and at al-Tanf military base. Al-Tanf military base is strategically located in southeastern Syria on the border between Syria, Iraq and Jordan, and it sits on a critically important Damascus-Baghdad highway, which serves as a lifeline for Damascus. Washington has illegally occupied 55-kilometer area around al-Tanf since 2016, and several hundred US Marines have trained several Syrian militant groups there. It’s worth noting that rather than fighting the Islamic State, the purpose of continued presence of the US forces at al-Tanf military base is to address Israel’s concerns regarding the expansion of Iran’s influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Washington’s interest in the Syrian proxy war has been mainly about ensuring Israel’s regional security. The United States Defense Intelligence Agency’s declassified report [3] of 2012 clearly spelled out the imminent rise of a Salafist principality in northeastern Syria – in Raqqa and Deir al-Zor which were occupied by the Islamic State until October 2017 – in the event of an outbreak of a civil war in Syria. Under pressure from the Zionist lobby in Washington, however, the former Obama administration deliberately suppressed the report and also overlooked the view in general that a proxy war in Syria would give birth to radical Islamic jihadists. The hawks in Washington were fully aware of the consequences of their actions in Syria, but they kept pursuing the ill-fated policy of nurturing militants in the training camps located in Syria’s border regions with Turkey and Jordan in order to weaken the anti-Zionist Syrian government. The single biggest threat to Israel’s regional security was posed by the Iranian resistance axis, which is comprised of Tehran, Damascus and their Lebanon-based surrogate, Hezbollah. During the course of 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets into northern Israel and Israel’s defense community realized for the first time the nature of threat that Hezbollah and its patrons posed to Israel’s regional security. Those were only unguided rockets but it was a wakeup call for Israel’s military strategists that what will happen if Iran passed the guided missile technology to Hezbollah whose area of operations lies very close to the northern borders of Israel. Therefore, the Zionist lobbies in Washington literally coerced then-President Obama to coordinate a proxy war against Damascus and its Lebanon-based surrogate Hezbollah in order to dismantle the Iranian resistance axis against Israel. Over the years, Israel has not only provided medical aid and material support to militant groups battling Damascus – particularly to various factions of the Free Syria Army (FSA) and al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate al-Nusra Front in Daraa and Quneitra bordering the Israel-occupied Golan Heights – but Israel’s air force virtually played the role of air force of Syrian jihadists and conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Syria during the eight-year conflict. In an interview to New York Times [4] in January, Israel’s outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. General Gadi Eisenkot confessed that the Netanyahu government approved his shift in strategy in January 2017 to step up airstrikes in Syria. Consequently, more than 200 Israeli airstrikes were launched against the Syrian targets in 2017 and 2018, as revealed [5] by the Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz in September last year. In 2018 alone, Israel’s air force dropped 2,000 bombs in Syria. The purpose of Israeli airstrikes in Syria has been to degrade Iran’s guided missile technology provided to Damascus and Hezbollah, which poses an existential threat to Israel’s regional security. Though after Russia provided S-300 missile system to the Syrian military after a Russian surveillance plane was shot down in Syria on September 18 last year, killing 15 Russians onboard, Israel’s airstrikes in Syria have been significantly reduced.

    "articleText": "Russia, citing satellite imagery, says the United States has been smuggling Syrian oil to other countries under the protection of its troops before and after the defeat of the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday that “the space intelligence images showed that oil was actively extracted and massively exported for processing outside Syria, under the reliable protection of US troops, before and after the defeat of the Daesh terrorists.” Konashenkov stressed that the convoys were guarded by US private military companies and special operations forces. “Tank trucks guarded by US military servicemen and private military companies smuggle oil from fields in eastern Syria to other countries and in the event of any attack on such a convoy, US special operations forces and combat aviation are immediately used to protect it,” Konashenkov said. The Russian defense ministry spokesman added that the Syrian oil was extracted with the use of the equipment supplied by leading Western corporations bypassing all US sanctions. Given that the cost of one barrel of oil smuggled from Syria is $38, the monthly revenue of that “private business” exceeds $30 million, Russia’s TASS news agency quoted Konashenkov as saying. “Revenues from smuggling Syrian oil arrive at numbered bank accounts of US private military companies and intelligence services through brokerage firms that interact with it,” Konashenkov said. “To secure such a continuous financial flow free from control and taxes, the top officials at the Pentagon and Langley will be willing to guard and protect oil wells in Syria from the imaginary ‘hidden cells’ of Daesh indefinitely.” In a major U-turn in US military policy, the White House announced on October 6 that the US would be withdrawing its forces from northeastern Syria, clearing the path for an expected Turkish incursion into the region. Three days later, Turkey launched the offensive with the aim of purging the northern Syrian regions near its border of US-backed Kurdish militants, whom it views as terrorists linked to local autonomy-seeking militants of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). On Thursday, US President Donald Trump approved of a new plan to keep 500 American troops in northeastern Syria to allegedly protect oil fields and keep them from falling into the hands of the Daesh terrorist group. PressTV-‘US may keep 500 troops in Syria to control oil fields’ The White House is planning to keep 500 US troops in northeastern Syria to guard oil fields there, according to a report. Pentagon chief Mark Esper confirmed on Friday that the United States plans to strengthen its military positions in Syria’s Dayr al-Zawr province in the near future to allegedly prevent terrorists from accessing oil fields. The United States is studying how to move forces in the region “to ensure the safety of oil fields,” Esper added. MOSCOW (Sputnik) – The Russian Defense Ministry published satellite intelligence images proving that oil from Syria was sent abroad under the guard of US servicemen before and after the defeat of the Daesh terrorists, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Saturday. The ministry said that “the space intelligence images showed that oil was actively extracted and massively exported for processing outside Syria, under the reliable protection of US troops, before and after the defeat of the Daesh* terrorists.” © PHOTO : MINISTRY OF DEFENCE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION Oil transit vehicles gather in Deir ez-Zor Province, Syria, 10 km east of Al Mayadin Commenting on the satellite intelligence, Maj. Gen. Konashenkov said US operations in eastern Syria and its actions regarding Syrian oil could only be described as “international state banditism.” He added that Syria’s oil belongs to the Arab Republic, and not to Daesh or to “American protectors from Daesh.” According to Russian intelligence, the illegal US-supervised extraction of Syrian oil was being carried out by “leading American corporations” and private military contractors, with US special forces and air power used for protection. Konashenkov said the estimated monthly revenue of this ‘private enterprise’ was over $30 million, and that for that kind of money, the Pentagon and the CIA would be “ready to ‘guard’ Syrian oil wells from ‘hidden Daesh cells’ indefinitely.” © PHOTO : MINISTRY OF DEFENCE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION Oil transit vehicles gather near Al-Omar oil station in Deir ez-Zor Province, Syria, 14 km east of Al Mayadin The Defence Ministry spokesman pointed to several examples of the US-led operations. On August 23, satellites picked up a cluster of about 90 vehicles, including 23 tanker trucks, clustered at the Daman collection point, about 42 km east of Deir ez-Zor province. Then, on September 5, 25 vehicles, 22 of them fuel trucks, were spotted in Hasakah province. On September 8, 36 more vehicles, 32 of them tankers, were spotted in the vicinity of Der ez-Zor, with 41 more vehicles, 34 of them fuel trucks, spotted in the Mayadin area in Deir ez-Zor. Konashenkov cited a US-controlled company called ‘Sadcab’ or ‘Sedcab’ created under the auspicies of the local Kurdish autonomy, was charged with exporting the oil, with proceeds going to numbered accounts of US military contractors and intelligence services. Russian map of the strategic situation in Syria as of October 26, 2019. Orange areas indicate Syrian government control. Sand-coloured areas indicate Syrian Kurdish control. Brown and dark brown indicates ‘deescalation zone’ and ‘demilitarised zone’ and baby blue indicates control by pro-American forces. Pentagon chief Mark Esper said Friday that the US intended to take measures in the near future to strengthen its position in the Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor in order to prevent terrorists from accessing oil fields. According to the defense secretary, Washington is studying how to move forces in the region so that “to ensure the safety of oil fields.” President Trump raised eyebrows in a tweet last week when he said the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces was “holding up nicely” and that the US had “secured the Oil.” In Saturday’s presentation, the Russian military offered insights into the scale and scope of the oil Mr. Trump appeared to be talking about.

    "description": "A new study shows how canines trained to find human remains could help archaeologists locate new sites",
    "articleText": "(Vedrana Glavaš /Department of Archaeology,Univerity of Zadar) Canine Archaeologists Sniff Out 3,000-Year-Old Graves in Croatia by Jason Daley/Smithsonian.com Dogs have helped law enforcement and search-and-rescue crews discover human remains for decades. But recently, a new group has enlisted the help of canines and their olfactory superpowers: archaeologists. In a recent paper in the Journal of Archeological Method and Theory, Vedrana Glavaš, an archaeologist at the University of Zadar in Croatia, and Andrea Pintar, a cadaver dog handler, describe how dogs trained to find human remains helped them track down gravesites dating to around 700 B.C. For The Guardian, Joshua Rapp Learn reports that the team tested the dogs at a hilltop fort called Drvišica along Croatia’s Adriatic coast. Previously, Glavaš had identified tombs in a necropolis near the fort and wanted to find more. However, the irregular, rocky terrain made it difficult to just randomly excavate suspected burial sites. So, in 2015, she decided to contact Pintar, who trains cadaver dogs typically used in criminal cases. Cadaver dogs are champions at finding remains that are just hours and even several decades old. But the team wasn’t sure if sensitive canine noses could detect the scent of death—actually, the more than 400 scents of death; decomposition releases hundreds of complex compounds—after 2,700 years in the ground.

    "articleText": "By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor Two years ago, VT and staff were accused of working for Russian intelligence by Newsweek, Politico and the Washington Post. Yet, years before, we were banned from RT and Sputnik News even though, at one time, I had personally been offered control of both media platforms by Russia. This was a job I didn’t need. We always depended on RT and Sputnik for getting out the truth, blended with self-serving crap as well, but always superior to America’s totally controlled media. We are the media experts, with over a century (almost 2) of training in psychological warfare and propaganda, and lots of “OJT” at the highest levels in a dozen governments. Nothing is left. Like Washington, a city of 100% whores, a price tag on everything and everyone (now even worse under Trump), there is no independent press of any kind. We investigate everyone, their credit ratings, their work history, their friends, who pays their travel, their writing style and if they even write their own material. The entire media, from bloggers to Nobel Prize winners, all whores. As for the reality of civil war. First of all, I am a combat vet. I went through training with “ghetto rats” and “good old boys” and then got to see who was what in real combat. All the internet heroes and trolls, and I remember their fathers and grandfathers crying for mama when the VC came calling…the back woods gun owning mouth breathers…are worthless. The military never wanted them and got rid of them soon as possible, generally putting them as far from combat as possible in Vietnam and after. The South died after the Civil War just as World War I killed Britain and France. There is no real Germany today. The generation we killed off in Vietnam is responsible for the worms pretending to be “real Americans” today. There won’t be a civil war. The military isn’t going to take over anything. The Taliban took them all to school, taught them the reality you won’t read about. Tough guys? Look to Russia or the Syrian Arab Army or Iran or the Houthis in Yemen. Go screw with the Cubans, they will hand you your ass. As for America, we built a military out of lying, stealing and fakery. Americans haven’t fought for ‘their country’ in, how long? Ever? The real answer is “ever.” Before the ink was dry on the Declaration of Independence, the Rothschilds were buying Federalists to do their bidding, eventually turning out a Constitution that has stifled freedom for over 200 years. Everything we know of ourselves is lies. As for our “tough guys” today, America fights with mercenaries, we are pimped out by Washington and do the bidding of Saudi Arabia and the same bankers who tried to choke America to death in 1812 and again in 1861 and finally killed us in 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act. We then have done nothing but fight wars for banks, two bank driven world wars, a fake cold war, fake war on terror and are enslaved by a criminal underclass that runs Washington. Real Americans? They wait for nuclear war, not caring as long as Washington and New York get it first. From Russia Today: Liberals outing Trump donors as ‘racist’ could lead America to full-blown civil war Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. Former Editor-in-Chief of The Moscow News, he is author of the book, ‘Midnight in the American Empire,’ released in 2013. 25 Oct, 2019 16:10 / Updated 4 minutes ago Get short URL © Global Look Press / Peter Marshall 3 Follow RT on It would be difficult to name a dirtier political trick than calling opponents ‘racist’ and publicly disclosing their names. Is this mere dress rehearsal for the 2020 US election, or something far worse? Today in America, when a sizable segment of the population is suffering from the acute, long-term effects of Trump Derangement Syndrome, even the simple act of supporting a political candidate – especially if the candidate’s name happens to be Donald Trump – can make a person not only feel like a criminal, but treated like one as well. And that’s not mere hyperbole. Consider the following. In the US, when sexual predators are released back into the general population after serving out their prison sentence, they are required to register themselves in a state data bank. This is no dating site. Its purpose is to inform Americans if a potentially dangerous individual will be residing in their neighborhood, possibly in the vicinity of their children. This is the sort of blacklist most Americans could probably agree with. But what about a blacklist made up of American voters who have had their names and addresses dumped into the public realm for the ‘crime’ of donating money to the Trump campaign? When it is remembered that supporting political parties and candidates with cash is a democratic form of ‘free speech’, it sounds almost too incredible to imagine. VICE News ✔@vicenews VIDEO: Protester spits on Trump supporter during interview at Minneapolis rally http://bit.ly/316o5J7 3,075 2:03 PM – Oct 11, 2019 Twitter Ads info and privacy 2,913 people are talking about this Yet that is exactly what happened this week when an obscure group that fashions itself as the Public Media Service Group, Inc. released the personal information of Trump donors across the country – complete with little red flags – in a shocking invasion of privacy. If there were a better way of triggering civil strife in the US, I personally cannot imagine it. But it gets worse. What is particularly disturbing and deranged about this “mapping of recent Trump donors,” however, is that the now disabled website screamed ‘RACIST WATCH’ in large font at the top of the page, followed by the paranoid question: “Do your neighbors support a president that supports racism and hate speech?” Far Left Watch@FarLeftWatch For the last 4 years, far-left extremist have violently assaulted Trump supporters and their attacks are escalating. Now an activist group has launched a website called “Racist Watch” that maps out the name and address of every individual who donated to Trump’s 2016 campaign. 3,200 3:55 PM – Oct 21, 2019 Twitter Ads info and privacy 3,601 people are talking about this Aside from its embrace of the Orwellian act of snitching on neighbors and loved ones, it also takes it on faith that the US president is some kind of xenophobic megalomaniac hell-bent on driving all foreigners out of the country. Thus far, however, much of those media-baked claims that say ‘Trump is a racist’ derive from his campaign pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border. If that makes Trump a racist, then the overwhelming majority of state leaders around the world must also be categorized as such since most governments still consider it their responsibility to protect their national borders in the name of security. That is not racism; that is common sense. The most important consideration here, however, is not Donald Trump, who has a vast security apparatus at his disposal to protect him wherever he goes. What about those outed Trump donors who have been tarred and feathered on a ‘Racist Watch’ website. What next? Will they be required to wear some kind of conspicuous insignia in public, much like the Jews were identified by yellow stars in Nazi-occupied Europe, to identify their ‘racist’ affiliation? Will Trump supporters be forced to knock on the doors of their neighbors, admitting with all the guilt they can muster that they donated money to the mogul of Manhattan? Pray tell, what kind of insanity has gripped God’s Country? Such public blacklisting, aside from appearing as a scare tactic ahead of one of the most momentous presidential elections in recent history, places Trump donors at no small personal risk. Just ask Tucker Carlson, the Fox News conservative host. Late last year, Antifa, the left-wing, mask-wearing protest group known for gratuitous displays of unprovoked violence, showed up late one night outside Carlson’s family home, chanting “Tucker Carlson we will fight, we know where you sleep at night” and “racist scumbag leave town.” These ‘progressive’ liberals, having cried ‘racist’ on so many occasions in the past, risk suffering the same fate as the little boy who cried wolf once too often. Just this week, for example, Democrats screamed ‘racism’ over a political poster that depicts the mayor of San Francisco as – perish the thought! – a wealthy elitist. ALSO ON RT.COMDemocrats cry racism over campaign poster showing black SF mayor smoking with stack of moneyThe poster, paid for by a Republican opponent, shows a cartoon caricature of Mayor London Breed in a red dress sitting with her high heels propped up on a desk. She is holding a stack of dollars in her left hand and a cigarette in the right. Such elitist cliches have been used myriad times in the past to portray white male power structures without any outcry over ‘racism’. Yet when the concept is applied to a minority black woman, the PC police are duly notified and a full-blown political crisis is declared. The message here is that minorities are beyond all reproach. Thankfully, a number of people took to social media to point out the double standards and hypocrisy. Scott Wiener ✔@Scott_Wiener · Oct 20, 2019 This racist campaign billboard against Mayor @LondonBreed is disgusting & has no place in our political discourse. The candidate for Mayor who placed the billboard, Ellen Zhao, is a Trump supporter, so, while despicable, this racism isn’t surprising. https://abc7news.com/politics/controversial-billboard-depicts-sf-mayor-smoking-holding-stack-of-bills/5632377/ … Controversial billboard in SF depicts Mayor Breed with her feet up, smoking, and holding stack of… Ellen Lee Zhou, a San Francisco social worker running for Mayor of San Francisco, paid for a billboard that has raised controversy in the SoMa district. abc7news.com Mark Fabela@markdfabela I think you dropped this. 75 6:28 PM – Oct 20, 2019 Twitter Ads info and privacy 15 people are talking about this Meanwhile, there is real irony in the liberal campaign to toss the ‘racist’ epitaph around with reckless abandon. In fact, if a group of enraged Liberals took up the ‘Racist Watch’ challenge and appeared at the homes of the blacklisted people, they might be very surprised to discover who lives at these addresses. There is a chance they would come face-to-face with popular video bloggers Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, two African-Americans better known as ‘Diamond and Silk’, who have thrown their support behind Donald Trump. Or perhaps they would show up at the door of actor and comedian Terrence K. Williams, another African-American pro-Trump commentator who has left a mark on social media. And I would really hope, for their sake, that some misguided liberal protesters never have the misfortune of protesting against racism outside the house of Candace Owens, one of the most vocal African-American supporters of Trump, as well as one of the biggest critics of the Democratic Party today. The lesson here is that while racism certainly exists in the United States, it does not appear to be anywhere near the five-alarm levels as the PC police would have us believe. The racist hysteria is being politically driven in an effort to portray Trump and his millions of supporters as sub-human xenophobes and ‘haters’. This is the way the liberals hope to steal the White House in 2020, by cheap fearmongering. Fortunately, many Americans are ‘woke’ to the scam. @Robert_Bridge Loading...

Our sources tell us that Madsen was given much more than this but for some reason chose not to publish or withheld. Either way, what he did publish was devastating and ignored. We know that FBI agent, Colonel Mike Dick, who has now taken a payoff, went to Madsen and offered up surveillance files proving Israel’s involvement in 9/11 beyond any reasonable doubt. Smith also sent extensive files to Madsen. There is another story here that we won’t go into. Everything needed to totally blow open 9/11 was “out there” in 2005, enough to end all talk about nanothermite or bin Laden or secret space weapons or other fairy tales. The proof, hard documents, photos, all were there. The story of how this leak was closed even after Madsen’s limited reports, should be investigated. Some of that story is below. This is not going to be a compendium of 9/11 facts nor a retelling of the narrative. This is simply a “stand alone” based on what current news reporting requires. Jeff Smith was part of the investigation team known as Able Danger. Smith, a nuclear physicist and former IAEA nuclear inspector, was brought over from his investigation of stolen nuclear weapons (where he was personally supervised by George H. W. Bush and worked with CIA agent Roland Carnaby) to join the FBI team headed by first John O’Neill and then Colonel Michael Dick of the FBI. _________ “No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn.” ― Jim Morrison By Jeff Smith The missing 28 pages has been sanitized. It does not cover Atta at all and it does not cover Florida and Ft. Lee or how they got their visas. All FBI field reports on the hijackers stop at least two months before 911. This is when Chertoff stepped in and shut down all surveillance on them. That part is still classified. However the money chart shows that the secondary players got paid at least 750.000$ ea. Atta got more. This is the smoking gun. Follow the HSBC, BCCI money trail to Mossad. Now you know why Mike Dick went into hiding. (Mike, after filing suit against the FBI for trying to have him murdered, now has a fat job at Quantico) Michael Chertoff – was he a national security risk? After 911, Dick, as well as the CIA, NOC were harassed by their superiors on orders “from above.” Those orders came from Chertoff. Dick was first relieved of his primary counter-espionage duties, eventually sent to Pakistan to investigate the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and eventually buried in a desk job at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC. According to the CIA source, Pearl was murdered because he was getting too close to the money trail that financed 911. The bottom line is that the award-winning, 28-page 911 secret report is a total whitewash. It totally ignores other agencies’ input such as the DEA. It hides the Florida air school owned by Sutter and eradicated by the Bushes. It ignores the last 4 months before the hijacking; it has no mention of Atta at all. It does not cover the CIA-issued visas from Saudi, etc, etc. How do we know if it is even real after 15 years and not a fake? They never questioned Mike Dick or anybody else. It’s as if they only looked at what they were told to look at, and nothing else. Mike followed the money trail, so did Pearl, and look where it got them. Anyone not on their payroll got burned, i.e. a “Burn Notice”. Mike and myself are both poster children for that one. (Jeff is under gag order by a Texas-based Federal Grand Jury that is withholding proof of Mossad’s role in 9/11, including physical evidence and active surveillance of the 9/11 attack itself.) IT WILL NEVER GO TO TRIAL JUST, LIKE WITH KENNEDY, BECAUSE IT IS TOO DIRTY FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. OUR GOVERNMENT IS JUST ONE BIG CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, AND THERE ARE NOTHING BUT CRIMINALS IN POWER, TO QUOTE STALIN… History has been written by the victors again. Mike sold out and took the buy out. He had no choice. Now he is gagged by security clearances, etc. So there are no witnesses left that can tell the truth and be believed. All evidence has been destroyed. Anyone knowing anything has been eliminated or sold out. This is how they work. Divide, conquer and destroy from within. In my case, I have been told to shut up (redacted). Remember, it’s an election year. So you don’t want to cross the wrong person in power. Clearing the Baffles for 911 (excerpt) By Wayne Madsen The one individual who stands tall among those intelligence and law enforcement officers who was aggressively pursuing the criminal network that would carry out 911 was FBI counter-terrorism top man John O’Neill. Ever since the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, O’Neill’s pursuit of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda had been dogged. After further terrorist attacks at the Khobar Towers barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia ; the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania ; and the USS Cole in Aden harbor, O’Neill’s biggest problem was not Al Qaeda, it was resistance from top officials inside the U.S. government. Khobar Towers bombing According to classified documents from French intelligence, Al Qaeda and Bin Laden had still been under the operational control of U.S. and British “security services” until 1995, fully two years after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. As of 1996, the U.S. State Department continued to refuse to list Al Qaeda as a terrorist organization. After the 1996 bombings of the Khobar Towers that killed nineteen U.S. military personnel, the State Department under Secretary of State Warren Christopher, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and the Saudi government did everything they could to obstruct O’Neill’s investigation. In his aggressive pursuit of Al Qaeda, O’Neill, according to people who worked closely with him, began to have serious concerns over complicity by those inside the Clinton and Bush administrations. There was the mysterious theft in the summer of 2000 of his briefcase at a Tampa hotel during a retirement seminar where the only other participants were 150 other FBI agents. In the briefcase were a few classified emails and a classified document called the Annual Field Office Report, a summary of the New York FBI’s office counter-terrorist and counter-intelligence operations, including one very sensitive investigation being conducted by another New York counter-intelligence FBI special agent, Michael Dick. Although a lighter, cigar cutter, and expensive pen were stolen, the papers were all accounted for when the briefcase turned up 90 minutes later at another nearby hotel. Ninety minutes, of course, was sufficient time to photocopy the documents and discover what O’Neill knew about both Al Qaeda and their Israeli shadows. Special Agent Dick, who worked closely with O’Neill, had discovered a troubling ring of Israeli movers operating in the New York and New Jersey areas. Furthermore, some of these Israelis not only had connections with Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies but were also shadowing Arab and Muslims that had been under investigation as potential terrorist cells. But the Israelis were acting independently and there was no effort made to inform the FBI or local police of any intelligence they were obtaining on their targets. Further frustrating Dick’s counter-espionage activities against the Israelis was the fact that they were using communications methods that made it almost impossible to conduct communications surveillance: they used Verizon pre-paid cell phones, two-way Nextel walkie-talkies, and Internet cafes. At the same time, the DEA had discovered a nationwide ring of Israeli “art students,” many of whom had past connections to Israeli intelligence and military demolition units, were operating in and around New York and New Jersey. What the DEA did not realize was that the art students were also shadowing the very same Arab cells that would later carry out the 911 attacks. Ex-FBI John O’Neil – KIA on 9-11 And the DEA had become aware of a drug connection between the Russian-Israeli Mafia in Colombia and the globe trotting Saudi Prince Nayif al Saud. The DEA’s Operation Millennium was directed against this network, which largely took down most of the network in June 1999, when 808 kilograms of cocaine were seized in Paris. Later the DEA, in June 2000, the DEA declassified a “SECRET DEA-6” report from the DEA’s BCO (Bogota Country Office) so that the PCO (Paris Country Office) could share the intelligence on Saudi cocaine smuggling operations with the Paris police. The DEA and French law enforcement had compiled tons of evidence that Prince Nayif was transporting cocaine to support some major event. The DEA report stated that Nayif stated that Allah had authorized him to sell drugs and that later his reason for selling the drugs would become known. It is significant that Nayif did not use alcohol, tobacco or drugs. Nayif claimed diplomatic immunity and the Saudi government threatened France and the Clinton administration with withholding lucrative contracts if they pursued their prince. Because of O’Neill’s close contacts with DEA, this intelligence would have been made known to him as well. The Saudi cocaine smuggling network involved organized crime elements tied to the Russian-Israeli Mafia in Miami; Medellin, Colombia; Marbella and Barcelona, Spain; Venezuela; Geneva; and the Netherlands. According to the DEA report, Nayif fathered a child with a woman named Doris Salazar, a Colombian national residing in Miami. The report also states that an organized crime figure only identified as “Pepe,” a Cuban American who ran a “large section of the Miami Port ” and who came to Florida during the 1978 Mariel boat lift, was involved with Nayif in “protecting narcotic shipments upon arrival in the Miami port.” The declassified SECRET DEA-6 report contains the names of a number of cooperating witnesses in the investigation of Nayif and the cocaine smuggling network and the author takes seriously the statement in the document: “Protect identities of the cooperating defendants.” The DEA originally became interested in the Israelis because they suspected they were involved in an Israeli Mafia Ecstasy smuggling ring. However, it soon became clear that the DEA had stumbled across something much larger – not only were DEA offices and homes of DEA agents around the country being cased by the Israelis, but they were also targeting Federal judges, U.S. Marshals, Environmental Protection Agency law enforcement officers, and FBI agents for surveillance. It also became clear to the DEA that the Israeli art students were also involved with certain Colombians. On March 22, 2002, at the Oak Hills Apartment Complex in Irving, Texas, DEA agents arrested Israeli art student Dahan Eldad, along with Elsa Beatriz Africano-Leon, a Colombian national. On March 27, DEA agents arrested four other Israelis in the same apartment complex, including Aran Ofek, who said his father was a retired Israeli army two-star general. A $10,000 bond for another arrested Israeli, Michal Gal, was placed by Ophir Baer, an employee of Israeli telecommunications firm AMDOCS, Inc., a firm with operational access to the telephones being used by FBI agents John O’Neill, Michael Dick, and the DEA agents involved in tracking the Saudi/Mafia cocaine shipments being used to support various terrorist and intelligence cells in the United States and abroad. On April 11, 2001, a DEA agent and a Fredericksburg, Virginia policeman questioned two female Israeli “art student” nationals at the shopping center in Fredericksburg. The passport for Yael Gavish contained some interesting entry/exit visas: 13 December 2000, entry into Bogota, Colombia and 5 February 2001, exit visa from Bogota. In addition, on 5 February there was a possible entry visa for Panama, which was followed by a 9 March 2001 entry visa in New York City. Gavish’s colleague Meirav Balhams had a New York State identity card listing her address as 354 Paterson Plank Rd., Jersey City, New Jersey. An FBI 9-11 suspect list dated February 22, 2002 lists Dominik Suter, along with an Ornit Levinson, a.k.a., Omit Suter, with an address of 312 Pavonia Avenue, Jersey City. Dominik Suter was the head of Urban Moving Systems of nearby Weehawken, the base of operations for two white vans with the same rear license plate that were seen parked at the Doric Apartments (near Patterson Plank Road) and at Liberty State Park at the same time the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The occupants of both vans, all Israelis, were seen celebrating the attack while dressed in Arab garb. Five Israelis in one of the vans were later arrested by the local police and FBI near Giant Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey in the late afternoon of September 11. O’Neill’s FBI colleague, Mike Dick, aggressively investigated this Israeli ring before and after 911. But like O’Neill, he soon found himself removed from his duties on the orders of the then-head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division Michael Chertoff. Dick was very suspicious when Israeli movers quickly moved Zim American Israeli Shipping Company out of its 10,000 square feet of office space on the 17th Floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The partially Israeli state-owned firm forfeited a $50,000 security deposit when it terminated its lease and vacated the building one week prior to 911. According to a non official cover (NOC) CIA source who worked with Dick, Israeli movers moved explosives into the 17th Floor office space after Zim moved out. After 911, Dick as well as the CIA NOC were harassed by their superiors on orders “from above.” Those orders came from Chertoff. Dick was first relieved of his primary counter-espionage duties, eventually sent to Pakistan to investigate the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and eventually buried in a desk job at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC. According to the CIA source, Pearl was murdered because he was getting too close to the money trail that financed 911. The CIA source said, “the same group that beheaded Pearl in Pakistan did the beheadings in Iraq.” The source added that the beheadings were “not Al Qaeda.” The CIA source, who emphasized his past Republican credentials, emphasized that Al Qaeda was merely a “list” of arms dealers, mercenaries, drug dealers, financiers, and terrorists used by the CIA and Saudis during the Afghan Mujaheddin War against the Soviets. The source also iterated that all the 911 hijackers had fake IDs. During a joint CIA-FBI operation against lead hijacker Mohammed Atta in Fort Lee, New Jersey in 2000, the CIA and FBI team leaders complained to their superiors that their operation was being photographed by Israeli agents, thus compromising the operation. The CIA source affirmed that the Israelis in New Jersey were providing cover for the future hijacker teams. Madeleine Albright It was not the first run-in by the CIA operative with the Israelis. He once caught a senior U.S. diplomat with close ties to Israel taking bribes from Moroccan government officials to write favorable reports on Morocco’s continued control over disputed and oil and mineral rich Western Sahara. Attempts to follow the diplomat’s laundered money were rebuffed by Madeleine Albright’s State Department. The problems at the top of the CIA and FBI, said the source, existed since the Russian/Soviet spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen were able to penetrate the top levels of both agencies. “They got there with help,” said the source. O’Neill decided that because his own agency was stymieing his own investigative leads, he relied on DEA to handle his most sensitive inquiries and communications. Although DEA memos later suggested that Israeli telecommunications companies, under contract to the Justice Department, may have penetrated sensitive DEA communications as part of an intelligence operation, O’Neill was sure that his communications at the FBI were totally compromised and forced to rely on the DEA because of both internal political pressure from the FBI and Justice Department leadership and his fear that his communications were being wiretapped. O’Neill also relied on French intelligence to obtain wiretap information on Al Qaeda cells. O’Neill was certain that the Saudi government and oil industry-centric members of the Bush administration were behind the Al Qaeda network. He was also aware of repeated negotiations between U.S. oil companies like UNOCAL and Halliburton and Taliban representatives dating back to 1996, the same year the Khobar Towers were bombed by the Taliban’s Al Qaeda wards. Although those negotiations ceased after the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa, they began again in earnest after George W. Bush became president. O’Neill had discovered that some of his Al Qaeda targets were involved in some very un-Islamic fundamentalist activities, including drug smuggling, teenage prostitution, and blood diamond dealing. The financial trail led O’Neill to a network of bank accounts in London, Dubai, the Isle of Man, Guernsey, and Jersey. The network investigated coincided exactly with the activities being carried out by the Russian-Israeli Mafia and its links to diamond, drug, and weapons dealers that was especially active in New York and Florida. The future 911 hijackers and their Israeli “shadows” had more than living in the same neighborhoods and frequenting the same bars, video rental stores, and rental mailbox stores in common. _________ On October 12, 2000, the USS Cole, docked in Aden harbor after the U.S. Navy deemed the port safe and certified it as a Defense Fuel Support Point, was reportedly blown up by two men who approached the warship in a small boat. The men were said to be Al Qaeda members from the bin Laden family homeland in Hadhramaut, a remote region in the east of Yemen straddling the Yemeni-Saudi border. Later, groups called the Army of Mohammed and the Army of Aden-Abyan claimed responsibility for the attack but these claims were reported through obscure sources in London. Former Ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodine O’Neill and his FBI soon arrived in Yemen to investigate the crime. From the outset, O’Neill received a cold shoulder from the U.S. ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodine (the Deputy Chief of Mission in Kuwait before Desert Storm, and the U.S. viceroy for central Iraq after the U.S. occupation). Bodine’s orders to limit the scope of O’Neill’s investigation came from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose father Dr. Joseph Korbel, a neo-con anti-Soviet professor, was the mentor for one of his students at the University of Denver – Condoleeezza Rice. O’Neill was not permitted to interview Yemenis who witnessed the Cole explosion. O’Neill was not permitted to examine the hat worn by one of the bombers in the boat nor was he allowed to examine the harbor sludge for evidence. O’Neill was soon pulled out of Yemen and Bodine refused him and his team permission to re-enter the country. O’Neill was getting too close to something. In February 2001, after Yemen’s Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab made a statement that there was no evidence linking the Cole bombing to al Qaeda (“Investigations have not so far proved, either to us or to the Americans, any link between Osama bin Laden and the Cole bombing.”), the Bush administration showed no desire to find out who actually bombed the ship. They were too busy clearing the baffles for the Iraq invasion and their other agendas. In early 2001, rumors began circulating that O’Neill would take over White House Counter-terrorism coordinator Richard Clarke’s job at the National Security Council. Clarke had been one of the few holdovers from the Clinton to Bush administrations. Suddenly, the story about the 90 minute theft of O’Neill’s brief case was leaked to the New York Times, even though the Justice Department had long before dropped its own investigation of the incident. Although the FBI continued its own investigation of the brief case incident, it prevented an investigation of the leak of the O’Neill incident to the media. On August 22, O’Neill retired from 30 years’ service with the FBI. The next day, he began his job as Security Director for the World Trade Center. His office was on the 34th Floor of the North Tower of the Trade Center. O’NEILL’S BUILDING WAS THE FIRST ONE HIT ON SEPTEMBER 11.

We are mapping out, using Google Earth, some of the incidents involved in presenting a rational response to the cover up, both the government version and the amateur “aftermarket” B-grade version. If you haven’t watched the entire video, please do that now. George Washington Bridge All major roadways in and out of New York were to be destroyed on 9/11. It was these teams, brought in from Israel that included the Mohammed Atta group, confirmed as directly tied to both the CIA and Egyptian intelligence, that were under surveillance by a combined task force that coordinated with local law enforcement. So, when thousands of pounds of explosives were placed inside the cable anchorage, teams were dispatched to disable these devices as soon as the attack at the World Trade Center began. George Washington Bridge New Jersey Cable Anchorage where thousands of pounds of high explosives were defused and recovered Simultaneous to the cutting of the cables, a massive truck bomb, as described in CBS and CNN news reports and police radio intercepts, was to explode (as heard, police reported this truck did explode), taking down the roadway supports, thus dropping the bridge “like a rock,” into the Hudson River. Roadway supports, George Washington Bridge The Tunnels Both the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels were to be demolished. We have only one arrest confirmation from the Manhattan side. NYPD roadblocks at the Lincoln Tunnel chased down a van that did a quick turn-around to avoid arrest. Two suspects were arrested with weapons and a truck filled with explosives. Police commissioner Bernie Kerik, recently released from prison, was on the scene with his personal Counter Terrorism Squad to take custody. They were never seen since. NYPD road block captures team 2 here with explosives filled truck on 9/11 Fort Lee Fort Lee is the real staging ground for 9/11. It was chosen for a good reason. News reports from 9/11 have been eliminated from archives, lists of terrorists caught then released at the orders of New York City and White House officials and flown out of the country are gone. Police who made the arrests, recorded above, are under gag order. Moreover, a vast support network involved in the preparation, planning and support of the 9/11 attacks, including the many unsuccessful attacks, not only are enjoying their freedom, some are among the most powerful Americans. As stated, 9/11 begins in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The “condo and co-op” community there is the home of one of the largest and most politically powerful “Israeli first” groups in America including key members of the notorious organization, JINSA, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, reputed to be more influential than PNAC (Project for a New American Century) and far more militant. An examination of JINSA shows it to be organized in cells like a terror group. Is it a surprise that the George Washington Bridge, Fort Lee’s primary landmark and the “view” sought by the residents of the highrises chosen for planting the radio jammers, was scheduled for a dramatic demolition on 9/11 with hundreds of commuter vehicles slated for the bottom of the Hudson River? Fort Lee Mafia Since the 1930s, Fort Lee has been a “mob town,” with the beginnings of “Murder Inc” and the Albert Anastasia gang and Joe Adonis. It all began when New York Mayor LaGuardia threw the mob out of New York. The new George Washington Bridge provided a home for the mob in Fort Lee with gambling clubs lining the Palisades on both sides of the GW Bridge. The famous Riviera Night Club as seen from the George Washington Bridge The fall of communism saw Russian/Ukranian organized crime come to New Jersey, settling in Fort Lee (see Appendix I). The The Taiwanchik-Trincher group is an amalgamation of Israeli/Ukrainian/Cypriot gangs operating illegal gambling operations throughout the United States with ties to the Romney/Bain financial group. From an indictment in Manhattan federal court: “THE TAIWANCHIK-TRINCHER ORGANIZATION (THE “ORGANIZATION”) WAS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE WITH STRONG TIES TO RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. THE ENTERPRISE OPERATED A HIGH-STAKES, ILLEGAL SPORTS GAMBLING BUSINESS OUT OF NEW YORK CITY THAT CATERED PRIMARILY TO RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS LIVING IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. BETWEEN 2006 AND APRIL 2012, THE ENTERPRISE LAUNDERED APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THEIR GAMBLING OPERATION IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE THROUGH SHELL COMPANIES AND BANK ACCOUNTS IN CYPRUS; AND OF THIS $100 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SENT FROM CYPRUS INTO THE UNITED STATES. ONCE THE MONEY HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, IT WAS EITHER LAUNDERED THROUGH ADDITIONAL SHELL COMPANIES OR INVESTED IN LEGITIMATE INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE.

Cooperation with local condo/co-op security assuring unfettered access to rooftops The Able Danger investigation, years later, staff gutted by Clinton blackmail cutbacks, tracked a major terror operation to Fort Lee, New Jersey. There they found the CIA, Mossad and Saudi Intelligence pulling together operational teams, moving vans, “art students” and even a few “dancing Israelis”… Mossad Safe House Where Feds Say 9/11 Was Planned The “dancer/art student” groups had a variety of tasks on 9/11, among them: Planting jammers on buildings on exhibit one to block Port Authority dispatchers and first responder radios Plant explosives on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge where the cables are anchored, in order to collapse the bridge Explode a truck in the Lincoln Tunnel Explode a truck in the Holland Tunnel Park trucks with demolition devices in specific parking areas of the twin towers Coordinate with Mohammed Atta and his group Of the 3 jammers locations shown below, two of those planted were recovered by the FCC and are held in evidence in Houston, Texas awaiting the “waiting until hell freezes over” Grand Jury to reconvene on Able Danger and 9/11. FBI Sat Across the Street, All 9/11 Planning on audio and video yet suppressed Many remember the stories about how fire department radios didn’t work and how new radios would have taken care of the problem. This is the real reason for the radio problems. The locations on this map were supplied by Jeff Smith who worked at the surveillance safe house and at the FBI office shown above. The safe house on Tom Hunter road was strategically placed to keep track of the Mossad “art student” rental further up Tom Hunter Road and across the street. Mohammed Atta’s “crash pad” 5 minutes walk from his handlers Mohammed Atta lived at 215 Main, four blocks over, within easy walking distance of the Israeli facility, the jammer targets and the bridge. He was across the parking lot from the Port Authority (220 Bruce Reynolds Road) which was within a “golf shot” of the FBI investigation offices. Jammer high rises as seen from FBI/Able Danger Parking lot The real purpose of the 9/11 attack was much more than taking down the World Trade Center. Imagine New York City, the WTC “evaporated,” the George Washington Bridge sitting in the Hudson, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels flooded, hundreds drowned and the city entirely cut off and in full panic mode while police and fire radios were jammed. Were other attacks on Washington foiled as well? The White House or Capitol Building targets? Could martial law have been declared? Worse? In the end we got the Department of Homeland Security. This reminds me of the Len Deighton book, SSGB, a fictional tale of Britain’s Scotland Yard, working for the German SS after Hitler’s successful invasion of the UK. We got the DHS after losing a war with AIPAC. You just can’t make this stuff up! VT requests that the officers who arrested the Israeli “suspects” with the “thousands of pounds of explosives” (CNN) or who were captured “as the van exploded” come forward. We also ask that all the witnesses of the 2nd plane that was allowed to fly out of the US that day come forward, to confirm that it carried the “exiting” Israeli team, encluding the above mentioned ones who were caught. We know who authorized the plane to leave, a key aspect of the operation, including the NY City law enforcement officials the performed some magic tricks that day.

Submitted by Heinz Pommer with Jeff Prager to Veterans Today Introduction by Gordon Duff with Ian Greenhalgh and Jeff Smith (Nuclear weapons designer/particle physicist) The material here is overwhelming, hours of lectures and dozens of detailed slides. This is not an easy read. It is another piece of irrevocable proof regarding 9/11 and the use of nuclear weapons and, on its own, worth much more than just scanning or flipping through. * Architects and engineers say planes don’t knock down skyscrapers. Nuclear physicists say only atomic bombs can turn out this kind of heat and damage. The real investigators who were silenced by a grand jury and a wealth of threats said it was a conspiracy and named lots of names, some expected, some not. Now an independent physicist has proven the work done by the original investigators who were silenced and much new work as well. His modeling and detail is breathtaking. We were recently introduced to the work of Germany physicist Heinz Pommer. I chose to contact him. His work deeply parallels work done by the US Department of Energy and IAEA which was censored and suppressed so that the fake 9/11 report could be published and blame put on Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike Pommer’s work (aided by Jeff Prager), the VT team included some of those involved in the ill fated original investigation. Working from different data, to an extent, both teams have ended up with nearly identical results. https://www.veteranstoday.com/2018/09/25/the-secret-history-of-9-11/ VT knows the who, how and when from official sources. Pommer (and Prager), however, have taken their portion a step further and have produced what the original team would have presented to congress and the president, had they been allowed, of the proofs of nuclear weapons and their effects. Their work is identical to the secret work by the DOE and Sandia National Labs but adds much as well. Included are video presentations sent by Pommer to me and his PDF slides. This material has been submitted to the US team and we will get their comments. 6.3 Demon’s trap 9/11 Your mind is not your consciousness. Your consciousness is your state or quality of awareness of your existence, of being a person. Your mind, however, can be hijacked and controlled. Your thoughts can be guided to this and that, and finally your mind might simply play the role of an uneducated dog. It barks a lot: “be aware, intruders!” If your mind is bent the right way (in the sense of the perpetrators of 9/11) you will accept nothing except the fairy tale of Osama bin Laden. Then your mind and your thoughts will clutch and grasp to the last straws, in order to save your world view. It will accept nothing, least of all an offending truth. Truth, however, is important. So, lets start this subchapter rendering homage to one great defender of the truth, Saint Augustine of Hippo. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD) Saint Augustine of Hippo from Numidia (a Roman province on the North African Coast) was in a certain sense an extremist, whose position could be condensed in the phrase: “Better to fall with the truth than to stand with the lie.” He knew Rome well, as he would recognize Rome in modern western society in his splendor and cruelty. Victory at all costs. The truth does not matter, the triumph of the lie is omnipresent and masked – if at all – by the cosy word “illusion”. To understand the essence of truth – love of God’s creation by all beings – he also studied the lie, defining how these two antipodes reveal themselves in human society. The next pages show 25 steps in which the destruction process of the South Tower and the processes in the ground are sketched. These sketches did offend many people and were harshly criticized as “fantasy sketches”, or even as a “dangerous effort to deceive the public”. However, these sketches should be regarded only as a playful approach in an effort to understand a physical process and to calculate a more precise model afterwards. They don’t pretend being “The Truth”. For a conscious person, there is nothing offensive in them. Even if your mind tells you so.

It provided an additional 4.6 billion dollars in funding for its mission. https://www.911healthwatch.org/history/votes/congressional-record/ The bill (9/11 Victims Compensation Fund reauthorization 2019, until … 2090) According to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, paying out the outstanding claims and future claims would cost $10.2 billion over the next decade. The bill does not appropriate a specific amount of money to process victims’ compensation claims, instead appropriating “such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2019 and each fiscal year thereafter through fiscal year 2090.” https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/12/9-11-victims-compensation-fund-house-votes-reauthorize-fund/1712818001/ Loading...

    "articleText": "Boris Johnson, a leadership candidate for Britain's Conservative Party, talks during a hustings event in Birmingham, Britain, June 22, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah McKay Yet another delay! My long-suffering country won’t be breaking free from the Evil Empire on Thursday as planned. The good news is that there’s likely to be a General Election in Britain on either December 9th or 12th and the EU are split on how long to extend our membership beyond Thursday. The Hungarians and the Poles have sold us out – the bastards – but the French, of all people, are holding out for a shorter delay. The other bit of good news of course is the whacking of ISIS terrorist bigwig al-Baghdadi, no doubt a Remainer. The French stance makes some sort of sense, if you’re French, that is. They don’t believe in free trade and are worried that the EU’s stance towards a free trade deal has shifted since Theresa May was forced out, helped by a little intel analysis from yours truly. Whereas May’s Withdrawal Agreement was intended to be a permanent agreement, with no trade deal to follow, Boris’s agreement is time limited. The EU has therefore changed its stance towards a follow-up agreement. There is no doubt that Boris’s agreement is better than May’s. It still comes with a price tag of between £300 and £800 billion however, potentially more if it leads to a continuation of free movement. That’s because full EU membership costs around £250 billion a year, mostly made up of regulatory and labor displacement costs. Most of those costs would continue to apply under Boris’s deal, which could be extended until the end of 2022. The numbers are so bad that no one in the government or Civil Service dare cost the agreement. The French are torn between wanting to damage the UK economy by inflicting Boris’s deal on us and the damage that might be done to their economy if Jerry throws them under a bus and agrees a free trade deal. Jerry of course wants to continue dumping Mercedes-Benz’s and BMWs on the British market at inflated prices. We’ll know the date the EU wants to impose on us by tomorrow or Tuesday, or maybe Wednesday. It’s interesting that the French have held out – normally the cheese-eating surrender monkeys, no offense intended, would have caved in to Berlin long before now. Presidents of the Vichyist Fifth Republic normally behave as though the Wehrmacht still occupied France, not like Corporal LeBeau in Hogan’s Heroes. The trade deficit with the EU BBC’s Question Time, which has been going for 40 years and was originally moderated by that nice man Robin Day, is a TV program where the audience ask sensible questions and a panel of five fail to answer them. One of the panelists on Thursday night was Lord Lamont, the man who brought us Black Wednesday. An economically illiterate former Chancellor of the Exchequer, if that is not a tautology, His Lordship argued that free trade with the EU was essential because they’re our major trading partner and absorb about half of our exports. There are four problems with that: (1) You guys are our major trading partner and buy more of our goods than any EU country. Rolling up all the EU member states together is cheating – the Commonwealth states, combined, are just as important, if not more. (2) The Cabinet Office and the Treasury continue to rig the export statistics. Under the Rotterdam/Antwerp Fraud all exports via the Netherlands and Belgium are counted as exports to those countries, even if they’re destined for China or South Korea. (3) Under EU rules designed to magnify the economic importance of the EU exports to EU member states are calculated differently to exports to the rest of the world, using VAT returns. The true figure for exports to the EU, excluding the Republic of Ireland, is about 30%, and (4) Such trade in goods as we do with EU member states is at a massive deficit, likely to be about £100 billion this year. Do the math! Norman Lamont can’t – he’s a politician, no offense intended. Tariffs will protect British industry from predatory European, mostly German, importers. As the prices of Mercedes and BMWs go up so home sales of Jaguar Land Rover will rise. It’s called import substitution. Profits on home sales will also be slightly higher, as less admin is involved. Exporting to the EU requires reams of paperwork. I export to the EU! I was paid expenses for giving a speech in Dublin in 2017. The last bit of VAT paperwork was sorted a month ago, two years after the speech! Of course I would never be able to make these points on Question Time. There’s a Cabinet Office ban on my appearing on BBC TV and has been since the end of 1999, when they ordered the BBC to cancel an appearance on BBC News 24. Question Time also operate a glass ceiling – they like panelists to be reasonably intelligent and articulate, but there’s no way they would ever have a panelist with an IQ above 175. The risk of well-informed, intelligent answers would simply be too great. The Cabinet Secretary Boris Johnson’s decision not to sack the Cabinet Secretary, Ritter Mark ‘von’ Sedwill, in July was the worst decision since Bill Edrich got out hooking before he had played himself in, in the Second Test against Australia at Lord’s in 1938. A fanatical Remainer (Sedwill, not Edrich, who was a war hero and won the DFC), he’s committed to this mad plan of Boris’s. One solution would be to execute Sedwill, nicely of course. Whilst I approve of the decision to execute Sedwill’s notorious predecessor, Jeremy ‘von’ Heywood (Germany’s top agent in Whitehall), on moral grounds, it involved violations, albeit technical, of the Homicide Act. Whilst it is pleasing to note that he died in pain, he was given pain relief and did not die horribly enough. Hesitant though I am to criticise colleagues in the Intelligence Community, who were only doing their best to protect the national interest, Heywood’s execution also lacked style. The United Kingdom is the only EU Member State to retain the death penalty. It can’t be imposed by the ordinary courts, but remains available, by means of an Act of Attainder, to the High Court of Parliament. Since the verdict and sentence take the form of an Act of Parliament the Human Rights Act has no application. executioner with axe The sight of Mark Sedwill being dragged in mortal terror to the scaffold at the Tower of London would send a suitable signal to our community partners. It would also make splendid television, with the sale of the broadcasting rights more than covering the executioner’s fee. Other key Remainers could follow him to the block. Of course it would need a patriotic House of Commons, but that’s on the cards. All Boris has to do to win a Brexit majority is to abandon his obsession with doing a deal with the EU and cut a deal with that nice man Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party instead. Boris’s decision to let the Benn Act go through means that in order to win a majority he has to work with the Brexit Party. If he doesn’t he’ll probably end up leading a minority government again. Al-Baghdadi It’s wonderful news that al-Baggers has finally fallen off his perch. He is now an ex-terrorist, thankfully, although it’s sad news about the wounded pooch. Congratulations are due to the Administration and US Special Forces. President Trump, with respect, does not share my fault of excessive modesty (I’m working on it!), but he was gracious enough to pay frank tribute to the US service personnel involved. The counter-intelligence effort was impressive. When we were going after the DVD’s Saddam Hussein and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi the Bad Guys were constantly warned via Dachau. Neither could be captured until we had attended to the plumbing. Al-Baghdadi no doubt thought we was safe. Somebody did some good work, somewhere. I hope that the leakers of previous plans to capture or kill al-Baghdadi will be dealt with. Extra dog biscuits for the dogs, I think! There’s been no word yet about the dog which was wounded in the line of duty. Hopefully it will receive the very best of veterinary care and will be restored to health. It would be nice to see it receive the Dickin Medal, the ‘animal VC’. There is precedent for awarding this prestigious medal to animals serving with non-British Empire or Commonwealth forces. Chips, a Husky, was awarded the medal, posthumously of course, in 2018, appropriately enough for service with the US Army during Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily) in 1943. The triumph should take the heat off the President over this Ukraine nonsense. The whole Ukraine thing smacks of the Deep State, the German Deep State, that is. The mainstream media are fawning over retired ambassadors and suchlike, but the idea of a career diplomat being neutral re President Trump only has to be stated for its absurdity to be apparent. The reality is that the Democrats have never gotten over their defeat in 2016 and in non-eponymous fashion reject the result. They’ll make up any old nonsense in order to remove the President. The Russian hoax failed, so now they and their allies in the CIA have come up with a Ukrainian hoax. It’s a double-edged sword, given Vice-President Biden’s role in getting an overpaid job for his son Hunter and ‘von’ Obama’s role in swinging huge amounts of aid to the Ukraine, a corrupt German puppet state. The only scandal here is how Hunter Biden got a seat on the board of Burisma in April 2014, when he couldn’t even speak Ukrainian. I note that Joseph Cofer Black, the failed former counter-terrorism czar at the CIA, who sat back fat dumb and happy whilst al-Qaeda terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11, is another dubious appointment to the Burisma Board, no offense intended. Staying with Cofer, it would be interesting to know from where this clown got the intelligence which nailed the DVD’s Carlos the Jackal. The Sacoolas Scandal This is continuing to do damage to Anglo-American relations, although President Trump’s gracious decision to invite Harry Dunn’s grieving parents to the White House did him credit. I thought his parents made a mistake in not agreeing to meet Sacoolas. It was the only chance they’ll ever get. It’s looking increasingly as though the Correa/COREA Group were involved. If so there is no way that Sacoolas would ever be returned to the UK for trial. Northamptonshire Police’s idiot Chief Constable, if that is not a tautology, with respect, is misleading the public by claiming that the decision whether or not to prosecute will be taken independently. Whether he knows it or not, the decision will be taken in the Cabinet Office, which controls the Crown Prosecution Service. So far as I know there isn’t a single Crown Prosecutor in England with the guts and the integrity to stand up to the Cabinet Office. Sacoolas won’t be extradited, although Harry’s parents may win a wrongful death suit against her. She probably wouldn’t pay the damages however. Since the CIA and the State Department are anti-British they won’t mind the damage this shameful incident is causing. As a courtesy I shall be forwarding a copy of this column to the family’s able spokesman, Radd Seiger. The Foreign Office aren’t coming out of this any better than Northamptonshire’s useless police force. No one has yet explained why the FCO chose to lie Harry’s parents and suggest that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity when clearly she didn’t. Illegal Migrant Deaths On Wednesday morning 39 illegal migrants were discovered dead inside a refrigerated truck-hauled container in Grays Essex. Even for Essex this was an unusually large number of dead bodies to be found inside one vehicle. We know they were illegals because none had valid travel documents and each had evaded immigration controls at Zeebrugge, their port of departure, assuming of course that they were alive when they left. Initially reported to be ‘Chinese’ many of the victims turn out to have come from Ha Tinh province in Vietnam, although they may have been trafficked through China. If they were it was probably with the connivance of the Chinese authorities, who are used to working with organised crime. Apparently the illegals flew from China to an airport in the EU. How do you get onto a plane in totalitarian China without valid travel documents? Security at Chinese airports simply isn’t that lax. It’s unclear when the victims died, victims in the sense that they were murdered. They were of course participating willingly in an illegal enterprise, conspiracy to evade immigration controls, that is to say they died in the course of committing a crime. Each of the victims appears to have been above the age of criminal responsibility in England. It looks as they died between leaving Zeebrugge and arriving at Purfleet. If that is right it begs the question of why the truck driver, Mo Robinson, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter. I’m not sure if the CPS realise this, but in order to be guilty of homicide you have to cause a death. Picking up a container load of dead bodies may be an immigration offence, if your original intent was to help the deceased evade immigration control, but manslaughter it ain’t. Whoever sealed the container, knowing it was refrigerated, committed murder, unless they had reason to believe that the container would be opened before the illegals froze to death. Robinson, to his credit, called the Ambulance Service, a humanitarian act inconsistent with the requisite mens rea for manslaughter. As usual the police seem to be going for the small fry. The National Crime Agency, whose role, as its name implies, is to promote crime, is making sure that the big shots escape justice. Since the NCA reports to the Cabinet Office and most human trafficking into the UK is overseen by GO2, the DVD’s London operation, that makes sense. The victims are part of the human cost of Britain’s disastrous EU membership. Without ‘free movement of people’ in the EU these people would not have been trafficked. The lack of immigration controls at Zeebrugge and Purfleet is a direct consequence of EU membership. As usual the left are going bananas. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott takes the prize for the silliest response, on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show this morning. She opined that the death toll might be reduced in future if we stayed inside the EU, because we would retain access to their databases. They were illegals, Diane! They weren’t on any database, and even if they were it wouldn’t be in their real names. Rugby World Cup Well played England! A superb performance yesterday saw them hammer the mighty All-Blacks (this is not a reference to Justin Trudeau) 19 points to 7 in the semi-final in Yokohama. This was England’s biggest win in Japan since HMS King George V bombarded Hamamatsu in 1945. HMS King George V It was also arguably England’s finest win over the Kiwis since we beat them 13 to nil at Twickers in 1936, with the help of two fine tries by White Russian Prince Alexander Obolensky, a first class chap. You wouldn’t catch him voting Remain! That scoreline, by the way, ought to have given the Nazis pause for thought before starting World War II. My Reading this week This has included Open Cockpit (1969, Jarrolds) by Air-Vice Marshal Arthur Gould Lee. It tells the story of his adventures as a fighter pilot on Sopwith Pups and Camels in World War I. (For the benefit of non-aviation minded readers a Camel in the context of World War I air combat was not a dromedary.) Captain Lee, as he then was, was a good shot and a fine pilot, who bagged more Huns than Snoopy. His book is well worth a read. I’m pleased to say that it’s been reprinted by those nice people at Grub Street and is readily available for those with an interest in aviation history. One incident caught my eye in particular. Having been forced down in No Man’s Land Arthur Lee made his way to our lines, where he was caught in a gas attack. He had a mask, and survived, but the horses didn’t. How can we possibly do a deal with a nation which gases horses? The dastardly Hun is not known as the dastardly Hun for nothing. Loading...

    "articleText": "Andre Vltchek …with New Eastern Outlook, Moscow, est. 1816 [ Editor’s Note: I had expected the wandering Andre to be making a stop in Beirut, as he has the travel budget that is the envy of us all. Life on the road is a hard one. You have to love it, or it will devour you. I have only been in Lebanon while passing through to Syria, so I only had glimpses of it all. I was lucky on my first trip, going to the Syrian election as a monitor in 2014, to have been in Beirut for a weekend. My experienced host wisely suggested that I needed to see the city from street level, which was hard to do in the traffic-packed city. But he offered to get up at 6:30 on a Sunday morning to give me a motor scooter tour while traffic was light the only time of the week that is was. Jim Dean at the Sabra and Shatilla Camp massacre monument – June 2014 – Photo by Franklin Lamb It was just wonderful, the sights, sounds, smells, the early morning markets, a city like I had never seen before. The sad part was the begging Palestinian kids, very aggressive. I feared for the hate that would blossom in them someday. On the next trip with the VT crew for the Damascus Counter-terrorism conference, we had two days in Lebanon on the way home. Despite still being down with the E. coli poisoning, the doctors had given us meds to at least be able to ride in a van, so we got out to the infamous Bekaa valley, where the drugs are grown in the good land there. The Baalbek Roman ruins were wonderful, and we got loads of photos and videos, but they were not 4K like we have now. It was a rare, once in a lifetime trip, and a treat before the months of treatment getting over the E. coli thanks to my board-certified Afghan doctor, in Atlanta of all places. Andre Vltchek has seen the exploitation by the rich all over the world, and he knows how to tell the story, so I will let him get on with the sad state of affairs in Lebanon. But that said, for what is available for them to steal in Lebanon is peanuts compared to big business looting on the international scale. The theft is done by the political parties to fund campaigns as there no donations rolling in from the average people. Notice how the crowd looks to be 100% young people, devoid of middle aged folks and also anyone in the religious garb normally seen all over Beirut. May the tough Lebanese find some way to get through it all… Jim W.

Temple of Baalbeck in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon – First published … October 24, 2019 – Tires are burning, smoke is rising towards the sky. It is October, the 18th day of the month, the capital city of Lebanon, in the past known as the “Paris of the East”, is covered in smoke. For years I was warning that the country governed by corrupt, indifferent elites, could not hold together, indefinitely. For all those five years when I was calling Beirut home, things were going down the drain. Nothing was improving: almost no public transportation, electricity shortages, contaminated and erratic water supply. Periodically, garbage has been piling up along the streets and suburban roads. Once an airplane lands and the doors open, the terrible stench of garbage welcomes us, residents of Beirut, back home. Almost everyone knew that all this could not continue like this, forever. The city was suffering from 4th World diseases, while simultaneously being flooded with Land Rover SUVs, Maserati and Porsche sports cars, and Armani suits. Beirut has almost collapsed to Jakarta levels, although, one has to admit, with extremely smart, highly educated and sophisticated elites, capable of conversing simultaneously in three world languages: French, Arabic and English. Also, with first rate art galleries, art cinemas, posh bars and nightclubs. With lavish marinas and the best bookstores in the entire Middle East. Some say that Beirut has always been in possession of brain and guts, but something happened to its heart. Now nothing really works here. But if you have millions of dollars, it does not really matter; you can buy anything here. If you are poor, destitute – abandon all hope. And the majority of the people here are now miserably poor. And no one even knows precisely how many are destitute, as a census is forbidden, in order ‘not to disturb religious balance’ (it was, for years, somehow agreed on, that it is better not to know how many Christians or Muslims are residing in the country). It is certain that most of people are not rich. And now, outraged by their rulers, corrupt politicians and so-called elites, they are shouting, loudly and clearly: “Enough!”, Halas, down with the regime!” *** The government decided to impose a tax on WhatsApp calls. Not a big deal, some would say. But it was; it is, it suddenly became a big deal. “The last drop”, perhaps. The city exploded. Barricades were erected. Tires were set on fire. Everywhere: in the poorest as well as in the richest neighborhoods. “Revolution!” people began shouting. Lebanon has a history of left-wing, even Communist insurgencies. It also has its fair share of religious, right-wing fanaticism. Which one will win? Which one will be decisive, during this national rebellion? The Communist Party is now behind several marches. But Hezbollah, until now the most solid social force in the country, is not yet convinced that the government of Saad al Hariri, should simply resign. According to Reuters: “Lebanon’s Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said… that the group was not demanding the government’s resignation amid widespread national protests. Nasrallah said in a televised speech that he supported the government, but called for a new agenda and “new spirit,” adding that ongoing protests showed the way forward was not new taxes.” Any tax imposed on the poor would push him to call supporters to go take to the streets, Nasrallah added.” So far, the rebellion has left countless people injured, while two Syrian immigrants lost their lives. Some local analysts say that this is the most serious uprising since the one in 2015 (which included the “You Stink!” campaign, reacting to the appalling garbage crises in Beirut and to the worsening social disaster), but others, including this author, are convinced that this is actually the most serious political catastrophe Lebanon has been facing since the 1980’s. One hears anger, on every corner of the capital, in cafes and local stores: “Trust is broken!” Even those who used to be far from any political activities, are now supporting protesters. Ms. Jehan, a local staff member at a UN office in Beirut, is one of those who found herself on the side of the rebellion: “What is happening to Beirut and all over in Lebanon is good. It is about time we stood up. I will go too. This has nothing to do with religions. It is about our shattered lives.” *** Reading Western mainstream media, one could begin to believe that Lebanon’s main problems are issues like foreign debt (Lebanon is, on a per capita basis, the third most indebted country on earth. The debt stands at 150% of its GDP), miniscule real reserves (US$ 10 billion), and the way the country interacts with the donors and lenders. IMF and its “advice” are constantly mentioned. But even news agencies like Reuters have to admit that the entire mess is far from just about structural problems: “As dollars have dried up, banks have effectively stopped lending and can no longer make basic foreign-exchange transactions for clients, one banker said.” ““The whole role of banks is to pour money into the central bank to finance the government and protect the currency,” he said. “Nothing is being done on the fiscal deficit because doing something will disrupt the systems of corruption.”” And here is the key word: “Corruption!” Lebanon’s elites are shamelessly corrupt. Only such countries like Indonesia are able to compete with the Lebanese troglodyte clans, when it comes to stripping the entire nation of its riches. Almost nothing is clean, or pure in Lebanon, and that is also why there aren’t any statistics available. Money comes from the monstrous and ruthless exploitation of natural resources in West Africa. Everybody knows it, but it is never addressed, publicly. I worked in West Africa, and I know what the racist Lebanese ‘business people’ are doing there. But money stolen from the Africans does not enrich Lebanon and its people. It ends up in the Lebanese banks, and spent on lavish yachts, tacky and overpriced European sports cars, and inside bizarre private clubs in and around the capital. While many Lebanese people are near starvation, airplanes flying to Nice, Venice or Greek Islands are constantly packed with la dolce vita seekers. Lebanon makes billions of dollars from narcotics, particularly those cultivated and refined in the Beqaa Valley. They get exported mainly to Saudi Arabia, for the consumption of the rich, or injected into the battlefields in Yemen and Syria, so-called combat drugs. Again, everyone knows it, but nothing is done to stop it. Hundreds of families, from farmers to politicians, got filthy rich on that trade. This adds a few more super-yachts at the proverbial Beirut marinas. Then, there is ‘foreign aid’, ‘European investment into infrastructure’, Saudi and Qatari money. Most of it goes, directly, into the pockets of corrupt officials, to the so-called ‘government’, and to its buddies, contractors. Almost nothing is built, but the money is gone. Lebanon has railroad employees who are getting their monthly paychecks, but no railways, anymore. Train station had been converted into vodka bar. Lebanon begs for money so it can host refugees from all over the region, but much of the money ends up in a few deep pockets. Very little goes to the refugees themselves, or to the poor Lebanese people who have to compete for low-paying jobs with the desperate Syrians or Palestinians. The poor are getting poorer. Yet, Ethiopian, Philippine and Kenyan maids are dragging the groceries of the rich, wiping spit off the faces of babies born into elite families, and cleaning toilets. Some get tortured by their masters, many commit suicide. Lebanon is a tough place, for those who do not look Phoenician or European. And the slums in the south of Beirut are growing. And some Lebanese cities, like Tripoli in the north, look like tremendous slums, altogether. Ali, a receptionist at a hotel in downtown Beirut laments: “I work here as a receptionist for 14 hours and earn only 540 USD every month. I need a minimum of 700 USD to survive. I have a sister in US and want to visit her only for a week, but there is no way I can get visa. I am only 24 years old. I see no future in this country, like so many thousand others protesting in the streets of Beirut.” According to various estimates, Lebanon may collapse as early as in February 2020. No more money can be looted. The end game is approaching. If it does collapse, the rich will have their golden parachutes. They have their families abroad: in Australia, Brazil, France. Some have two passports, others have houses in the most desirable parts of the world. The poor will be left with absolutely nothing: with a carcass of a country, previously looted by its own elites. There will be rotting, ageing Ferraris, all over, but one cannot eat carcasses of cars. There will be lavish but abandoned swimming pools, right next to polluted and destroyed beaches. People know it, and they have had enough. Mohamed, a worker at a Starbucks cafe in Beirut is determined: “This is terrible but it is about time. We can take no more. We need to change the country, drastically. This time things are different. Not about who we worship but about our daily lives.” Lebanon, in comparison to other shamelessly-capitalist countries, is well-educated. People here cannot be fooled. The rebellion against the elites has just begun. People want to take back their country. Andre Vltchek is philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist.

ROBERT STEELE: I have intuited from a number of sources that the Seth Rich murder is now central to the criminal investigation. At the demand of the Attorney General NSA is reported to have mapped all of Seth Rich’s calls and emails and texts, and to have unmasked all US citizens contained in that map (this is legal, and the counterpart to Susan Rice’s ordering the unmasking of all US citizens associated with candidate Donald Trump’s campaign, actions that were illegal and tantamount to treason). If Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi are not wearing diapers already, this would be a good time to them to start. UPDATE 3: Story makes Stillness in the Storm & Zero Hedge — EPIC! Stillness in the Storm: Michael Flynn On Verge of Vindication As Deep State In Full Panic If Powell can indeed vindicate and exonerate Michael Flynn, the floodgates will fly open. Flynn would then have the ability to become the Director of National Intelligence, which according to former CIA spy Robert David Steele, would pave the way for Flynn to “terminate mass surveillance and [illegal] regime change covert operations including domestic false flag operations AND start providing the President with 100% of the decision support he needs instead of the 4% he is getting now.” Assange’s most trusted personal contact is said to be in touch with US officials about remediating the lies that have been told President Donald Trump to make him fear Julian Assange, and about getting William Barr to fly to London to meet with Assange personally, offer him a pardon and complete protection, and bring him back to the USA, out of the control of MI-5 and MI-6 that appear to be “frying” Assange’s brain and are perfectly capable of assassinating Assange while he is in captivity. Robert David Steele, who gifted Assange his Marine Corps codeword box while visiting London, says this: “Assange is priceless to our President, and easily a ‘castle’ on the 4D chessboard. Assange is the stake that our President could drive into the heart of the Deep State that uses British and American intelligence agencies as their dirty jobbers.” ZERO HEDGE: FBI Entrapped Flynn With Manipulated Evidence As Clapper Allegedly Issued ‘Kill Shot’ Order: Court Docs At the heart of the matter is the 302 form ‘documenting’ an FBI interview in which Flynn was asked about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Powell alleges that FBI lawyer Lisa Page edited her lover Peter Strzok’s account of the interview – texting him, “I made your edits.” “The government knew that well in advance of Mr. Flynn’s plea that Judge Contreras was a friend of Peter Strzok and his recusal was even discussed in an exchange of multiple texts.” LOL. Barack Obama is going to love this interview his former DIA James Clapper just gave to CNN about the Durham probe: “It’s frankly disconcerting to be investigated for having done… what we were told to do by the president of the United States.” UPDATE 4: Ben Garrison cartoon immortalizes “Bull Durham” Re-Published with Permission. Visit Ben at https://grrrgraphics.com/. Ben Garrison @ Phi Beta Iota UPDATE 5: Brennan Task Force Exposed, Haspel Cooperating with Barr? Larry C. Johnson: Exposing John Brennan’s Secret CIA Trump Task Force? While a “Task Force” can be a useful tool for tackling issues of terrorism or drug trafficking, it is not appropriate or lawful for collecting on a U.S. candidate for the Presidency. But Brennan did it, so I’m told, and it had the blessing of the Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper. Brennan reportedly took it upon himself to recruit foreign intelligence organizations, such as MI-6, the Aussies, the Italians and the Israelis, to help in spying on Trump and his campaign. He sold it as a “counter-intelligence” mission citing his fear that Trump was a Russian puppet. And these foreign services agreed to help. But they did more than passive collection. They helped create and implement covert actions, such as entrapping Michael Flynn as a foreign agent and cultivating and ensnaring George Papadopoulos. I am also hearing that CIA Director Gina Haspel is cooperating. She was the CIA Chief of Station in London when this Task Force was up a running but my friend says she was kept out of the loop. She and Brennan have a history and it is not friendly. Brennan blocked her from getting a top assignment in what used to be known as the “Directorate of Operations.” So no love lost between the two. UPDATE 6: Manafort and Stone can prove FBI lies & illicit surveillance Robert David STEELE Vivas ROBERT STEELE: I am reliably informed that absolute proof of FBI lies and illicit surveillance has now been provided to the legal teams for Paul Manafort (against whom Ukrainian evidence was fabricated as well) and Roger Stone. Both of them should be able to gain dismissal on the same terms as Mike Flynn. While efforts continue to defame and discredit and marginalize individuals that have bootleg copies of documents that crucify the FBI and the Department of Justice, I believe that in the end, Flynn, Stone, and belatedly Manafort will be vindicated. This is not to say that Manafort will be excused for tax avoidance, only that he can reasonably claim gross misconduct on part of DoJ and FBI and seek remediation on that basis. Loading...

    "articleText": "In a previous article I mentioned that this Marine was facing deportation. Now it has actually happened. Yesterday he was deported to El Salvador, a country he has no memory of. I have received emails which said that the only reason I was supporting this young man was that he was an immigrant. This is totally false. This is only one of thousands of incidents where our government has simply discarded “used” soldiers. There are many thousands of veterans who are now living on our streets as homeless people. In this case the government had an “excuse” to simply deport him and make him someone else’s problem. What is different here is that in El Salvador there are gangs that target former US soldiers for murder. Since he has brain damage, he probably does not know how to defend himself or even that he is in danger. Our neglect of veterans is, unfortunately, nothing new. There are still a few remaining Viet Nam veterans who are still trying to get relief from their exposure to agent orange. Apparently DHS and ICE were trying to conceal their activities as they failed to inform his lawyer or family as is the regular procedure. Aris Folley 15 hrs ago Marine Corps Marine Corps vet who served in Iraq deported to El Salvador Segovia-Benitez’s attorney Roy Petty told the Phoenix New Times that he didn’t find out Segovia-Benitez had been deported until after he arrived for a planned meeting with his client at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Arizona where he was being held. “Certainly, this is a surprise,” he told the paper Wednesday. “ICE kept his deportation a secret. They kept it a secret from him, me, his other attorney, and they kept it a secret from his mother. It’s not common practice.” “Generally, what ICE will do is they will notify the person so the person can make arrangements. They woke him up and put him on a plane,” he continued. An ICE spokeswoman confirmed Segovia-Benitez’s deportation in a statement to The Hill on Wednesday. “Mr. Segovia-Benitez was removed to his home country Oct. 23 in accordance with federal law and the policies and procedures of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” she said. She also noted that shortly after an immigration judge ordered Segovia-Benitez’s removal, he “subsequently appealed his case with the Board of Immigration Appeals, which denied the appeal.” “He also filed two stay requests with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, both of which were denied,” she added. The report is the latest update in a high-profile deportation case that has garnered widespread attention in recent weeks. Segovia-Benitez served two tours in Iraq before he was honorably discharged in 2004, a year after he suffered a brain injury. The veteran also received a number of decorations for his service during his time in the military, according to NBC News. But after he was discharged from the military, Segovia-Benitez began to self-medicate with alcohol, his family said, which led to trouble with authorities. He ended up serving time in prison for a variety of crimes, including assault with a deadly weapon and injuring a spouse, for which he received an eight-year prison sentence. Segovia-Benitez’s family members have said that while they do not condone his criminal actions, they believe the government failed to provide adequate care for him after he was discharged. Brandee Dudzic, executive director of the group Repatriate our Patriots, told ABC News that Segovia-Benitez wasn’t diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder until 2011, seven years after he was discharged from the military. His lawyer told the Phoenix New Times that his team is still working on his case and hopes “that ICE will correct this problem and allow him to come back to fight his case.” “What would certainly be horrible would be if he were kidnapped or killed in El Salvador before that,” Petty said while expressing concern that Segovia-Benitez, who doesn’t speak Spanish fluently, could be targeted in El Salvador. “Gangs target former U.S. military,” he told the paper. “They’ll kidnap a person, they may hold a person for ransom, they may torture an individual.” dhs Loading...

I was shocked to see the public polls against withdrawal, also, including the peaceful Democrats. So what’s up with that?

Click to donate >> – First published … October 24, 2019 – The US is planning to deploy fresh troops and battle tanks to Syria’s northeastern oil fileds, Newsweek reported on October 23, citing an official in the Pentagon. The unnamed official told the magazine that the US is seeking to deploy a half of an US Army armored brigade combat team battalion that includes as many as 30 Abrams tanks alongside personnel to key oil fields in northeastern Syria. According to the official, the plan is pending White House approval. Northeastern Syria oil fields, including al-Rmelan and al-Omar, are controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The official said that these forces will continue to be involved in securing these oil fields, the official said. President Donald Trump had announced that the U.S. is going on with its plan to withdraw troops from northeast Syria. However, he said that oil fields in the region and the area of al-Tanaf in the southeastern part of the country will be kept under control as for now. When asked by Newsweek about the oil situation, one senior administration official said that the final fate of these resources was yet to be determined. “The President has stated that we are going to have a residual force in the region to protect areas that hold the oil fields, as well as the base down at al-Tanaf, in southern Syria. Those are important areas to allow us to constrain the resurgence of ISIS. And there is some artillery benefit, of course, to Kurds and other Democratic Forces being in control of the oil,” the official said. “As far as how the oil will be sold and that sort of thing, that’s something that we’ll certainly look into and we’ll monitor going forward. And we’ll keep a close eye on that.” The Pentagon has not commented on Newsweek’s report, so far. If approved, the deployment of such a large force would contradict the withdrawal process. By keeping oil fields under control, Washington is clearly working to prevent the Damascus government, which is engaged in a deal with the SDF, from recapturing vital resources. Loading...

    "articleText": "Once a good looking, articulate fast thinker, now “a shambling and incoherent wreck”. Who can feel comfortable after reading Craig Murray’s alarming account of Julian Assange’s appearance at Westminster Magistrates Court this week? Murray, a former UK ambassador and diplomat, is widely respected for his truth and accuracy. He reminds us: “The charge against Julian is very specific; conspiring with Chelsea Manning to publish the Iraq War logs, the Afghanistan war logs and the State Department cables. The charges are nothing to do with Sweden, nothing to do with sex, and nothing to do with the 2016 US election…. “The purpose of yesterday’s hearing was case management; to determine the timetable for the extradition proceedings. The key points at issue were that Julian’s defence was requesting more time to prepare their evidence; and arguing that political offences were specifically excluded from the extradition treaty. There should, they argued, therefore be a preliminary hearing to determine whether the extradition treaty applied at all.” He provides chapter and verse on Article 4 of the UK/US Extradition Treaty 2007. “On the face of it, what Assange is accused of is the very definition of a political offence…. There is every reason to consider whether this charge is excluded by the extradition treaty, and to do so before the long and very costly process of considering all the evidence should the treaty apply. But Baraitser simply dismissed the argument out of hand.” District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is severely criticised for failing to treat the two sides evenhandedly and for appearing to take instructions from the US Government people in the courtroom. Assange’s defence team, according to Murray’s report, asked for the extradition hearing, scheduled for 25 February, to be delayed to allow more time for preparation. They have had very limited contact with their client in jail and haven’t been allowed to provide him with necessary documents. Assange has only just been given limited computer access and all his relevant records and materials were seized from the Ecuadorean Embassy by the US Government. He’s had no access to his own materials in preparing his defence. The team are also in touch with the Spanish courts about a legal case currently being heard in Madrid which will provide evidence showing how the CIA arranged for a contractor to spy on conversations between Assange and his lawyers discussing his defence against these extradition proceedings. In normal circumstances, says Murray, this and other damning evidence would be enough to have the case thrown out. However, Baraitser accepted the prosecution’s argument that there should be no extra time for the defence to prepare. And she ruled, without giving reasons, that there would be no separate consideration as to whether the charge was a political offence excluded by the extradition treaty. “The extradition is plainly being rushed through in accordance with a Washington dictated timetable,” says Murray. “Apart from a desire to pre-empt the Spanish court providing evidence on CIA activity in sabotaging the defence, what makes the February date so important to the USA?” The most sinister revelation came at the end. Baraitser announced that the substantive hearing in February will be held, not at an open and accessible venue like Westminster Magistrates Court, but at Belmarsh Magistrates Court, “the grim high security facility used for preliminary legal processing of terrorists, attached to the maximum security prison where Assange is being held”. Murray says: “There are only six seats for the public in even the largest court at Belmarsh, and the object is plainly to evade public scrutiny and make sure that Baraitser is not exposed in public again to a genuine account of her proceedings, like this one you are reading. I will probably be unable to get in….” Craig Murray calls Assange his friend and is distressed by how his appearance has deteriorated after long confinement, and by his rapid ageing and stumbling speech – “the most articulate man, the fastest thinker, I have ever known” reduced to a “shambling and incoherent wreck”, says Craig. He is in such poor shape that there are fears Assange may not live to the end of the extradition proceedings. Murray had been sceptical of claims that debilitating drugs were forced on Assange and his treatment amounted to torture. “Yesterday changed my mind entirely and Julian exhibited exactly the symptoms of a torture victim brought blinking into the light, particularly in terms of disorientation, confusion, and the real struggle to assert free will through the fog of learned helplessness.” Baraitser, says Murray, told Assange that if he was incapable of following proceedings, his lawyers could explain what had happened to him later. And here’s a man who, by the very nature of the charges against him, was acknowledged to be highly intelligent and competent, and feared by the world’s super-power. So how do his British captors explain his swift decline while in their care? Murray describes the conditions under which Assange languishes at Belmarsh. “He is kept in complete isolation for 23 hours a day. He is permitted 45 minutes exercise. If he has to be moved, they clear the corridors before he walks down them and they lock all cell doors to ensure he has no contact with any other prisoner outside the short and strictly supervised exercise period. There is no possible justification for this inhuman regime, used on major terrorists, being imposed on a publisher who is a remand prisoner.” This is hardly the British justice we were brought up to admire and expect. So I have asked my MP to obtain an explanation from our Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP. A few simple answers would be appreciated: ⦁ Why is Assange held under the inhuman conditions reserved for terrorists when he’s no such thing and only on remand? ⦁ How does the Justice Department account for Assange’s poor physical and mental state? ⦁ Now that the Article 4 ‘cat’ is out of the bag why has the question whether political charges are excluded from the treaty not been addressed? ⦁ The US has had years to prepare its case, why not give Assange’s defence team more time, easier access and a sporting chance? ⦁ Why Belmarsh for February’s hearing, where the opportunity for public scrutiny is minimal? ⦁ Will District Judge Baraitser preside over the substantive hearing when, according to Murray, she has already failed to behave impartially? Many will see the hand of the Dark State in this. Whatever one’s views on Assange there is no excuse for the vile treatment meted out to him. Stuart Littlewood 24 October 2019 Loading...

Bogdanov said that “everything” should return to the control of the legitimate government in Damascus, stressing that this don’t mean the end of the political process in the war-torn country. “This does not cancel the political process, constitutional reform, negotiations and resolution 2254. But all the papers, all the official statements say that all parties involved must honor and respect the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of the Syrian state,” the Russian senior diplomat added. Syria’s biggest oil fields, including al-Omar and Rmelan, are located in the northeastern region. Key processing facilities such as the CONICO gas factory are also located in the region. These oil fields are controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and local Arab militias, which are running an illegal oil trade in the region. Despite the ongoing U.S. withdrawal from northeast Syria, recent reports revealed that the Pentagon may leave up to 200 troops in the region to control the oil fields and prevent Syrian troops from recapturing them.

Israel is the biggest example of this methodology, as it has used it on the Palestinians from the beginning of its invasion. This PressTV story is already updated by Al-Jazeera, with the Iraqi defense minister stating that US troops will be transiting either to Kuwait, Qatar or the US within a month. It looks like US Defense Secretary Esper was responding to the bad press over the US overused position that we can go anywhere we want to fight terrorism, which trumps (pardon the expression) anyone’s national sovereignty. There are multiple versions of this scam, like “we want to protect Syrian oilfields”, an outrageous thing to say when the US backed an insurgency whose methods included systematically destroying Syrian infrastructure. I recently watched a half-hour documentary on the Syrian electrical workers, who over and over went out into the field unarmed to repair the electrical grid, even while under fire. Snipers were even shooting workers in cherry pickers, and yet the workers never refused a repair order. It is one of the unsung stories of bravery during the Syrian war. Repair workers would step on a mine, get blown to bits, and their colleagues would pick up the pieces, put them in a blanket, and continue working. It’s an incredible story… Jim W.

Esper is expected to address the matter in meetings with Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi as well as his Iraqi counterpart, Najah Hassan Ali al-Shammari, on Wednesday. More than 100 US military vehicles crossed into Iraq from northeastern Syria on Monday. The redeployment followed US President Donald Trump’s order to withdraw all American troops from northeastern Syria. Speaking in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Esper said he planned to hold talks with Iraqi authorities regarding the redeployment. He said US troops will be stationed in Iraq “temporarily,” and that Washington sought to “eventually get them home.” This is while he had said last week that the nearly 1,000 troops withdrawing from northern Syria were expected to move to western Iraq to allegedly continue the campaign against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group and “to help defend Iraq.” Those comments prompted a stern response from the Iraqi military, which said in a statement that US forces crossing into Iraq as part of a pullout from Syria were not allowed to stay on Iraqi soil. Washington has currently 5,200 troops based in Iraq on a purported mission to fight the Daesh terror group, which collapsed in the Arab country in late 2017. Trump had earlier raised anger and concerns in Iraq by saying that Washington’s presence in the country was meant to “keep an eye” on neighboring Iran. Loading...

VT Correspondent Nana is to the Mufti’s right, interpreting. – First published … October 22, 2019 – Following a negotiated settlement in Sochi earlier on Tuesday, the Turkey Defense Ministry has announced that Operation Peace Spring is complete. “At this stage, there is no need to carry out a new operation,” the Turkish Defense Ministry said in a statement early Wednesday morning. Although a five-day ceasefire brokered with the US to permit Kurdish forces to withdraw from the operation zone had just expired, the office of Defense Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu noted the withdrawal was complete. The Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), US-allied militias that formed the core of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been accused by Erdogan of supporting the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey, which Ankara claims is a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, Turkish forces invaded eastern Syria with the ostensible goal of shutting down cross-border support between the groups, which they hoped to do by driving the YPG out of a 32-kilometer-deep “Safe Zone.” However, after days of fighting and worldwide outcry, US Vice President Mike Pence negotiated a 120-hour ceasefire to facilitate a Kurdish withdrawal beyond the “Safe Zone.” However, the agreement hammered out between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin Tuesday in the Russian city of Sochi made this a Russian and Syrian concern, with joint Russian-Turkish patrols in the area and Kurds beyond the 32-kilometer area safe from Turkish attack. Any Kurdish forces remaining in the “Safe Zone” will withdraw beyond that zone, and subsequent border crossings related to PKK support would fall under Russia’s responsibility as per the 1998 Adana Agreement. “Good news seems to be happening with respect to Turkey, Syria and the Middle East,” US President Donald Trump tweeted, just moments after the Turkish Defense Ministry’s statement. “Further reports to come later!” Loading...

(Historic Environment Scotland) Lasers Help Scientists Spot 900 New Archaeological Sites on Scotland’s Isle of Arran by Jason Daley Smithsonian.com The Isle of Arran located off Scotland’s west coast is one of the most archaeologically rich sites in all of Great Britain. The island is home to some of the British Isles’ most impressive prehistoric sites, featuring Neolithic stone circles and standing stones, ancient burial grounds and cairns, and the remains of Stone Age and Bronze Age homes. Now, a recent airborne laser scan of the area has found 900 previously unknown archaeological sites on Arran, promising to rewrite the 6,000-year human history of the island, the BBC reports. Some of the newly spotted sites include medieval farmsteads, prehistoric settlements and a rare cursus monument, which is a ceremonial ditch with parallel earthworks on either side that is not normally found on Scotland’s west coast, according to a project description from Historic Environment Scotland, the agency that conducted the survey. “This survey has shown us that there are double the number of ancient monuments on Arran than we previously knew about,” Dave Cowley, rapid archaeological mapping manager at Historic Environment Scotland, tells the BBC.

    "articleText": "By Nauman Sadiq for VT Islamabad Christianity in its present form came into being after the eleventh century schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Church. Before that, it used to be an exclusively Byzantine affair and most of Western Europe followed pagan customs. The reason why Catholic historians fabricated the history of ancient Roman civilization was to dissociate Christianity from its Byzantine heritage. The theory that Christianity spread into Europe, and also in Russia, from the Byzantine Empire is validated by the fact that early Middle Ages – from 5th to 10th century, when the Byzantine Empire reached its zenith and a split occurred between the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic churches in 1054 – are referred to as Dark Ages, whereas the period between 8th century BC and 6th century AD is rather ironically called Classical Antiquity. There appears to be clear historical bias because in descending order, as we go back in time, the reliability of information reduces proportionally. Thus, the 11th century recorded history of the Roman Catholic Church is comparatively credible, whereas Before Christ folklore transmitted mainly through oral traditions of fabulists is simply implausible. Historically, on Christmas Day 800 AD, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, forming the political and religious foundations of Christendom and establishing in earnest the French monarchy’s longstanding historical association with the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, ninth century appears to be a watershed moment of increasing proselytization of Europe to Christianity, which obviously had its impact in Britain and Germany later. After that, the influence of the Byzantine Empire, lasting from 4th to 15th centuries, waned and a rival power center emerged in the form of Roman Catholic Church patronized by kings of Franks and Lombards in Italy. Evidently, Christianization of Eastern Europe and Russia is attributed to the Byzantine Empire and Western Europe to the Holy Roman Empire. Thus, the history of ancient Romans, whose empire purportedly fell in 476 AD to Germanic tribes, is nothing more than folklore and the history of the Roman Catholic Church in earnest began after the coronation of Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor. The title of Holy Roman Emperor remained with Carolingian family of Charlemagne, the ruler of Franks, up to 840, and then it passed on to Germans when Otto I was declared Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 962. Thus, the Frankish Empire constituted the Holy Roman Empire during the early 9th century, and then the title was assumed by the Germanic Empire for the next eight centuries. The Germanic decentralized phase of the Holy Roman Empire never reached the glory of the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne and his successor Louis the Pious. They adopted Latin as the official language of the Empire to forge a political identity distinct from the Byzantine Greeks. Carolingians jointly ruled over Franks and Lombards in Italy, thus the Roman Catholic Church was under their suzerainty, which at the time was nothing more than a diocese of the Eastern Orthodox Church. During the period of the Byzantine Papacy from 6th to 8th centuries, the title of the Pope was equivalent to the bishop of Rome. Although according to oral traditions, the Roman Catholic Church was founded by the apostles of Jesus, St. Peter and Paul, and was recognized by Byzantine Emperor Constantine, it’s not proved by credible history and many secular historians doubt the assertion. In the medieval era, the theological creed of the Eastern Orthodox Church was vilified as Arian heresy by the Roman Catholic Church to establish a monopoly over Christian faith in Western Europe. Arius was a theologian of the Antioch school in Hatay province of modern Turkey in 270 AD. Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which later transformed into German Protestantism. It is generally claimed that Byzantine Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity and reorganized the Empire from 324 to 337 AD. Moreover, it is also alleged, albeit mistakenly, that under the reign of Heraclius (610–641), three centuries later, the Empire adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin. Fact of the matter, however, is the Byzantine Empire wasn’t a monolith, as it had myriad dynasties of usurpers from Macedonia, Armenia etc. which spoke several East European dialects, but Latin was never introduced into the Byzantine Empire. In fact, the Byzantine Empire appears to be a continuation of Alexander’s Hellenistic Empire, as both had their arch-foes in the ancient kingdoms of Persia – Achaemenids and Sassanids. The Justinian dynasty is generally regarded as the Golden Age of the Byzantine Empire that lasted from 518 to 602 AD. During the reign of Justinian I (527–565), the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the western Mediterranean coast, North Africa, Italy, and Rome itself, which it held for two more centuries.

On Mon, Oct 28, 2019 at 3:04 AM Gordon Duff <[email protected]> wrote: We have the story on VT direct from Russian intel which confirms what you say Baghdadi is in iraq to coordinate Is Hurras al-Din Regrouping of Islamic State in Syria’s Idlib? According to a New York Times report [1], the surprising information about the Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts came following the arrest and interrogation of one of al-Baghdadi’s wives and a courier in Iraq this past summer. The report details the chronology of the US Special Ops overnight raid: “Around midnight Sunday morning — 5 p.m. Saturday in Washington — eight American helicopters, primarily CH-47 Chinooks, took off from a military base near Erbil, Iraq. Flying low and fast to avoid detection, the helicopters quickly crossed the Syrian border and then flew all the way across Syria itself — a dangerous 70-minute flight in which the helicopters took sporadic groundfire — to the Barisha area just north of Idlib city, in western Syria.” Before the publishing of the NY Times report, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported earlier [2] on Sunday that a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by warplanes belonging to the international coalition, had attacked positions of Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, in Idlib province where the Islamic State chief was believed to be hiding. Despite detailing the operational minutiae of the Special Ops raid, however, the NY Times deliberately elided over the crucial piece of information that the compound in Barisha village 5 km. from Turkish border where al-Baghdadi was killed belonged to Hurras al-Din, which has previously been targeted several times in the US airstrikes. Although Hurras al-Din is generally assumed to be an al-Qaeda affiliate, it is in fact regrouping of the Islamic State’s jihadists in northwestern Idlib after the latter terrorist organization was routed from Mosul and Raqqa and was hard pressed by the US-led coalition’s air raids in eastern Syria. It’s worth pointing out that the distinction between Islamic jihadists and purported “moderate rebels” in Syria is more illusory than real. Before it turned rogue and overran Mosul in Iraq in June 2014, Islamic State used to be an integral part of the Syrian opposition and enjoyed close ideological and operational ties with other militant groups in Syria. Thus, though practically impossible, even if Washington does eliminate all Islamic State militants from Syria, what would it do with myriads of other militant outfits in Syria, particularly with tens of thousands of al-Nusra Front jihadists, including the transnational terrorists of Hurras al-Din, who have carved out a new sanctuary in Syria’s northwestern Idlib governorate since 2015? The only practical solution to the conundrum is to withdraw all American troops from Syria and let Damascus establish writ of the state over all of Syria in order to eliminate all militant groups from Syria, including the jihadists of the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front and Hurras al-Din, though the foreign policy hawks in Washington might have objections to strengthening the hands of Iran and Russia in Syria. Before the evacuation of 1,000 American troops from northern Syria to western Iraq, the Pentagon had 2,000 US forces in Syria. After the drawdown of US troops at Erdogan’s insistence in order for Ankara to mount a ground offensive in northern Syria, the US still has 1,000 troops, mainly in oil-rich, eastern Deir al-Zor province and at al-Tanf military base. Al-Tanf military base is strategically located in southeastern Syria on the border between Syria, Iraq and Jordan, and it sits on a critically important Damascus-Baghdad highway, which serves as a lifeline for Damascus. Washington has illegally occupied 55-kilometer area around al-Tanf since 2016, and several hundred US Marines have trained several Syrian militant groups there. It’s worth noting that rather than fighting the Islamic State, the purpose of continued presence of the US forces at al-Tanf military base is to address Israel’s concerns regarding the expansion of Iran’s influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Washington’s interest in the Syrian proxy war has been mainly about ensuring Israel’s regional security. The United States Defense Intelligence Agency’s declassified report [3] of 2012 clearly spelled out the imminent rise of a Salafist principality in northeastern Syria – in Raqqa and Deir al-Zor which were occupied by the Islamic State until October 2017 – in the event of an outbreak of a civil war in Syria. Under pressure from the Zionist lobby in Washington, however, the former Obama administration deliberately suppressed the report and also overlooked the view in general that a proxy war in Syria would give birth to radical Islamic jihadists. The hawks in Washington were fully aware of the consequences of their actions in Syria, but they kept pursuing the ill-fated policy of nurturing militants in the training camps located in Syria’s border regions with Turkey and Jordan in order to weaken the anti-Zionist Syrian government. The single biggest threat to Israel’s regional security was posed by the Iranian resistance axis, which is comprised of Tehran, Damascus and their Lebanon-based surrogate, Hezbollah. During the course of 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets into northern Israel and Israel’s defense community realized for the first time the nature of threat that Hezbollah and its patrons posed to Israel’s regional security. Those were only unguided rockets but it was a wakeup call for Israel’s military strategists that what will happen if Iran passed the guided missile technology to Hezbollah whose area of operations lies very close to the northern borders of Israel. Therefore, the Zionist lobbies in Washington literally coerced then-President Obama to coordinate a proxy war against Damascus and its Lebanon-based surrogate Hezbollah in order to dismantle the Iranian resistance axis against Israel. Over the years, Israel has not only provided medical aid and material support to militant groups battling Damascus – particularly to various factions of the Free Syria Army (FSA) and al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate al-Nusra Front in Daraa and Quneitra bordering the Israel-occupied Golan Heights – but Israel’s air force virtually played the role of air force of Syrian jihadists and conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Syria during the eight-year conflict. In an interview to New York Times [4] in January, Israel’s outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. General Gadi Eisenkot confessed that the Netanyahu government approved his shift in strategy in January 2017 to step up airstrikes in Syria. Consequently, more than 200 Israeli airstrikes were launched against the Syrian targets in 2017 and 2018, as revealed [5] by the Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz in September last year. In 2018 alone, Israel’s air force dropped 2,000 bombs in Syria. The purpose of Israeli airstrikes in Syria has been to degrade Iran’s guided missile technology provided to Damascus and Hezbollah, which poses an existential threat to Israel’s regional security. Though after Russia provided S-300 missile system to the Syrian military after a Russian surveillance plane was shot down in Syria on September 18 last year, killing 15 Russians onboard, Israel’s airstrikes in Syria have been significantly reduced.

Is Hurras al-Din Regrouping of Islamic State in Syria’s Idlib? According to a New York Times report [1], the surprising information about the Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts came following the arrest and interrogation of one of al-Baghdadi’s wives and a courier in Iraq this past summer. The report details the chronology of the US Special Ops overnight raid: “Around midnight Sunday morning — 5 p.m. Saturday in Washington — eight American helicopters, primarily CH-47 Chinooks, took off from a military base near Erbil, Iraq. Flying low and fast to avoid detection, the helicopters quickly crossed the Syrian border and then flew all the way across Syria itself — a dangerous 70-minute flight in which the helicopters took sporadic groundfire — to the Barisha area just north of Idlib city, in western Syria.” Before the publishing of the NY Times report, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported earlier [2] on Sunday that a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by warplanes belonging to the international coalition, had attacked positions of Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, in Idlib province where the Islamic State chief was believed to be hiding. Despite detailing the operational minutiae of the Special Ops raid, however, the NY Times deliberately elided over the crucial piece of information that the compound in Barisha village 5 km. from Turkish border where al-Baghdadi was killed belonged to Hurras al-Din, which has previously been targeted several times in the US airstrikes. Although Hurras al-Din is generally assumed to be an al-Qaeda affiliate, it is in fact regrouping of the Islamic State’s jihadists in northwestern Idlib after the latter terrorist organization was routed from Mosul and Raqqa and was hard pressed by the US-led coalition’s air raids in eastern Syria. It’s worth pointing out that the distinction between Islamic jihadists and purported “moderate rebels” in Syria is more illusory than real. Before it turned rogue and overran Mosul in Iraq in June 2014, Islamic State used to be an integral part of the Syrian opposition and enjoyed close ideological and operational ties with other militant groups in Syria. Thus, though practically impossible, even if Washington does eliminate all Islamic State militants from Syria, what would it do with myriads of other militant outfits in Syria, particularly with tens of thousands of al-Nusra Front jihadists, including the transnational terrorists of Hurras al-Din, who have carved out a new sanctuary in Syria’s northwestern Idlib governorate since 2015? The only practical solution to the conundrum is to withdraw all American troops from Syria and let Damascus establish writ of the state over all of Syria in order to eliminate all militant groups from Syria, including the jihadists of the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front and Hurras al-Din, though the foreign policy hawks in Washington might have objections to strengthening the hands of Iran and Russia in Syria. Before the evacuation of 1,000 American troops from northern Syria to western Iraq, the Pentagon had 2,000 US forces in Syria. After the drawdown of US troops at Erdogan’s insistence in order for Ankara to mount a ground offensive in northern Syria, the US still has 1,000 troops, mainly in oil-rich, eastern Deir al-Zor province and at al-Tanf military base. Al-Tanf military base is strategically located in southeastern Syria on the border between Syria, Iraq and Jordan, and it sits on a critically important Damascus-Baghdad highway, which serves as a lifeline for Damascus. Washington has illegally occupied 55-kilometer area around al-Tanf since 2016, and several hundred US Marines have trained several Syrian militant groups there. It’s worth noting that rather than fighting the Islamic State, the purpose of continued presence of the US forces at al-Tanf military base is to address Israel’s concerns regarding the expansion of Iran’s influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Washington’s interest in the Syrian proxy war has been mainly about ensuring Israel’s regional security. The United States Defense Intelligence Agency’s declassified report [3] of 2012 clearly spelled out the imminent rise of a Salafist principality in northeastern Syria – in Raqqa and Deir al-Zor which were occupied by the Islamic State until October 2017 – in the event of an outbreak of a civil war in Syria. Under pressure from the Zionist lobby in Washington, however, the former Obama administration deliberately suppressed the report and also overlooked the view in general that a proxy war in Syria would give birth to radical Islamic jihadists. The hawks in Washington were fully aware of the consequences of their actions in Syria, but they kept pursuing the ill-fated policy of nurturing militants in the training camps located in Syria’s border regions with Turkey and Jordan in order to weaken the anti-Zionist Syrian government. The single biggest threat to Israel’s regional security was posed by the Iranian resistance axis, which is comprised of Tehran, Damascus and their Lebanon-based surrogate, Hezbollah. During the course of 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets into northern Israel and Israel’s defense community realized for the first time the nature of threat that Hezbollah and its patrons posed to Israel’s regional security. Those were only unguided rockets but it was a wakeup call for Israel’s military strategists that what will happen if Iran passed the guided missile technology to Hezbollah whose area of operations lies very close to the northern borders of Israel. Therefore, the Zionist lobbies in Washington literally coerced then-President Obama to coordinate a proxy war against Damascus and its Lebanon-based surrogate Hezbollah in order to dismantle the Iranian resistance axis against Israel. Over the years, Israel has not only provided medical aid and material support to militant groups battling Damascus – particularly to various factions of the Free Syria Army (FSA) and al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate al-Nusra Front in Daraa and Quneitra bordering the Israel-occupied Golan Heights – but Israel’s air force virtually played the role of air force of Syrian jihadists and conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Syria during the eight-year conflict. In an interview to New York Times [4] in January, Israel’s outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. General Gadi Eisenkot confessed that the Netanyahu government approved his shift in strategy in January 2017 to step up airstrikes in Syria. Consequently, more than 200 Israeli airstrikes were launched against the Syrian targets in 2017 and 2018, as revealed [5] by the Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz in September last year. In 2018 alone, Israel’s air force dropped 2,000 bombs in Syria. The purpose of Israeli airstrikes in Syria has been to degrade Iran’s guided missile technology provided to Damascus and Hezbollah, which poses an existential threat to Israel’s regional security. Though after Russia provided S-300 missile system to the Syrian military after a Russian surveillance plane was shot down in Syria on September 18 last year, killing 15 Russians onboard, Israel’s airstrikes in Syria have been significantly reduced.

    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis and Nicholas Kollerstrom Nicholas Kollerstrom has a B.A. in the natural sciences from Cambridge University, with an emphasis on the history and philosophy of science. He is also an astronomer, receiving his Ph.D. from the University College London. He was a former correspondent for the BBC and received grants from the Royal Astronomical Society to do scientific work related to the discovery of Neptune. Kollerstrom has written numerous technical articles and essays.[1] He is the author of Newton’s Forgotten Lunar Theory: His contribution to the Quest for Longitude (London: Green Lion Press, 2000) and The Metal-Planet Relationship: A Study of Celestial Influence (Eureka, CA: Borderland Sciences Research Foundation, 1993). Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers contained several of his essays on mathematician and astronomer John Couch Adams (1819-1892), astronomer John Flamsteed (1646-1719), and Isaac Newton. But because he has challenged the Holocaust establishment using science and reason, all his work was removed from the Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers. Kollerstrom was widely cited in the scholarly literature.[2] Then he began to be an intellectual outcast because he started to look at chemical evidence for how Zyklon was used during World War II. Graham Macklin, manager of the research service at the National Archives, scorns at Kollerstrom’s claims that Auschwitz-Birkenau had a swimming pool for inmates and that the inmates themselves used to listen to orchestras.[3] Macklin, because he is part of the establishment, could not investigate or refute the claim using reason because that would ruin his reputation. Therefore he chose the easy route: mockery and ridicule. But Kollestrom was not the only person to say this. People who were actually at the camp testified the same thing. Historian Paul Berben, who actually talked to numerous survivors after the camp was liberated and who meticulously looked into the archives, wrote in Dachau: The Official History: “A few sporting and cultural activities were authorized. Officially the S.S. could no longer maltreat the inmates as they liked. But the disciplinary regime remained very harsh.”[4] Even “money brought on arrival and any that was subsequently sent to a prisoner was credited to him, and he could only draw 15 R.M. monthly. As some prisoners had considerable sums of money, especially in the early years, the S.S. conducted profitable financial transactions. When in 1942 the system of ‘gift coupons’ was instituted, the prisoners could no longer have money in their possession. The money in their account had to be used for the purchase of articles obtainable at the canteen, another course of considerable profit to the camp administration.”[5] Berben notes that “theatrical entertainments, concerts, revues and lectures were arranged too. Among the thousands of men who lived in the camp there were all sorts of talents, great and small, to be found: famous musicians, good amateur musicians, theatre and musical artists. Many of these men devoted their time in the most admirable way to gain a few moments of escape for their comrades in misery, and to keep up their morale. And these activities helped too to create a feeling of fellowship.”[6] The following may shock you: “The camp had a library which started in a modest way but which eventually stocked some fifteen thousand volumes. It had been formed with the books brought in by prisoners or sent to them by their families, or from gifts. There was a very varied choice, from popular novels to the great classics, and scientific and philosophical works. “Only books in German and at the most a few dictionaries were allowed, but there were some ‘forbidden’ volumes there too, whose bindings had been camouflaged by the prisoner-librarians and which received particular attention from those who were ‘in the know.’ “The intellectuals in the camp kept the catalogues up to date and were in charge of lending out the books. Unfortunately, it was not possible for more than a very few prisoners to do any reading, so it was mainly only those lucky enough to be attached to the library who benefited from it. “Yet it is astonishing to learn that some men in spite of their miserable convicts’ existence nevertheless found the energy to take an interest in the arts, in science and in philosophical problems.”[7] In addition, letters sent to individual families “had to be written in German and to one single recipient. Contents had to deal only with family matters and no reference at all was permitted to life in the camp, or the letter was not sent off.”[8] During the last few years of the war, “it was decreed that a prisoner could send or receive two letters or two cards per month. He had to write in ink, very legibly, on the fifteen lines of each page of a letter. His correspondent could only use plain paper, and double envelopes were not allowed.”[9] Jewish historian Sarah Gordon corroborated many similar claims in her book Hitler, Germans, and the Jewish Question, which was published by Princeton University Press in 1984.[10] Putting all the pieces together, can popular historians in good conscience ignore these facts and perpetuate one incoherent assertion after another without sober thought? If Plato is right, that “having a grasp of the truth is having a belief that matches the way things are” and that “being deceived about the truth is a bad thing,”[11] how can scholars and thinking people pursue the truth if they are not allowed to ask deeper questions about the past? Weren’t we told in grade school that science begins by asking fundamental questions? Did our science teachers lie to us by exposing us to the scientific method? Did our history teachers deceive us by telling us to dig into archives, look for historical documentations and to watch out for contradictions? Furthermore, would people like Descartes, Kant, Hegel, etc., make it in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, where draconian speech codes can be found throughout Europe and America and where professors are scared to death to talk freely about certain issues?[12] Wouldn’t they be asked to seal their lips and drop their pens without rational discourse? Wouldn’t the Holocaust establishment dispatch an exorcist from Tel Aviv to cast out Descartes’ demon in France? We are going to explore some of these questions in the following interview with Nicholas Kollestrom. Alexis: Kollestrom, let’s start with a statement from your book. You write: “The fastest way to get expelled from a British university is by saying you are looking at chemical evidence for how Zyklon was used in World War II, with a discussion of how delousing technology functioned in the German World War II labour camps. “This is considered to be absolutely forbidden. How strange is that? After being a member of my college for 15 years I was thrown out with one day’s warning, having been given no opportunity to defend myself, a fact announced on its website. What I had done was so terrible that it could not announce what my crime was: I felt like Faust caught making his pact with the devil.”[13] This is quite puzzling. Don’t scientists pride themselves in looking for rigorous evidence? Don’t academic centers like the University College of London boast about free speech, particularly when a person is a noted scholar? Were you using the scientific method when you were investigating how Zyklon was used during World War II? If so, why did the academic community go banana? Did you ask them about your academic sin? Kollerstrom: I guess it was just too much for them to handle. I was a science historian in a ‘Science and Technology Studies’ department at UCL in London, Britain’s 3rd oldest university, which was supposedly set up on a secular basis, that there would not be any inquisition about private beliefs of its members of staff. But I had to realize that belief in ‘the Holocaust’ is nowadays some sort of religion, it’s the one thing that academics are not allowed to doubt or criticise. They put up on their UCL website that they were totally opposed to what I was doing, but did not say what the terrible thing was! There was just silence from my colleagues or rather ex-colleagues and I had to realise that I’d never get another paper published in an academic journal. Sure I was using the scientific method, I was comparing and critiquing two different published surveys of residual cyanide in the walls of German WW2 labor-camps. They both used much the same method of analyzing the cyanide so I pooled the two data-sets together. This gave about forty measurable samples which is quite a decent sample. What was puzzling was that in all the media damnation that ensued, no-one was interested in what I’d actually done, in the basic chemistry, it was just ‘We’ve found a Nazi!’ Alexis: Serious scientists like yourself are always on a quest for the truth, asking probing questions and discerning between evidence in order to give an accurate explanation of the available data and controversial issues. Once all rival alternatives are weighted, then inference to the best explanations should be drawn.[14] Do you think people are afraid to look at the evidence because they might find something that would not be compatible with their preconceived ideas? Are some people playing fast and loose with the facts? Kollerstrom: You have well described what the scientific method is supposed to be. I believe what is going on here is a clash between science and religion, where ethically-damned Revisionists are trying to look at scientific evidence to reconstruct the past and Holocaust-legislators wish to ban any doubt over their official narrative. My wish here is that some kind of forum could exist where different views of what happened in WW2 could be discussed. If we don’t believe in rational debate then we’re lost. You might suppose that science historians could discuss say hygiene delousing technology prior to DDT. You might suppose that is obscure enough to be a non-explosive topic. DDT started to be widely used after WW2 for this purpose. Before that for, say, forty years Zyklon delousing chambers were the normal way of doing it. It was normal hygiene technology for killing bugs in clothing and so on. So no-one’s allowed to discuss this, because that would violate the new religion, because it would soon end belief in the huge human gas chambers that existed only in WW2, only in Poland. Alexis: Scientist and academic professionals are to be skeptical about claims or assertions or even documents and examine them in light of various sources to corroborate and even challenge accepted views. If the documents show contradictions, or if they challenge our preconceived vision, then we need to slow down and reconsider our worldviews to see whether they were based on evidence or popular opinion. Why are people in the Holocaust establishment afraid to examine their metaphysical assumptions? The first principle in examining any scientific or historical account is that truth exists—even if historians or scientists do not know what it is at the moment of investigation. If truth does not exist, then ultimately the scientist is wasting his time looking for clues, which lead to hypotheses, theories, and ultimately scientific “facts.” Do people in the Holocaust establishment believe that truth actually exists? Do they think that truth is to be pursued and fabrications and colossal hoaxes ought to be avoided? I have interacted with a number of academics over the years on this issue, and I was quite stunned to realize that not a single one of them actually believes in serious scholarship, despite the fact that they write books superficially postulating that evidence matters. One of them would not even give me permission to publish the interaction because that would ruin what he said in a book which was ironically published by the University of California Press. Kollerstrom: I reckon they, i.e. people in the Holocaust establishment, believe that truth is what they want to believe.[15] They will always endeavor to undermine historical-factual debate about What Really Happened with claims about alleged emotions, of love or hate, such as: ‘You are just an anti-Semite’, or ‘You really hate …’ Whatever.[16] Or they will claim to be hurt. My colleague Richard D. Hall who does ‘RichPlanet’ recently wrote to various different Jewish ‘Holocaust’ groups in the UK which are especially concerned with ‘Holocaust education’ – and that is big business over here – asking if they could provide anyone who could debate the issue, but none of them would. The professional skepticism of scientists just goes right out of the window where this topic is concerned I’m afraid. I agree with you totally about the mental enslavement which academics here display. For example, a few years ago a team from Britain’s University of Birmingham science department went to Treblinka with ‘ground penetrating radar’ equipment. They didn’t find a single gassed body, or any bodies under the ground come to that, no gas chambers, zilch. No wait, they found some shark’s teeth in the ground. This was promoted by the British media as having confirmed the canonical story that eight hundred thousand people mainly Jews had been gassed using diesel exhaust in that transit-camp. Was the British scientific establishment bothered that diesel-exhaust is not actually lethal and couldn’t have gassed anyone? No, evidently not. Or, to give a US example, Elie Wiesel’s Night (which has supposedly sold twelve million copies) has been used in many ‘Holocaust study’ courses in American universities. That features the primary Holo-image of burning piles of human corpses. They are just set on fire, and they burn. Why has not the US Society for Advancement of Science protested at such nonsense being taught in universities? Alexis: I read Nick Cohen’s article in the Guardian about you and I was completely shocked to read some of the statements that this man propounded. He titled his article: “When academics lose their power of reason.” Does an academic lose his power to reason when he asks probing questions? Cohen quoted philosopher Jeremy Bentham saying that “As to the evil which results from a censorship, it is impossible to measure it, for it is impossible to tell where it ends.”[17] He moved on to say that “Admittedly, if the philosopher had lived long enough to hear the conspiracy theories of the 21st century, even his defence of free speech might have weakened.”[18] I think Bentham would have been stunned to see how the Holocaust establishment itself is an impediment to serious science, history and reason, since true science is determined by rigorous evidence, not by ad hominem attack, straw man and red herring such as “conspiracy theories.” Would you agree? I am pretty sure that Cohen has never read your work on some of these issues. In fact, you state quite rationally in the book: “We need to find out how to discuss [the ‘Holocaust’] calmly, how to respect different viewpoints, and what are the primary sources we should be consulting.”[19] Kollerstrom: Sure. I got vilified by Nick Cohen in The Observer right after being chucked out of my College – having been in it for fifteen years – and discovered that I was allowed no right of reply. The Observer thereby put a death-wish against me by allowing Cohen to say I needed to be stuffed and put next to Jeremy Bentham (his stuffed body being on display at UCL). As you note, Cohen was there dismissing conclusions drawn from measurements of cyanide in the walls of the German labor-camps as a ‘conspiracy theory.’ He used an effective form of discourse designed to terminate debate and replace it with a fairly simple emotion – hate. A lot of people hated me after I’d been through all this, and that was a new experience. Alexis: You wrote: “After somewhat over a decade of quiet academic research, my life changed rather abruptly as I became ethically damned, thrown out of polite, decent groups, banned from forums and denounced in newspapers, with half my friends not speaking to me anymore—while the other half still would, provided I kept off ‘that awful subject.’ “So as a philosopher I was granted an unusual and excellent opportunity to ponder the difference between what is real and what is illusory. I should be grateful to my fellow-countrymen for absolutely refusing rational debate on this topic, for insisting on my silence over it, and for transforming discussion into insult. “I know what I have been through. I have been well-cooked…The damnation cast upon me was ostensibly political…Going into my local, or even my gym, I felt as if some Mark of Cain had been branded onto my forehead.”[20] You also said that “no one seemed interested in what I had actually done, namely synthesize a couple of chemical investigations concerning residual wall-cyanide taken from World War II labour camps.”[21] Now, that is the work of a serious scientist. What kind of investigation do you think the Holocaust establishment was expecting? Did you ever ask some of their representatives the kind of evidence or scientific enquiry they would accept? Kollerstrom: Plato’s metaphor of the Cave seems to have suddenly become very relevant in the 21st century. He there described how people were chained to see just the flickering images on the wall, which they mistake for reality. They become furious with any persons who come from the above-ground world who try to tell them about it and seek to destroy them. We surely have to believe – as you Sir have tried to show in various articles – in some sort of Logos principle which means that we can by debate find together by logic whatever the truth is. I think that the ‘Holocaust establishment’ is concerned to promote stories, of alleged ‘Holocaust survivors. We need to bear in mind the catastrophic situation that has here developed, where the German government has been paying and continues to pay anyone who claims to be such a Holocaust-survivor.[22] That is a very strong motivation for memory-enhancement, shall we say. These people then go into schools. Their ‘memories’ are promoted by the Establishment, and anyone who challenges the accepted wisdom gets ethically-damned. The UCL I would want to have belonged to would have had detailed debate about brick and wall absorption of cyanide gas, the nature of the ferrocyanide complex and when it turns blue, and whether it remains permanently in the brick. It would have commissioned a new investigation to go and visit Birkenau-Auschwitz and chip away some further brick samples, and used the very latest chemical-assay procedures for measuring the cyanide. But, maybe that only happens in some parallel universe…. This article was first published in the summer of 2016.

    "articleText": "(PLoS One) Health Editor’s Note: This is a place that we have not visited. We really wanted to. We arrived at 3:30 one day and they were already closed. It made no difference to the Italians that we traveled all the way from the U.S. and would have very much liked/loved to have experienced this awesome historical/archaeological site. When you are traveling by car and making your own schedule as it comes, things like this can happen, especially before we had the everlasting phone with us which would have instantaneously given the closing times. Time before the smart phone, when you actually navigated with a map….anyway, there is a great deal of information about Mt. Vesuvius, Herculaneum, and Pompeii online. It is not often that you can experience an actual cataclysmic occurrence and have daily life frozen in time. Life was frozen in time…..Carol Mount Vesuvius Boiled Its Victims’ Blood and Caused Their Skulls to Explode by Jason Daley /Smithsonian.com/October 2018 In 79 A.D., Mount Vesuvius erupted, blanketing the nearby Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum in hot ash and preserving the casualties in lifelike poses. And as awful as being smothered by ash may be, a new study suggests that suffocation wasn’t the cause of death for many victims. Archaeologists have found that some people perished in a pyroclastic surge, a wave of superheated gas and hot ash that literally boiled their blood and caused their skulls to explode, reports Neel V. Patel at Popular Science. The evidence comes from boat houses in Herculaneum, a seaside resort town for wealthy Romans about 11 miles from Pompeii. In the 1980s and 1990s, archaeologists began uncovering the remains of several hundred people who had huddled in the shelters at the water’s edge to wait out the eruption. For hours the volcano, which had not erupted for hundreds of years, shot ash and chunks of pumice into the air, causing many people to evacuate or to seek shelter in solid structures. But it appears that a flow of superheated gas rolled down the mountainside at hundreds of miles per hour and blindsided the people in the waterfront chambers. Read More: Loading...

    "description": "The music, born of gypsies in the country’s southern regions, was embraced by foreigners long before it became a national symbol",
    "articleText": "www.pinterest.com The Complicated History of Flamenco in Spain by Sandie Holquin/Zocalo Public Square/Smithsonian.com During the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair, an advertisement for the Bates textile company in the Pavilion of Spain’s guide book featured a fetchingly posed young woman, rose in mouth, with a ruby red bedspread draped over her body to form the likeness of a flamenco dress. The text beckons us to “fall in love with Spain—and Bates’ ‘Flamenca!’” and encourages us to discover “fashion’s new passion in bedspreads … each bedspread smoldering with two tones of a hot-blooded color.” In the U.S. and elsewhere, flamenco is a pervasive marker of Spanish national identity. For proof of its currency in pop culture, look no further than Toy Story 3: Buzz Lightyear is mistakenly reset in “Spanish mode,” and becomes a passionate Spanish flamenco dancer. Indeed, the world outside Spain often stereotypes the nation as inhabited by flamenco dancers, singers, and guitar players who are so “passionate,” they have little time to engage in the day-to-day world of the mundane. Inside Spain, however, the relationship between the flamenco art form and Spanish national identity has been fraught for more than a century. Indeed, the world’s love of flamenco has long created problems within Spain, where the performance was once considered a vulgar and pornographic spectacle. Read more: Loading...

    "articleText": "WHILE TERRORISM IN the U.S. is relatively rare, over the last decade most politically motivated violence has come at the hands of far-right extremists. Despite that reality, the FBI has devoted disproportionate resources to the surveillance of nonviolent civil society groups and protest movements, particularly on the left, using its mandate to protect national security to target scores of individuals posing no threat but opposing government policies and practices. Since 2010, the FBI has surveilled black activists and Muslim Americans, Palestinian solidarity and peace activists, Abolish ICE protesters, Occupy Wall Street, environmentalists, Cuba and Iran normalization proponents, and protesters at the Republican National Convention. And that is just the surveillance we know of — as the civil liberties group Defending Rights & Dissent documents in a report published today. The report is a detailed catalog of known FBI First Amendment abuses and political surveillance since 2010, when the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General published the last official review of Bush-era abuses. The incidents the report references, many of which were previously covered by The Intercept, were largely exposed through public records requests by journalists, activists, and civil rights advocates. The FBI relentlessly fought those disclosures, and the documents we have were often so heavily redacted they only revealed the existence of initiatives like a “Race Paper” or an “Iron Fist” operation, both targeting racial justice activists, while giving away little detail about their content. read more: https://theintercept.com/2019/10/22/terrorism-fbi-political-dissent/ Loading...

    "description": "David Duke must be credited for saying that “If the world had been aware of the Jewish tribalism behind Communism and the most massive violation of human rights in all of history, certainly the world would have averted crimes such as the horrific Iraq War, motivated by the Zionist agenda, and based entirely on lies.”",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis David Duke puts it well in The Secret Power Behind Communism when he writes: “The Bolshevik Holocaust is an horrific story that all people who love life and freedom should learn the truth about if they are not to be doomed to repeat such horrors. If the world had been aware of the Jewish tribalism behind Communism and the most massive violation of human rights in all of history, certainly the world would have averted crimes such as the horrific Iraq War, motivated by the Zionist agenda, and based entirely on lies. “It was empowered by their symbiosis of media and government influence. Preventive the wars they have created in the Mideast would have saved millions of lives. Many of the Zionist techniques of terrorism, ethnic cleansing, torture and murder in Palestine and across the region were learned long ago in their Bolshevik revolt against civilization.”[1] Duke again is right on target. As Neocon Francis Fukuyama of Stanford himself has argued, the Neoconservative movement is a continuation of the Bolshevik Revolution which got its start in Leninism and Trotskyism[2] and which ended up killing millions upon millions of people virtually around the world,[3] including in far-distant lands such as China.[4] And if you think this is farfetched, then consider this. In 2010, the Iraq war logs revealed that there were at least 15,000 civilian deaths that were unrecorded.[5] After the war, Americans had to introduce Israeli-style torture in places like Abu Ghraib, and forcing prisoners to have sex with one another and sodomizing teenagers was fair game.[6] There is more: the estimate of lives lost in the war in Iraq alone is between 100,000 to 600,000, including thousands of civilians. In 2003, at least 12,000 civilians lost their lives. The first three years of the war produced between 104,000 and 223,000 civilian deaths. When it was over, 2.3 million Iraqis had been forced to flee their homes and towns; by 2008, another 2.7 million Iraqis were displaced, and nearly half a million civilians ended up losing their lives.[7] Thousands upon thousands of other people went missing by 2008.[8] This is out of a total Iraqi population of about 30 million people.[9] When the war was over, sectarian violence and car bombings were rampant—almost every day.[10] The Iraq war itself shook the entire nation and created havoc even by 2006.[11] Factions of society that once coexisted were dismantled. In a nutshell, Iraq was in decay. Buildings and farmlands were destroyed.[12] And the fringe benefits of the war? Between 300,000 and 360,000 veterans returned home with brain injuries,[13] some of which went untreated.[14] By 2005, more than 6,000 soldiers serving in Iraq committed suicide.[15] In 2012, more soldiers committed suicide than died in combat,[16] making it the year with the highest suicide rate since 2001.[17] In addition, the war has sent the American taxpayers a bill of $6 trillion,[18] combined with a debt ceiling keeps rising every six months or so.24 The US national debt had reached $16 trillion by the end of 2012.[19] Torture was also routine in Afghanistan, where adolescents were beaten with hoses “and pipes and threats of sodomy.”[20] Forcing prisoners to have sex with one another and sodomizing teenagers was fair game. One prisoner testified that he saw one officer “fucking a kid, his age would be about 15-18 years. The kid was hurting very bad and they covered all the doors with sheets. Then when I heard the screaming I climbed the door because on top it wasn’t covered and I saw [name blacked out], who was wearing the military uniform putting his dick in the little kid’s ass. I couldn’t see the face of the kid because his face wasn’t in front of the door. And the female soldier was taking pictures.”[21] What’s more even interesting, “150 inmates were crammed into cells designed for 24.”[22] Abu Ghraib, as one writer put it, was “a hell-hole.”[23] These acts were not done in the dark. Cambridge University published similar reports in a book that is more than 1200 pages long.[24] These acts were also testified to by psychiatrists such as Terry Kupers.[25] But there is more to sex after the Iraq war than meets the eye and ear. When the war in Iraq was over, Iraqi women began to engage in prostitution. Since thousands upon thousands of Iraqis suffered after the war, many of them began to abandon their children and even sold them to sex slavery. One sixteen-year-old girl by the name of Nada who got caught in this dilemma told BBC News in 2007, “I have no one there and in my case I am afraid for my life. My family has abandoned me.”[26] The girl was forced into the sex business in Syria “after her father dumped her at the border, and was facing deportation when the story aired.”[27] Other women who found themselves in the dilemma were former nurses, sales clerks, students, etc. A thirty-four-year-old whose home was bombed and who also lost her mother during the same event lamented, “I have no home anymore, no family, no piece of land.” The report declared of her, “She was shot twice while working for the U.S. military in the Green Zone. When she fled to Jordan penniless and couldn’t find a job, she turned to prostitution.”[28] Other stories are simply heart-breaking: “An Iraqi interviewed by the Associated Press in July said she doused herself and her 14-year-old daughter in gasoline in an attempt to end it all after she gave a smuggler her life savings—$18,000—to take them over the border from Turkey to Greece. “The smuggler vanished. She said she would have killed herself rather than sell her body, which seemed her only option. But her daughter’s tearful pleas prevented her from lightening the match. ‘She was in my arms, soaked with gasoline, and shivering from fright,’ she said. ‘I was so desperate, and there was no way out.’”[29] Yanar Mohammed, founder of Women’s Freedom in Iraq, added, “In Syria, we hear that some women reach the point where they are begging strangers passing by to exploit them sexually so they can feed their children. You know, women of Iraq were not in this situation, I would say, six years ago. We did not have to do this. We did not have to go through humiliation. Through prostitution.”[30] Other parents who could not cope with the post-war situation sold their children to countries as far away as India, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.[31] The same sex business was still vivid in 2009 in the same regions. Yanar Mohammed said that many of the traffickers have “very good ties with the police. It turns out [the cops] were loyal customers.”[32] The girls in those places were as young as 11 and 12, and once a girl reached 20 years old, she was considered too old.[33] The sex business once again cropped up in 2010 and 2011.[34] Fast forward to 2013, Iraq was still trapped in the sex trafficking business.[35] One study declared that the brothels in some of those regions “have been established purely to meet the demand created by United States service personnel…While sexual exploitation existed in Iraq, as anywhere, long before the war began in 2003, ‘the invasion and instability that followed led to an environment where young women and girls became much more vulnerable to trafficking.’”[36] Arab society traditionally values female virginity,[37] but the Jewish or Israeli wars forced them into sex slavery. Just seven years after the war, “about 4,000 women, one fifth of them aged under 18, disappeared.”[38] The perpetual wars also produce a form of sexual calculus in the military—the likes of which we have never seen before. The Washington Post declared that three rapes happen every hour in the military now.[39] This issue has been going on since 2003.[40] The Washington Post broke another story saying that an Air Force recruiter was facing charges of forcibly performing sodomy on eighteen young women, whom he had tried to recruit, over a three-year period.[41] People in charge of programs designed to stop sexual harassment were arrested for involvement in sexual harassment.[42] Moreover, at least one Army sergeant ran a prostitution ring on the military base,[43] and even forced others into prostitution.[44] The sergeant was later identified as Sergeant First Class Gregory McQueen.[45] It is estimated that 26,000 people were sexually assaulted in 2012. 19,000 were assaulted in 2010.[46] These figures could be higher, since many victims fail to report that they were assaulted.[47] The sad thing is that when thousands of those women got back home, they had to face the horror of living with guilt, and some began to descend into a life of drugs and homelessness.[48] Those women excelled in the army, but going home was not always a pleasant thing because there were fewer jobs.[49] Jennifer Cortez, then 26 years old, provided excellent service as an Army sergeant and received 12 medals within eight years. When her time was up, she got back home only to be offered a job at minimum wage—sweeping floors. The only home Cortez had was her own car. At least 53 percent of those who had been sexually assaulted were homeless when they went back home. And when those same people could no longer work, they got their pension funds looted by “predators,” to use the New York Times’ own words.[50] In addition, people who have been disabled due to the war are finding that it is very hard to get their disability benefits. There were at least 600,000 of those cases in spring 2013.[51] Men Get Raped, Too It is not just women who have been raped in the military. The Washington Times declared that at least 10,700 men were sexually abused in the military in 2010. Navy Petty Officer Third Class Brian Lewis testified that he “was raped by a petty officer…told by a commander not to report it, and later was diagnosed with a personality disorder and discharged.”[52] The Washington Times stated, “The Defense Department estimates 19,000 sexual assaults occur each year, but only 17 percent are ever reported. In 2010, there were an estimated 19,300 sexual assaults—8,600 victims were female and 10,700 victims were male, according to Anu Bhagwati, executive director of Service Woman’s Action Network.”[53] In other words, those people who gave their all in the military and who eventually were sexually abused are now trapped in a neo-Bolshevik matrix which gives them no chance. The only escape is to follow the Zionist/neoconservative heaven on earth. ***************** Keep in mind that torturing prisoners of war, according to the Founding Fathers, was a forbidden territory. As historian David Hackett Fischer has argued, “In Congress and the army, American leaders resolved that the War of Independence would be conducted with a respect of human rights, even of the enemy. This idea grew stronger during the campaign of 1776-1777, not weaker as is commonly the case in war.”[54] John Adams in particular knew that his enemies used cruelty on prisoners. Yet he wrote a letter to his wife stating that such behavior should not take place among his soldiers.[55] George Washington put Adams’ principle to work. Some even persuaded leaders in Congress to adopt the British way of treating prisoners, but Washington refused.[56] When quarter was denied to American soldiers, many pressed Washington to follow the “eye for an eye” principle, but still he never gave in to the pressure. In other words, Washington had all the justification in the world to return the favor to his British prisoners. Yet Washington treated British troops differently and “with the same human rights for which Americans were striving.”[57] Washington’s prisoners expected that he would treat them as the British treated the American prisoners. Yet they were astonished when Washington treated them as human beings. Whenever British soldiers were captured, Washington would send letters to the specific town saying that the prisoners “were innocent people in this war, and were not volunteers, but forced into this war.”[58] In another letter, Washington asked that the British prisoners be treated “with humanity, and let them have no reason to Complain of our Copying the brutal example of the British army in their Treatment of our unfortunate brethren…Provide everything necessary for them on the road.”[59] Not only that, he asked that the prisoners should be treated as friends. One prisoner, Johannes Reuber, wrote later that “conditions improved for us. Old, young, rich and poor, and all treated us in a friendly manner.”[60] As a result, many of the former British soldiers—some 3,194 of them—chose to stay in America.[61] This has been one of the central issues in American history, and people like George Washington would almost certainly have been appalled at what happened in Iraq and Abu Ghraib. Contrast that to our day, when the Neo-Bolsheviks took over America, or when the twentieth century, to use Yuri Slezkine’s own term, has progressively become “Jewish.”[62] What does the twentieth century produce? Well, the world witnessed debacles in places like Iraq. And who largely produced the war? Perhaps it is time to summon flaming Zionist Thomas Friedman of the New York Times. He told Haaretz in 2003 that the plan for war in Iraq “was disseminated by a small group of 25 or 30 neoconservatives, almost all of them Jewish, almost all of them intellectuals (a partial list: Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, William Kristol, Elliott Abrams, Charles Krauthammer), people who are mutual friends and cultivate one another and are convinced that political ideas are a major driving force of history. “They believe that the right political idea entails a fusion of morality and force, human rights and grit. The philosophical underpinnings of the Washington neoconservatives are the writings of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Edmund Burke.”[63] William Kristol “is believed to exercise considerable influence on the president, Vice President Richard Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; he is also perceived as having been instrumental in getting Washington to launch this all-out campaign against Baghdad.”[64] Wolfowitz was so aggressive about invading Iraq that one Republican lawmaker declared Wolfowitz “was like a parrot bringing [Iraq] up all the time. It was getting on the President’s nerves.”[65] After one such meeting in Washington, we are told that Colin Powell rolled his eyes, declaring, “Jeez, what a fixation about Iraq.”[66] Once again, Duke must be credited for saying that “If the world had been aware of the Jewish tribalism behind Communism and the most massive violation of human rights in all of history, certainly the world would have averted crimes such as the horrific Iraq War, motivated by the Zionist agenda, and based entirely on lies.” [1] David Duke, The Secret Behind Communism: The Ethnic Origins of the Russian Revolution and the Greatest Holocaust in the History of Mankind (Mandeville, LA: Free Speech Press, 2013), 23.

(The National Archives) The Untold Story of the Secret Mission to Seize Nazi Map Data by Greg Miller/Smithsonian Magazine November 2019 The fighting for Aachen was fierce. American planes and artillery pounded the Nazi defenses for days. Tanks then rolled into the narrow streets of the ancient city, the imperial seat of Charlemagne, which Hitler had ordered defended at all costs. Bloody building-to-building combat ensued until, finally, on October 21, 1944, Aachen became the first German city to fall into Allied hands. Rubble still clogged the streets when U.S. Army Maj. Floyd W. Hough and two of his men arrived in early November. “The city appears to be 98% destroyed,” Hough wrote in a memo to Washington. A short, serious man of 46 with receding red hair and wire-rimmed glasses, Hough had a degree in civil engineering from Cornell, and before the war he led surveying expeditions in the American West for the U.S. government and charted the rainforests of South America for oil companies. Now he was the leader of a military intelligence team wielding special blue passes, issued by Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, that allowed Hough and his team to move freely in the combat zone. Their mission was such a closely guarded secret that one member later recalled he was told not to open the envelope containing his orders until two hours after his plane departed for Europe. In Aachen, their target was a library. Read more: Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "title": "Is Healthcare in Mexico a viable option for Veterans and Retirees?",
    "description": "Have Concerns? Learn more about Healthcare in Mexico",
    "articleText": "by Conner Wallis-Collins, Living Lake Chapala I recently read an article on Living Lake Chapala called Healthcare Analysis in Ajijic, Lake Chapala, Mexico. It was talking about healthcare costs in Mexico and just how affordable it was. It had me wondering if Mexico had better healthcare options than the US for vets and people without insurance. According to the World Healthcare Rankings Mexico sits in 61st place for healthcare while the US is in 37th place. I don’t think anyone would disagree that the level of healthcare in terms of equipment is a little better in the US than in Mexico, but that level of care comes at a high price. There are good and bad doctors on both sides of the border and now the equipment that was scarce is readily available at a reasonable price. The general consensus is that healthcare spending in the US is seriously messed up with medical tech being upgraded on an almost yearly basis and this massive spending and high costs ends up placed on the individual as well as insurers. According to data released by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2018, the U.S. rate was a whopping $10,000 per capita. Not only are healthcare costs prohibitive for those who are uninsured but insurance companies seem to automatically reject all claims making it a difficult and lengthy process to get your money. Meanwhile in Mexico getting healthy is cheap by comparison. (See Cost of Living in Mexico). People only spend a 1/5 on healthcare compared to the US, for any given ailment and people report an astounding 90% satisfaction rate. People who receive healthcare in Mexico consistently talk about how much time their doctor spends with them and how they felt like their doctor actually cared and listened (a major complaint about US healthcare is the lack of one on one attention they receive), they talk about how they like having options as to what kind of level of healthcare they are able to receive. In fact, people usually talk about having a much better experience in Mexico than in the US. The largest community of expats in Mexico is on the north shore of Mexico’s largest freshwater lake, Lake Chapala. This community pays on average approximately $20 USD for a doctor’s visit and $1,000 USD for insurance ( depending on age and overall health currently), so many of them don’t keep high levels of health insurances they can afford to pay as they go and many will just keep insurance for emergencies with a high deductible. I’ve found that when you talk to these people, they will often tell you that they feel much safer knowing that if anything happened to them where they require service that it wouldn’t bankrupt them. Conner Wallis-Collins So the point I am trying to make is that it is understandable to have concerns about the quality of the health care system in Mexico. But, luckily, these concerns are unfounded as people are happier, healthier, and feel safer knowing that they can receive healthcare at reasonable rates without the ultra-high levels of very expensive care.

    "articleText": "Photo by Carol Duff Why Are Insurance Executives Treating Our Patients? by Kevin Campbell M.D./Medpage Today In two recent surveys, physicians said that pre-authorizations are burdensome to their practice and that they could lead to adverse patient outcomes. Kevin Campbell, MD, agrees that the insurance companies shouldn’t be part of patient practice, and says that the peer-to-peer review process is even worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. The following transcript has been edited for clarity. Insurance companies have been granted far too much control over patient care over the last several decades. Nowhere is it more apparent than when physicians are asked to obtain “pre-approval” for guideline-based, medically necessary procedures. According to one survey from the Medical Group Management Association, 83% of those surveyed said prior authorizations are “very” or “extremely” burdensome to their practice and their staff. Another survey conducted of physicians found that nearly one-third of doctors believe that spending time obtaining pre-authorizations actually led to adverse patient outcomes. Ninety percent of those practice managers have indicated that the amount of pre-authorizations have significantly increased over the last year. To illustrate the sheer volume of this work, there were 182 million pre-authorization transactions conducted last year alone. While Congress has given lip service to this issue by hosting a hearing with doctors in September, no real changes have occurred. In fact, the insurance companies have lobbied Congress that these pre-authorizations are needed to reduce costs and prevent unneeded treatments. Read More: Loading...

    "description": "Kanye West: “Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction. My dad had a Playboy left out at age five, and it’s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life, from age five to now, having to kick the habit.”",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis If you think that the Powers That Be do not prey on people’s weaknesses and then make them slaves for the rest of their natural lives, then think again. Kanye West has recently admitted that his introduction to porn started with Playboy magazine. He said: “Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction. My dad had a Playboy left out at age five, and it’s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life, from age five to now, having to kick the habit.” He added: “Money, clothes, cars, accolades, the advent of social media, a Twitter account, paparazzi photos, going to Paris Fashion Week — all of that. I suffer — and I appreciate the suffering because we can just feel a little bit of what Jesus felt when we suffer, but social media makes me suffer. I suffer from that and by me saying this out loud, I’m sure there’s other married men that suffer in a similar way that are happy to hear me say, ‘Oh ya, I’m suffering.’” When asked the question, “Why just married men?” Kanye responded: “Because social media prompts women in particular to put out content that they wouldn’t have put out.” “So, you’re referring to addition?” Kanye again replied: “Yeah, definitely… I deal with my addiction. When I was younger and I wanted to see something like that I had to pay someone that was older to go to 7/11 and buy it.” Perhaps Kanye West should pick up a copy of Euripides’ The Bacchae. In The Bacchae, Euripides introduces us to Pentheus, who is the king of Thebes and who represents the anti-thesis of social disorder and chaos. Pentheus observes that Dionysus, the god of wine and sexual revelry, is the real cause of sexual licentiousness in Thebes. All Dionysus has to do to create moral decay throughout the land is unleash sexual debauchery among the women in particular. How? Simple: Allow the women to leave their looms and dance naked on the mountainside. The men would eventually be drawn to their sexual and uncontrolled passion, which means that they will also drop their moral cognition and intuition. The end result? The men will eventually be slaves to their passion, and that can also lead to their ultimate and tragic death. In short, once the mind has been subdued by a potent ideology, namely uncontrolled sexual passion, the person in question is no longer a good man but a slave. As Augustine rightly put it, “Thus, a good man, though a slave, is free; but a wicked man, though a king, is a slave. For he serves, not one man alone, but what is worse, as many masters as he has vices.” Later, Edmund Burke added that “men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.”[1] What we are saying here is that lust and uncontrolled sexual passion always lead to moral and intellectual blindness, moral blindness inexorably leads to “sin city,” and “sin city” leads to spiritual death. This deduction has been understood by a wide range of individuals—from Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Reich and all the way to comic book writers such as Allan Moore. Going back to Pentheus. In order to put an end to Dionysus’ lust, which drives the men into sexual madness, Pentheus captured Dionysus. When Dionysus was locked up, he told Pentheus that Pentheus was actually his slave. This obviously befuddled Pentheus. How am I his slave, Pentheus seemed to reason, when I got him in chain? In other words, Dionysus allowed himself to be captured by Pentheus because he wanted to seduce the very man who seeks to prohibit sexual debauchery. To make a long story short, Dionysus asks Pentheus if he would like to see the women (Maenads) dance naked on the mountainside. Pentheus, of course, was flattered and seemed to have been instantly sensually aroused. We could imagine Pentheus saying, “You mean I’ll have unlimited access to naked women? Heck, yeah! Oh brother, what man would say no to that? When will I get to see those beautiful sights?” Pentheus—like Shelley, Byron, Wilde, Sartre, Russell, Wells, Schopenhauer, and more recently Gore Vidal, Bill Clinton, Julian Assange, David Patraeus, Herman Cain, Athony Weiner, Mark Sanford, Samuel B. Kent, John Edwards, Larry Craig, Mark Foley, Brian J. Doyle, Wade Sanders, Newt Gingrich, Mel Reynolds, Ken Calvert, who could not keep their pants up—could not perceive that Dionysus was preying on his sexual weakness and then leading him to his pathetic death. Pentheus actually says, “Aye, indeed! Lead on. Why should we tarry?…That would I, though it cost me all the gold of Thebes!” At that point, Pentheus’ moral reasoning began to wane precisely because lust has started to take over his moral being. Dionysus was shocked to see that Pentheus was willing to go the extra miles to see those naked women. Dionysus says, “So much? Thou art quick to fall to such great longing.” Keep in mind that Dionysus has used other means to persuade Pentheus to abandon his moral path but failed. Dionysus finally rested on the sexual dimension, which Pentheus could not resist and which turned out to be an instrument of control. Moreover, Dionysus quickly learned that talking about naked women was much more persuasive and alluring than positing philosophical syllogism. In the twentieth century, Wilhelm Reich discovered those sexual principles from personal experience. He eventually declared that “Sexual consciousness and mystical sentiments cannot coexist.”[2] Reich was not the only person to discover this either/or dichotomy. But he was one of the first persons to articulate this in the twentieth century. Once the culture began to accept Reich’s principles, the social order swiftly evaporated from the minds of many. Reich postulated that the sexual revolution could not take place without “a powerful international sex-economic organization.” Dionysus led Pentheus to the mountainside and the naked women ended up tearing Pentheus apart in a sexual frenzy, leading him to a bloody and tragic death. Pentheus’ own mother, Agave, was also one of the maenads who participated in the Dionysian frenzy. Being intoxicated by the revelry and being possessed by Dionysus, she ripped off Pentheus’ head without realizing that it was her own son. Agave went back to the palace and began to talk about how she triumphantly ripped off a lion’s head—meaning his own son’s—and how fulfilling the whole phenomenon was. Yet right after she became sober and to much of her chagrin, she realized that she had killed her own son. Agave wept bitterly and inconsolably, but it was too late. Nothing could replace her son. Pentheus got what he wanted: he got to see naked women, but it cost him his own life. So the logic is pretty straightforward: If you can manipulate a person’s passion—most particularly his unbridled, sexual passion—then you can manipulate his behavior. If you can manipulate his behavior, then you can make him do what you want. During the French Revolution, Marquis de Sade ended up producing a treatise which articulated this point in the most pornographic way. But Sade’s sexual metaphysics did not die during the French Revolution. This sexual component has also been propounded in many different ways since Sade penned his Philosophy in the Bedroom in 1795. With Talmudic and Masonic backing, the sexual virus traveled from France to England, from England to Germany,[3] and then from Germany in the 1920s and 30s[4] to America in the 1960s during the sexual revolution.[5] By 1946, one of the British intellectuals who realized that the movement sweeping Europe and America would have to be sexual was Aldous Huxley. “For myself, as for no doubt most of my contemporaries,” Huxley wrote in Ends and Means, “the essence of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation…We objected to the morality because it interferes with our sexual freedom.”[6] One can say that the feminist movement is largely based on this central doctrine: morality is either irrelevant or obsolete because it interferes with people’s sexual freedom. Sexual freedom logically leads to the Enlightenment and to people like Marquis de Sade. According to the Enlightenment view of things, morality is a relic of the past, and people ought to be free to pursue any activity without restraint. It is “liberty.” De Sade again articulated this in a more interesting way. “The philosopher,” he argues, “sates his appetites without inquiring to know what his enjoyments may cost others, and without remorse.” Sade here was trying to suppress guilt, conscience, and morality. Once that was done, then Sade took another ideological move. “A pretty girl,” he writes in Philosophy in the Bedroom, “ought simply to concern herself with fucking, and never with engendering.” With morality and order removed, de Sade was free to follow any impulse and encourage others to do the same: “You girls who have been tied down by the absurd and dangerous bonds of an imaginary virtue and a disgusting religion: imitate ardent Eugenie. Destroy, trample, as swiftly as she, all the ridiculous precepts inculcated by moronic parents.” Sade further deconstructs the moral order by saying, “It’s absurd to say that this mania is unnatural. Can it be censured if nature inspires it in us? Can nature dictate something that degrades it?”[7] Here we are getting closing to the inexorable truth: according to the Enlightenment, which now got morphed into feminism, nothing is immoral. Sade was following the logical outworking of Enlightenment philosophy, which, like feminism, promised freedom on the surface but delivered moral and intellectual bondage. How is it intellectual bondage? Well, very easy. If women should be “free to act however they want,”[8] as feminist and Zionist Mayim Bialik tells us, do men get to enjoy that privilege and honor? If not, why not? Why are feminists so prejudice? What logical move that allows them to apply one law for women and a completely different law for men? Is that fair? And if they think that men ought to grant the same right, then how can we really say that people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby did something wrong? Don’t all the feminists out there condemn both Weinstein and Cosby? You see, no matter how you cut it, the feminist movement lacks moral and intellectual backbone. t doesn’t abide by what Immanuel Kant calls the categorical imperative or practical reason, which is our only defense against oppression, the oligarch and the elite. Kant declares: “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”[9] He continues to say that for an action to be good, “it is not enough that it should conform to the moral law—it must also be done for the sake of the moral law.”[10] As I argued elsewhere, any intellectual project that does not prostate before practical reason will fall. That’s what happened to Darwin, and his intellectual children are still trying to erect a philosophically repugnant and existentially worthless edifice. [1] E.

    "description": "The trouble started in 2013, when sea stars, an urchin predator, began to die off",
    "articleText": "www.pinterest.com Voracious Purple Sea Urchins Are Ravaging Kelp Forests on the West Coast by Brigit Katz/Smithsonian.com The coastal waters of northern California were once home to undulating forests of bull kelp, a type of seaweed that offers shelter to a host of sea creatures. But a series of adverse ecological events have jolted the region’s marine ecosystem out of whack. Populations of purple sea urchins, a voracious, kelp-eating species, have exploded. And now, according to a new study in Scientific Reports, more than 90 percent of bull kelp canopy along 217 miles of California’s coast is gone. The first sign of trouble arose in 2013, when sea stars in the area were hit with a mysterious disease and began “wast[ing] to nothing,” as the University of California, Davis puts it in a statement. Sea stars play an important role in their ecosystem, preying on native purple urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and keeping their numbers in check. With mass numbers of sea stars dead, the urchins proliferated, chomping their way through the kelp forests. Researchers aren’t sure where the sea stars’ illness came from, reports Discover’s Leslie Nemo. But they believe climate change was responsible for what happened in 2014 when a record-breaking marine heatwave that fueled the bull kelp’s decline. Read more: Loading...

The results also confirmed that “neutron stars have neutrons in them,” study lead author Darach Watson, an astrophysicist at the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, told Space.com. “That sounds really dumb, but it’s something we haven’t known for sure.

    "articleText": "In a previous article I mentioned that this Marine was facing deportation. Now it has actually happened. Yesterday he was deported to El Salvador, a country he has no memory of. I have received emails which said that the only reason I was supporting this young man was that he was an immigrant. This is totally false. This is only one of thousands of incidents where our government has simply discarded “used” soldiers. There are many thousands of veterans who are now living on our streets as homeless people. In this case the government had an “excuse” to simply deport him and make him someone else’s problem. What is different here is that in El Salvador there are gangs that target former US soldiers for murder. Since he has brain damage, he probably does not know how to defend himself or even that he is in danger. Our neglect of veterans is, unfortunately, nothing new. There are still a few remaining Viet Nam veterans who are still trying to get relief from their exposure to agent orange. Apparently DHS and ICE were trying to conceal their activities as they failed to inform his lawyer or family as is the regular procedure. Aris Folley 15 hrs ago Marine Corps Marine Corps vet who served in Iraq deported to El Salvador Segovia-Benitez’s attorney Roy Petty told the Phoenix New Times that he didn’t find out Segovia-Benitez had been deported until after he arrived for a planned meeting with his client at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Arizona where he was being held. “Certainly, this is a surprise,” he told the paper Wednesday. “ICE kept his deportation a secret. They kept it a secret from him, me, his other attorney, and they kept it a secret from his mother. It’s not common practice.” “Generally, what ICE will do is they will notify the person so the person can make arrangements. They woke him up and put him on a plane,” he continued. An ICE spokeswoman confirmed Segovia-Benitez’s deportation in a statement to The Hill on Wednesday. “Mr. Segovia-Benitez was removed to his home country Oct. 23 in accordance with federal law and the policies and procedures of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” she said. She also noted that shortly after an immigration judge ordered Segovia-Benitez’s removal, he “subsequently appealed his case with the Board of Immigration Appeals, which denied the appeal.” “He also filed two stay requests with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, both of which were denied,” she added. The report is the latest update in a high-profile deportation case that has garnered widespread attention in recent weeks. Segovia-Benitez served two tours in Iraq before he was honorably discharged in 2004, a year after he suffered a brain injury. The veteran also received a number of decorations for his service during his time in the military, according to NBC News. But after he was discharged from the military, Segovia-Benitez began to self-medicate with alcohol, his family said, which led to trouble with authorities. He ended up serving time in prison for a variety of crimes, including assault with a deadly weapon and injuring a spouse, for which he received an eight-year prison sentence. Segovia-Benitez’s family members have said that while they do not condone his criminal actions, they believe the government failed to provide adequate care for him after he was discharged. Brandee Dudzic, executive director of the group Repatriate our Patriots, told ABC News that Segovia-Benitez wasn’t diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder until 2011, seven years after he was discharged from the military. His lawyer told the Phoenix New Times that his team is still working on his case and hopes “that ICE will correct this problem and allow him to come back to fight his case.” “What would certainly be horrible would be if he were kidnapped or killed in El Salvador before that,” Petty said while expressing concern that Segovia-Benitez, who doesn’t speak Spanish fluently, could be targeted in El Salvador. “Gangs target former U.S. military,” he told the paper. “They’ll kidnap a person, they may hold a person for ransom, they may torture an individual.” dhs Loading...

The Trump administration and Betsy Devos were having none of this…..Carol ‘Stop the insanity’: Top education official resigns and endorses loan forgiveness By Aarthi Swaminathan/Yahoo Finance A senior student loan official appointed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned on Thursday, the Education Department confirmed to Yahoo Finance. “We run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody… but it rides on their credit files—it rides on their back—for decades,” A. Wayne Johnson, the Department of Education’s Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, told the Wall Street Journal. “The time has come for us to end and stop the insanity.” Outstanding student debt stands at $1.48 trillion as of the last quarter, according to the New York Fed. Borrowers in the current system are facing loan burdens that are souring quickly: Out of the outstanding severely derogatory balance, 35% are defaulted student loans. Those in public service who applied for Public Service Loan Forgiveness are seeing 99% rejection rates. Johnson called for federal student loan debt up to $50,000 be forgiven on an individual basis and tax credits provided up to $50,000 for debt already paid. He said the idea developed after joining the administration and discovering the difficulties borrowers were facing with their student loans. The plan would cost an estimated $925 billion, according to Johnson. Read More: Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

(HHMI Tangled Bank Studios) Fossil Site Reveals How Mammals Thrived After the Death of the Dinosaurs by Riley Black /Smithsonian.com In central Colorado, at a place called Corral Bluffs, there lies an unusual graveyard. The ranks of the dead aren’t filled with people, but animals that lived 66 million years ago. Preserved in hardened concretions of stone lie the remains of turtles, crocodiles, and most of all, mammals that lived in this place during the first million years after the terrible impact that triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs. These animals form a part of our own evolutionary narrative—the story of how mammals went from scurrying around the feet of larger creatures to dominating the continents of the world, evolving into a variety of unique beings, including ourselves. Mammals are not recent additions to the world that came after the time of the dinosaurs. The oldest mammals go back much further in time, and contrary to the standard story of shrew-like critters kept in check by monstrous reptiles, mammals thrived during Mesozoic era. The asteroid impact that felled the “terrible lizards” was also a portentous event for the mammals that had already been plying their own success for tens of millions of years. The mammalian story is a complicated one. Read more: Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "Sajjad Shaukat Book Review: Invisible Balance of Power By Ian Greenhalgh The world underwent a seismic change on September 11th, 2001 when the biggest, most blatant false flag terror even yet seen took place–the attack on the World Trade Centre in NYC and the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The official narrative blamed Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda Islamic terrorist group, a complete fabrication that has had far-reaching consequences. The creation of the Islamic terrorist bogeyman began long before 9-11, the stereotypical fanatic menacingly waving AK47s and RPGs while screaming incoherently about Allah has been a mass media meme for decades–the 1985 Hollywood blockbuster Back To The Future featured a gang of Libyan terrorists, a decade later the James Cameron-Arnold Schwarzenegger movie True Lies had a plot revolving around Islamic terrorists and stolen nuclear weapons. Clearly, powerful, shadowy figures in the West have sought to inculcate the minds of the public with the notion that Islamic terror was the new threat to peace and prosperity, to the Western, capitalistic way of life. They have used the mass media to drive this train of thought and sadly, they have been all too successful. A string of further false flag terror events blamed on Islamic fanatics has played out in countries such as Great Britain, France and Germany, the Western public has been sold on the idea that Islamic fundamentalists are a clear and present danger. It is impossible to gain any meaningful insight into the true nature of these events and the forces driving them from the Western media, both the mainstream and ‘alternative’ forms have been utterly corrupted and co-opted. However, there are still those who seek to subvert the Western narrative and publish the truth about the geopolitics and Machiavellian machinations behind the events of the post 9-11 world. One such figure is Pakistani author Sajjad Shaukat, in his book, Invisible Balance of Power, first published in 2005 and now republished fourth time in a revised edition, Shaukat examines the phenomena of terrorism and explains how there are both state and non-state actors behind the scenes. An example of the former would be the United States, of the latter, Al-Qaeda is the prime example. The book is packed with solid research and delves far deeper into this murky world than any Western author dares tread. Shaukat is remarkably even-handed, his analyses notably free of prejudice as he compares and contrasts the tactics and techniques employed by both sides in the so-called ‘War On Terror’. The book contains detailed analysis of Al-Qaeda’s methods–the beheadings, the targetted assassinations, the hostage taking, the suicide bombings and the ambush attacks using improvised explosive devices. However, it also covers the methods used by the United States and it’s allies–the CIA black site prisons and their torture cells, the drone strikes, the kidnappings, the use of private military companies and their mercenaries. Through painstaking research and in-depth analysis, Shaukat makes a compelling case that both sides in the War On Terror have employed the most cruel and ruthless terroristic methods and are responsible for the deaths of countless innocent civilians, the great majority of them citizens of Islamic countries. The author goes further by placing this insightful analysis of the War On Terror against the backdrop of the global financial, social and political situation and giving a prescient viewpoint on how international finance and politics have been and will continue to be influenced by the perpetual nature of the wars involving both sides of the War on Terror; how social and economic instability has been created. One might consider this viewpoint to be almost clairvoyant, given recent unrest in France by the Gilets Jaunes and the ongoing violence in Afghanistan, to name just two examples. Besides, author’s future assessments such as failure of the power factor or role force by the US-led countries in this ‘different war’ against the non-sovereign entities, prolonged war on terror, entanglement of the US/NATO countries in Afghanistan, increase in the cost of war, internal crises inside America, loss of America’s leverage of bargaining even on the small countries, economic instability in the world, state terrorism, resulting into more terrorism by the non-state actors as noted in case of Indian-Israeli brutal tactics on the Kashmiris and Palestinians, war in Syria, promotion of sectarian divide in the Islamic countries on the basis of Shia and Sunni, rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, war-like situation between Syria and Israel, between Iran and Israel, between India and Pakistan, rise of Russia and China-their collective efforts for moving the world to the multi-polar system etc. proved true. Shaukat also presents the reader with a set of proposals for resolving this mess, including reconciliation of warring parties and reform of the UN to empower the less powerful, less developed nations, thus leaving the reader with a sense of hope that this global conflict can be resolved. Even if you do not agree with all of his analyses, you will come away from reading this book armed with a far deeper and more realistic understanding of the post 9-11 world than you could ever hope to garner from consumption of the Western media and that makes it compelling reading for all those who wish to develop a greater, more accurate knowledge of this world we live in.

    "articleText": "Geopolitics in Middle East: What was the Intention of the USA? Written by Enkidu Gilgamesh CONTENT Building Kurdistan Pipelines for Energy-Security The domino effect CIA made ISIS, AlQaeda, AhrarAlSham … Pivotal Kurdistan and Genie Costs of Imperialism Genie and the other oil thieves! Dead end and exit Cleaning up the murderous mess! . 1. Building Kurdistan The USA, together with the EU and Israel wanted to have a Kurdish state from northern Iraq to the Mediterranean Sea, including a big chunk of Turkish territory to get control on petrol, gas, minerals and foremost the main water reserves of the region. The NATO members and fake-friends didn’t openly express their intentions to not offend Turkey, but Mr. Netanyahu as a member of the same coalition of united enemies against Syria has nothing to hide. I call them “united enemies“, because despite their alliance against Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Iran, all members of this coalition of the willing are hostile to each other. The controversies are described in this article series. From German: Netanyahu demands and independent Kurdish state 29. Juni 2014, 21:55 Uhr Quelle: ZEIT ONLINE, AP, sah http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2014-06/netanjahu-befuerwortung-kurdistan-isis “Benjamin Netanyahu appealed for the foundation of an independent Kurdish state. For prime minister of Israel the Kurds are a potential partner fighting against the extremists.” From German: Kurdistan and Israel – and unusual friendship Daniela Segenreich19.10.2017, 05:30 Uhr https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/kurdistan-und-israel-eine-ungewoehnliche-freundschaft-ld.1322352 “As the only state leader Benjamin Netanyahu supported the independence referendum in Kurdish northern Iraq. The Kurdish Jews living in Israel are a kind of connector between the two cultures.” . 2. Pipelines for Energy-Security When the war began from Tunisia, over to Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, the main target was to guarantee the “energy security” for Europe and USA, which means to become fully independent of Russia and Iran by building petrol and gas pipelines from Arabia, across Jordan, Syria and Turkey to Europe. This pipeline was in the interest of all members of the coalition of united enemies. Without, they are only enemies! Qatar–Turkey pipeline https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar%E2%80%93Turkey_pipeline “The Qatar-Turkey pipeline was a proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Iranian–Qatari South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field towards Turkey, where it could connect with the Nabucco pipeline to supply European customers as well as Turkey. One route to Turkey was via Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria, and another was through Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. Syria’s rationale for rejecting the Qatar proposal was said to be “to protect the interests of [its] Russian ally, which is Europe’s top supplier of natural gas.“ In long term, the exclusion should weaken Russia and Iran, break their economies and prepare them for a military invasion, to also grab their oil, water, soil and airspace. IMHO, I don’t need to deliver here sources about the long term strategic planning against Russia and Iran. Most readers should be well informed about that. Syria made the “mistake” to reject the according offer and instead to sign a pipeline contract with Iran and Iraq. But by the Iranian-Iraqi-Syrian pipeline the petrol sheikhs and the US petrodollar system would have crumbled, because they would not be able to complete with the two pipelines from Russia and Syria. Therefore the assault on Syria by imperial mercenary troops, promoted as “Islamists” was quasi “without an alternative“. Iran–Iraq–Syria pipeline https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%E2%80%93Syria_pipeline “The Iran–Iraq–Syria pipeline (called the Friendship Pipeline by the governments involved and the Islamic gas pipeline by some Western sources) is a proposed natural gas pipeline running from the Iranian South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field towards Europe via Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon to supply European customers as well as Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.“ “In July 2011 Iran, Iraq and Syria said they planned to sign a contract potentially worth around $6bn to construct a pipeline running from South Pars towards Europe, via these countries and Lebanon and then under the Mediterranean to a European country, with a refinery and related infrastructure in Damascus. In November 2012 the United States dismissed reports that construction had begun on the pipeline, saying that this had been claimed repeatedly and that “it never seems to materialize.” A framework agreement was to be signed in early 2013, with costs now estimated at $10bn; construction plans were delayed by the Syrian Civil War.“ “The pipeline would be a competitor to the Nabucco pipeline from Azerbaijan to Europe. It is also an alternative to the Qatar–Turkey pipeline which had been proposed by Qatar to run from Qatar to Europe via Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey.“ . 4. CIA made ISIS, AlQaeda, AhrarAlSham … The fear of being kicked out of the lucrative oil and gas supply to Europe brought all together to attack Syria and Iraq. It should become an easy win by a short war of only a few weeks, but when the weeks turned into months and the months into years the tides turned and the reason of their involvement in the aggression became evident. There is no international terrorism outside of control of the imperial secret services! The terrorists are recruited by them, trained side by side with the regular imperial troops, brought to battle zone and commanded and supplied with high tech logistics by the imperial military structure. Kosovo – NATO bases and ISIS training camps side-by-side in the land Washington and Brussels tore from Christian Serbia to hand to Islamist terrorists BY NICK GRIFFIN / THURSDAY, 28 JULY 2016 / PUBLISHED IN EUROPE, WAHHABISM https://apfeurope.com/2016/07/kosovo-nato-bases-and-isis-training-camps-side-by-side-in-the-land-washington-and-brussels-tore-from-christian-serbia-to-hand-to-islamist-terrorists/ “The main training camps set up by the Islamic State are Ferizaj, Gjakovica and Dečani, while smaller ones have been identified in Prizren and Pejë. Their existence suggests that – at best – Nato has failed completely in the drive to prevent the spread of Islamic radicalism, or – at worst – that there are actually hidden links between the Islamist training camps and their Nato neighbours.“”The most outrageous example is the ISIS camp in Ferizaj, a city of 100,000 inhabitants near the border with Macedonia, which is just a few miles from the US Camp Bondsteel. Built in 1999 during the war, with a 14km perimeter, this is currently the largest and most expensive American base built outside the United States.” Suspicions Run Deep in Iraq That C.I.A. and the Islamic State Are United DAVID D.

But that appears to have done little to tamp down the conspiracy theories still circulating from the streets of Baghdad to the highest levels of Iraqi government that the C.I.A.is secretly behind the same extremists that it is now attacking.” “Haidar al-Assadi, 40, agreed. “The Islamic State is a clear creation of the United States, and the United States is trying to intervene again using the excuse of the Islamic State,” he said.” ISIL: Ugly Washington’s Child P 04.06.2015 U Vladimir Platov https://m.journal-neo.org/2015/06/04/isil-washingtons-child-new-proof/ “The stated report of the Defense Intelligence Agency – (DIA), originally classified as «SECRET // NOFORN» and dated August 12, 2012, was sent to many US government agencies, including CENTCOM, CIA, FBI, DHS, NGA, the US State Department and many others. From these documents, it follows that in 2012 the US intelligence clearly understands the growing threat to peace from ISIL. However, the US administration decided to use this terrorist organization in solving their regional problems in the Middle East, including the weakening of the Muslim regimes in Syria, Iraq, Iran and several other countries. The documents of the US government agencies published by Judicial Watch visually confirm that the Al-Nusra arming process was directly coordinated by the US intelligence. Al-Nusra was joined ISIL and other jihad groups. American arms, delivered to Syria, including anti-tank missiles, was made available to ISIL Al-Nusra’s militants back in 2012, including through direct weapon supply to ISIL from Washington’s allies – Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Support from Washington for the Saudi project to create an ‘Islamic state’ was acknowledged by Robert Ford, a former US ambassador to Syria, in his recent interview for Foreign Policy Journal. He pointed out that the US protection of this terrorist group with the help of former officers of Baathist army was a huge mistake.“ From German: Israeli general captured in Iraq- He confirms close cooperation between Isreael and ISIS! http://deruwa.blogspot.com/2015/10/israelischer-general-im-irak-gefangen.html ISIL Sends Long Military Convoy towards Battlefields with US Chopper’s Back Up http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940824000479 Iraqi Army Downs 2 UK Planes Carrying Weapons for ISIL Mon Feb 23, 2015 6:29 https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13931204001534 “The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard. The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.“ ““The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations. He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”“ ““The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.“ “The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.“ Foreign planes dropping military aid for Islamic State in Kirkuk http://www.therussophile.org/foreign-planes-dropping-military-aid-for-islamic-state-in-kirkuk.html/ ““After the US army’s special heliborne operations in Southwestern Kirkuk, unknown planes dropped military supplies and other aids for the ISIL in the Southern part of Kirkuk,” an Iraqi security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told FNA on Tuesday.” Journalist Interrogated, Fired For Story Linking CIA And Syria Weapons Flights by Tyler Durden Aug 28, 2017 11:15 AM http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-28/journalist-interrogated-fired-story-linking-cia-and-syria-weapons-flights “Investigative reporter Dilyana Gaytandzhieva authored a bombshell report for Trud Newspaper, based in Sofia, Bulgaria, which found that an Azerbaijan state airline company was regularly transporting tons of weaponry to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Turkey under diplomatic cover as part of the CIA covert program to supply anti-Assad fighters in Syria. Those weapons, Gaytandzhieva found, ended up in the hands of ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists in Iraq and Syria.“ US plane supplying ISIS terrorists with weapons, ammunition and provisons in Tal Afar, Iraq. How the self declared global empire is using geophysical warfare, “colored revolution” and asymmetrical methods of warfare with mercenaries framed as “freedom fighters” in regions, where it cannot invade with regular troops, without openly breaking international law, should be delved more specifically in another article. However, it is partly treated here and other articles of this blog: Misery of Syria Yemen Iraq comes from failing meteorology science!

Pivotal Kurdistan If Kurdistan was formed according initial planning, the Arabs would be separated from the north. By controlling Kurdistan the USA would fully dominate the whole region. The mountainous region is a geopolitical pivotal hub for all aspects of geostrategy, geopolitics and geoengineering. The USA could not give up Kurdistan, as long as a little hope remained to keep it, because this chunk of resources rich territory would be the only win of the operation on Syria and Iraq for now. But without access to the shores of Mediterranean Sea, Kurdistan has no free access to international waters and airspace and is surrounded and closed by enemies. Such an isolated entity doesn’t make any sense and cannot be supported without getting in conflict with the neighboring states. Turkish-US Relations Won’t Recover Until US Drops ‘Greater Kurdistan Project’: https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201801251061062646-turkish-us-relations-prospects-analysis/ As long as the hope for Kurdistan could be kept alive, the reaction of the USA on any threatening approach was accordingly fierce. The Turkish Security Forces (TSF) got a taste of carnage, that may be awaiting them in Menbij or any other part of the territory under the control of SDF (Syrian Defense Forces) by observing the deadly attack on Syrian Army troops by the US forces in Deir ez-Zor. 62 Dead, 100 Wounded as US Bombs Syrian Army Near Deir ez-Zor. Bombing Was in Support of ISIS-Daesh Militia Par Alex Lantier, Mondialisation.ca, 20 septembre 2016, World Socialist Web Site 19 septembre 2016 https://www.mondialisation.ca/sixty-two-dead-100-wounded-as-us-bombs-syrian-army-near-deir-ez-zor-bombing-was-in-support-of-isis-daesh-militia/5546787 The parlous factor for the TSF was, that its weapons were mainly from military industry of USA and EU and 2. or 3. quality and deadly inferior compared to the US artillery, drones, rockets, helicopters and fighter jets. Major escalation! “Syrian pro-regime forces included approximately 500 personnel in a large, dismounted formation supported by artillery, tanks, multiple-launch rocket systems and mortars,” a US official said, claiming that more than 100 of those fighters were killed. — Ali Özkök (@Ozkok_A) February 8, 2018 The morbid strategy game of the USA could trigger Turkey’s exit from NATO, which would make NATO practically useless. As the dream of Greater-Kurdistan or any autonomous Kurdish entity is dead, the US-President openly declares that US troops are there to “secure the oil“. For whom? Without an agreement with the Syrian government, the USA won’t profit from these reserves and such an agreement should not be expected after so much death and destruction caused by the US mercenaries and imperial structure. . 6. Costs of Imperialism The USA have spent billions into the nation building project of Kurdistan! Most of it was financed by the Saudis. Qatar and Emirates. Please read the specific article in this series about that. The US Will Spend $500M on Syrian Kurds This Year. For What? BY ROBERT FORD, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SYRIA AND DEPUTY AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ, FEBRUARY 27, 2018 https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/02/us-will-spend-500m-syrian-kurds-year-what/146275/ “Yet the Trump administration’s proposed defense budget for 2019 aims to transform the SDF into a 35,000-man local security force, at a cost of another $300 million in 2019; this would come on top of the $393 million it plans to spend on ammunition and weapons for the group this fiscal year; the total amount set to be spent on the SDF this year is $500 million.“ “Today, the United States has a policy of incrementalism, working on behalf of one player in the Syrian morass. America’s adversaries will learn how better to attack U.S. forces and allies. With time, U.S. personnel will face greater risk while the deepening morass will demand either concession or escalation. The Trump administration and Congress would do well to come to terms with that reality.“ The U.S. Will Spend Billions in Syria—Just Not on Rebuilding It The Trump administration has ended a civilian-aid program in the country, but the cost of the counter-ISIS fight far outweighs those savings. KRISHNADEV CALAMUR, AUG 20, 2018 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/us-syria/567895/ “The U.S. is still providing humanitarian assistance to Syria, with nearly $8 billion spent since the conflict started in 2011.“ Fact check: Trump says the US has given ‘massive’ assistance to the Kurds.

The Kurds played a key role in that fight.” . 7. Genie and the other oil thieves! The investments and efforts don’t come of altruism, as the expected revenues should go into trillions. In preparation of success a very interesting oil company was founded by involving very famous, powerful and rich people from the USA and UK. Genie Energy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy “The president of its Israeli subsidiary is Effie Eitam. Genie Energy’s Strategic advisory board is composed of: Dick Cheney (former vice president of the United States), Rupert Murdoch(media mogul and chairman of News Corp), James Woolsey (former CIA director), Larry Summers (former head of the US Treasury), Bill Richardson (former Governor of New Mexico, ex-ambassador to the United Nations and United States Energy Secretary)[2], Michael Steinhardt, Jacob Rothschild,[3][2], and Mary Landrieu, former United States Senator from Louisiana.“ By its Israeli subsidiary, Genie Energy is intentionally breaking international law and stealing Syrian reserves by exploring for oil and gas on the occupied Syrian territory.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Saturday.“ “The ministry spokesman said that “the space intelligence images showed that oil was actively extracted and massively exported for processing outside Syria, under the reliable protection of US troops, before and after the defeat of the Daesh* terrorists.”“ “Commenting on the satellite intelligence, Maj. Gen. Konashenkov said US operations in eastern Syria and its actions regarding Syrian oil could only be described as “international state banditism.” He added that Syria’s oil belongs to the Arab Republic, and not to Daesh or to “American protectors from Daesh.”“ “According to Russian intelligence, the illegal US-supervised extraction of Syrian oil was being carried out by “leading American corporations” and private military contractors, with US special forces and air power used for protection. Konashenkov said the estimated monthly revenue of this ‘private enterprise’ was over $30 million, and that for that kind of money, the Pentagon and the CIA would be “ready to ‘guard’ Syrian oil wells from ‘hidden Daesh cells’ indefinitely.”“ . 8.

Zbigniew Brzezinski: “If the United States is Pushed Out of Middle East, It’s Not Going to Survive“ https://www.21cir.com/2015/10/if-the-united-states-is-pushed-out-of-the-middle-east-it-is-not-going-to-survive/ Under the pressure of the whining imperialist investors, Donald Trump has ordered his remaining troops to “secure the oil Syrian oil from ISIS”. I cannot say if Donald Trump is trying to calm down the bankrupt oil investors or just ridiculing them, but he should not risk the lives of US soldiers. It is time to leave by keeping some dignity before being beaten out of Syria. Syrian oil is not worth for further exposing and embarrassing the USA as a bandit and pirate state and walking dead empire. @atrupar TRUMP on Syria’s oil: “We’ve secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US Troops will remain in the area. Where they have the oil. And we’re going to be protecting it, and we’ll be deciding what we’re going to do with it in the future.“ We Can’t Keep the Oil Trump’s new rationale for keeping troops in Syria makes no sense.

First, Syria doesn’t even rank among the world’s top 60 oil producers, pumping out only about 0.05 percent as much petroleum as Iraq—just half as much as Cuba, which isn’t known as an oil power. Second, its oil fields aren’t America’s to protect. They are owned by the Syrian government, with some venture capital provided by China, Russia, and India. No American oil companies are keen to step into the fray. In any case, the cease-fire agreement that Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed with Turkey—the deal that Trump has touted so proudly—pretty much removes the United States as a political, economic, or military power in the entire area.“ Petrodollar Armageddon Approaches as One of the World’s Largest Oil & Gas Companies Dumps Greenback CC BY-SA 2.0 / Sergio Russo / Green Oil, BUSINESS, 19:08 26.10.2019 https://sputniknews.com/business/201910261077157637-petrodollar-armageddon-approaches-as-one-of-the-worlds-largest-oil–gas-companies-dumps-greenback/ “The US dollar currently enjoys the coveted status of the world’s de-facto reserve currency, with all oil purchased from the powerful cartel known as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) priced in greenbacks. However, some countries have recently attempted to challenge this state of affairs.“ “Russian energy giant Rosneft, the world’s eighth largest oil and gas company by total revenue, and the largest in terms of production volume and reserves, has completed the switch away from the dollar in favour of euros in export contracts, company CEO Igor Sechin has announced, speaking to participants at the Eurasian Economic Forum in Verona, Italy this week.“ “Sechin also commented directly on the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, saying he believed China had the potential to challenge the dollar in the near future. “I think that the yuan will have the best chances of being used as a reserve currency due to the growth of the Chinese economy,” he said. According to the official, although the dollar is being used in over 60 percent of global trade today, including a whopping 90 percent of trade in oil and oil products, this picture will change over the next decade.“ “Rosneft set the euro as the default currency for its oil export contracts earlier this month amid US threats to sanction the company over its continued operations in Venezuela.“ If Donald Trump delays the retreat too long, not only tomatoes and potatoes may be thrown on the fleeing US troops! #Kurdish residents in the city of Qamishli block the path of the American forces withdrawing from northern #Syria and throw tomatoes at them following President Trump's order for the #US soldiers to retreat from the region – ANHA pic.twitter.com/PB513uC8ft — Rudaw English (@RudawEnglish) October 21, 2019 . 9.

    "articleText": "The ambassador called the situation “the most dangerous possibility regarding INF [treaty],” adding that this possibility will demand that Russia responds accordingly. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said Sunday that if INF-covered missiles are deployed in Europe, this will force Moscow to retaliate. “We have always said that it concerns the security, first of all, of US allies and the United States itself,” the Ambassador said. “The most dangerous moment regarding intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles is the appearance of this class of missiles in European states.” The ambassador warned that the world can “return to the situation before the conclusion of this well-known treaty of the late 80s and then it will be a completely new regional and strategic situation that will require additional action from us.” Speaking on Russian television Sunday, the ambassador said that Russia is “doomed” to cooperate with the US in the fight against terrorism, adding that Russia is ready for this kind of cooperation. Commenting on Donald Trump as US President, Antonov remarked that he “fulfilled all his campaign promises, except one – to get along with Russia.” “In my opinion, it is high time we begin working on this exact issue,” the ambassador said. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty was signed in 1987 by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. It prohibited the development and deployment of ground-based missiles with a range between 500-5,000 kilometers. The US unilaterally suspended the agreement in February of this year, prompting Russia to do the same. In August, the US formally withdrew from the agreement. Commenting on the events, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in August that Russia will now develop and make missiles covered by the defunct treaty, but will not deploy them unless the US does it first.

    "articleText": "Syria welcomes pullout of Kurdish armed groups to depth of 30 km from Turkish border – First published … October 27, 2019 – Damascus welcomes the withdrawal of Kurdish armed groups in Syria’s northwestern regions to a depth of 30 kilometers from the Turkish border as part of a Russia-Turkey deal, saying the pullout rids Ankara of the pretext to keep up its acts of aggression against the Arab country. On Sunday, an official source at Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said in a statement, carried by Syria’s official news agency SANA, that the withdrawal was carried out “through direct cooperation with the Syrian army.” “The Syrian Arab Republic affirms that this withdrawal ends the basic pretext of the brutal Turkish aggression on its territories,” said the statement. The ministry added that Syria belongs to all national groups, and that the Arab country is ready to embrace all of its citizens with open arms. Damascus, it said, would work on “embracing its citizens and providing the aid for them in a way that would guarantee their integration into the Syrian society again and would open the door for all to return to the Syrian national unity as one land and [one] people.” The statement came shortly after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said it had agreed to move back 30 kilometers from the Turkish border as part of the groundbreaking deal struck last Tuesday between Turkey and Russia in Sochi aimed at ending Ankara’s military offensive against the Kurdish militants in northern Syria. The deal gave the Kurds a 150-hour deadline for withdrawal, which will expire on Tuesday. “The SDF is redeploying to new positions away from the Turkish-Syrian border across northeast Syria in accordance with the terms of the agreement in order to stop the bloodshed and to protect the inhabitants of the region from Turkish attacks,” the militant group said in a statement. The Turkish army launched the offensive on October 9 in an attempt to cleanse Syria’s northern border areas of Kurdish militants from the so-called People’s Protection Units (YPG) — which the SDF’s main component. Ankara regards the YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militant group, which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984. The military operation came after the US abruptly pulled out its forces of the region, clearing the path for Turkey to go ahead with a planned military action against Washington’s longtime Kurdish allies. Feeling backstabbed by the US, the Kurdish militants — which were until recently operating against the Syrian government — reached out to Damascus in a dramatic shift, agreeing to allow national army forces back into several northern regions under their control to help defend the country’s borders against Turkey’s incursion. In its Sunday statement, the SDF called on Russia to help ensure “a constructive dialog” between the Kurds and the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The statement came a day after Erdogan vowed to “clear” Kurdish “terrorists” from the so-called safe zone single-handedly if they fail to withdraw by the end of the Tuesday deadline. The Turkish military has previously launched two cross-border incursions in northern Syria, namely the Euphrates Shield in August 2016 and the Olive Branch in January 2018, with the declared aim of eradicating Kurdish militants and Daesh Takfiri terrorists near Turkey’s borders.

    "description": "Let's stop the cruel and childish hostage-taking and start behaving civilly toward Iran.",
    "articleText": "Press TV interview with Kevin Barrett, Veterans Today Editor Dr. Masoud Soleimani, who has been illegally imprisoned in the United States since October last year, is being used as a political pawn by US neoconservatives, Zionists who are hostile towards the Islamic Republic of Iran, according to Dr. Kevin Barrett. Barrett said that Dr. Soleimani “should be protected by habeas corpus,” which is a writ requiring a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, especially to secure the person’s release unless lawful grounds are shown for his detention. Barrett, an author, journalist and radio host with a Ph.D. in Islamic and Arabic Studies, made the remarks in an interview with Press TV while commenting on the year-long incarceration by police in the United States. Dr. Soleimani’s family has condemned the imprisonment of the Iranian stem cell scientist as a “hostile” and “inhumane act” meant to pressure Iran’s government, calling for his immediate release. Speaking during a press briefing at Press TV’s headquarters in Tehran on Tuesday, Soleimani’s wife, Dr. Mahnaz Rabeie, censured the US for keeping the scientist behind bars for an entire year without any fair trial. Rabeie rejected a claim that her husband had been arrested for violating US sanctions against Iran, saying the incarceration was politically motivated. PressTV- US jailing without trial of Iran scientist inhumane: Family Dr. Someilani’s family attend a news briefing organized by Press TV in Tehran to mark one year since the scientist was imprisoned in the US in the absence of a fair trial. Commenting on this Dr. Barrett said, “Dr. Masoud Soleimani, who is a respected Iranian biological scientist, was lured to the United States in order to set him for a completely bogus arrest on false pretenses for supposedly violating sanctions on Iran.” “And he has been held without any due process, essentially disappeared in this banana republic for a year now. His family is naturally in a kind of panic and suffering. And this is tremendous injustice. It is obviously purely political,” he stated. “What he is accused of doing is not itself a violation of sanctions. He is accused of having been involved in bringing of a small amount of non-commercial biological material — with no weapons use whatsoever — to Iran, a small amount of experimental biological material and that for medical research, and medical materials like that are specifically excluded from Iran sanctions. So that’s probably why they are not bringing him to trial because they don’t have a case,” he noted. “And it just illustrates how the rule of law has gone the wayside since the false flag event of September 11, 2001 which was specifically designed not only to create permanent hostility against the entire Middle East region on behalf of Israel but also to take down the United States constitution and the rule of law so that the gangster oligarchs can do anything they want without having to be worried about any legal issues,” he said. “And so Dr. Soleimani who is a totally respected, an utterly clean man with a perfect record, no criminal record whatsoever, not even accused of doing anything involved in politics or US-Iranian relations, he is only accused of shipping a very small amount of experimental medical material for medical research with no possible nefarious usage. He’s being made a political pawn to this neoconservative hostility towards Iran, the neoconservative Zionists, who are allied with the Netanyahu Likudnic element of the Israeli power structure are dedicated to stir this endless hostility between the United States and Iran,” Dr. Barrett said. “Dr. Soleimani should be protected by habeas corpus, that is you just can’t disappear people in a country that respects human rights; you have to charge them quickly with something and given the chance to defend themselves. And they are not doing that. They are just kidnapping him, presumably to try to put pressure on Tehran and possibly to use him in some kind of a prisoner swap,” he observed. Dr. Soleimani arrived in the US on October, 22, 2018 with a visa issued upon an invitation by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to lead a research program on the treatment of stroke patients. He was, however, arrested by the FBI, which had a secret indictment, upon arrival at the Chicago airport. His visa was canceled and he was transferred to a jail in Atlanta, Georgia. PressTV-US jailing of top scientist ‘pressure tool against Iran’ The sanctions violation charges leveled by the US against Iranian stem cell scientist Dr. Masoud Soleimani are a mere “excuse” to justify his illegal imprisonment. Soleimani’s whereabouts remained unknown for up to a week until the Chicago airport police claimed that the professor had returned to Iran on a Qatari flight, according to statement issued by his family on Tuesday. Prosecutors have accused Soleimani, who works in stem cell research, hematology and regenerative medicine, and two of his former students of conspiring and attempting to export growth hormone vials from the US to Iran without authorization, in violation of American sanctions. They had secretly obtained an indictment against Soleimani in June 2018, prior to his arrival on US soil. Lawyers for the scientists say no specific license was required for the attempted transport because the hormones are medical materials and that bringing them to Iran for non-commercial purposes does not amount to exporting goods. The hormone, which is a form of synthetic protein, is not banned in the US or Iran and is being used exclusively for medical research. Loading...

    "articleText": "by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio for VT Italy BREAKING NEWS – AL BAGHDADI IS ALIVE Isis Abu Bakr al Baghdadi leader was killed during an American raid in Syria. This was announced by US president Donald Trump from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room. “He died after escaping from a dead end, crying and screaming. Al Baghdadi blew himself up and killed three of his sons who were with him,” Trump announced. According to the president, 11 young children had been moved out of the compound to safety. However, three children were said to have died after Baghdadi dragged them into the tunnel with him and blew up a suicide vest while pursued by a US K9 unit. “His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him,” Trump said. Is Al Baghdadi really dead? In the coming days there will be much to talk about. The Us president is used to lying and therefore it would not be surprising if he even did so on a news of such great importance as the killing of the Caliph of the Islamic State. In fact, how does Trump say that one who was blown up with an explosive jacked was identified with certainty??? The doubt is legitimate because it seems above all a well-orchestrated intelligence operation managed by the Pentagon and the CIA, leaked indiscretions to friendly media, to create havoc in Syria where Washington and the American president Donald Trump made the figure of the incapable, in the defeating Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, but also criminals in financing and arming jihadists. But the US also proved to be thieves, of Syrian oil as evidenced by many proofs exhibited by the Russian Defense Ministry, and in recent weeks even traitors of the Kurdish allies of the SDF militias left at the mercy of the mercenaries possessed in the service of the invasion of Turkey. Here, then, that the blitz against the most wanted terrorist in the world – but never from the CIA or NATO – represents a masterstroke of that mediocre comedian who is Trump, perfect interpreter of the “Theatrocracy” theorized by Platone in unsuspected times. Whether suicide is true or false, whether or not the death of Al Baghdadi is demonstrable it matters little to American intelligence that it has returned to the center of world attention. The stone at the dovecote was thrown. Now we just have to wait for the followers of the Islamic State to take up arms again in order to justify new chaos in the Middle East and in particular in Iraq. THE NEWS OF SUICIDE ON WORLD’s MEDIA «Notorious Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a US military operation in northwest Syria, according to reports. He supposedly detonated a suicide vest during the raid». Russia Today reports a few hours ago. «It is said that during the US mission – involving choppers, warplanes and drones – American troops engaged in a firefight with the terrorist. At a certain point, al-Baghdadi detonated the vest, multiple outlets, including ABC and Defense One, said citing sources. Later on Saturday, Iraqi state TV announced it will air the footage of the reported raid» adds RT. Meanwhile, in an apparent reference to the news, a commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Mazloum Abdi, tweeted about the “successful, historic operation as a result of joint intelligence work with the US.” According to a senior Pentagon official familiar with the operation and Army official briefed on the matter, a “high value ISIS (Daesh) target” – believed to be Baghdadi – was targeted during a top-secret operation in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province on Saturday. The senior Pentagon official told Newsweek that a brief firefight happened when US forces entered the compound, but then Baghdadi killed himself by detonating a suicide vest.The Defense Department told the White House they had “high confidence” that the target killed was Baghdadi, who was thought for some time was hiding somewhere in Syria, but along the border with Iraq, therefore in the eastern part of the country, hundreds of kilometers away from where the blitz would have occurred instead. US President Donald Trump, who approved the mission nearly a week before it took place, posted on saturday night a Twitter message hinting at “very big” news. Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) leader has been in hiding for several years. Footage distributed by the terrorist group in April of 2019 purported to show him sitting on the ground with a Kalashnikov assault rifle next to him. Before that, al-Baghdadi was last seen in a video from July 2014, when he spoke at the Great Mosque in Mosul. AL BAGHDADI – THE SECRET HISTORY The suspicion that he was a CIA and Mossad agent, as claimed by multiple OSINT sources, always hovers over him. The Syrian Arab News Agency is still cautious, recalling embarrassing details: «Many media outlets have mentioned that the Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has admitted in her memoirs that a number of Western states including the US are the responsible ones for establishing and funding Daesh (ISIS) terrorist organization and supplying it with weapons» has written Sana. «In case the story of killing al-Baghdadi is confirmed, many questions will be also raised on the goal behind the operation, particularly after the role of the US in supporting the terrorist organizations throughout many chapters of the terrorist war on Syria has become well-known, on top supporting Daesh terrorists in the face of the Syrian Arab Army – adds Syrian pro-government agency – The killing of al-Baghdadi at the hands of the US forces doesn’t mean that the US hasn’t participated in creating terrorist organizations to undermine the stability of some states or in supporting». Certainly this news is an excellent opportunity for President Trump to make us forget all the scandals that are upsetting the White House but above all the double dirty game he has been playing in Syria for years. The American military operation is still shrouded in mystery also because it would have happened, the conditional is a must when Pentagon and CIA act, in the province of Idlib disputed between the HTS jihadists (ex Qaedists of Front Al Nusra) armed by Turkey and the Arab-Syrian army of President Bashar Al Assad supported by Russia. The blitz happens when the US military left its bases in the North East (near Kobane and Manbji) paving the way for the Turkish armed forces of the Islamic dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan who invaded Rojava, the Syrian region administered by the Kurds thanks to the support of the fierce jihadists of various gangs of Sunni Muslim extremists, enemies of the Shiites who support the Damascus government. Neither the agreement of the American vice president Pence nor that of the Russian president Vladimir Putin defined with Erdogan was sufficient to stop the Turkish aggression that with airplanes, drones, tanks he continued the offensive together with his Islamic mercenaries. This is denounced on several occasions by the Kurdish media ANHA, which has charged dozens of truce violations and civilian massacres to Turkey and its militants. read more – THE TURKS INVASION GOES ON Not only. Washington troops moved to the Euphrates Valley, in the provinces of Hasaka and Deir Ezzor, with the motivation to reinforce the defenses around the oil wells in the area, from which the Americans illegally draw oil to smuggle it with the help of Turkey. But the US military, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency, has also transported about 300 ISIS prisoners to Iraq at a very delicate time for this country in which the capital Baghdad and other cities have been occupied by a popular revolution that appears to be in all similar to that of the Cedars in Lebanon in 2005 and to that attempted in Syria for the regime-change against Assad. THE MILITARY OPERATION DURING THE IRAQI UNRESTS It looks like the typical clandestine military operation that develops with crowd agitators reinforced by unscrupulous armed militias like those of ISIS. read more JIHADIST FACTIONS ARMED BY US WITH TOW MISSILES This is why the elimination of Al Baghdadi at this time, whether true or false, but impossible to deny, could be the fuse that triggers a new revolt by the Black Flag jihadists of Daesh to allow Sunni Arab countries to regain control of the Iraq, administered by a Shiite government and increasingly allied with Iran, the sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia, where the protest action would have started. Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Seyed Ali Sistani On media FarsNews Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Seyed Ali Sistani warned against the infiltration of agents with malevolent intentions into public protests in the Arab country, calling upon demonstrators and security forces to keep anti-occupation rallies peaceful. Don’t let those with vicious intentions to infiltrate among you and attack security forces,” the official representative of Ayatollah Sistani in Iraq Abdul Mahdi al-Karbalai said on Friday, conveying a message of the senior cleric. He added that public protest is a right enshrined in the Constitution, and warned that, however, protests should not be used as a pretext for vandalizing public properties or injuring security forces. The protests that started early in this month subsided after the public get engaged in holding the annual massive march of Arbaeen, but restored friday after religious rituals of the second month of the Islamic calendar were over. According to FarsNews, in the first round of public protests 3 weeks ago, analyses revealed that 79% of hashtags about protests in Iraq on Twitter originated from Saudi Arabia and only 6% were from Iraq, in a stark contrast with claims that the demonstrations were popular and spontaneous. An international conspiracy already seen in Syria with a massacre of over half a million people who have not yet stopped: for the delight of American oil smugglers and the International Arms Lobby.

    "articleText": "Introduction: Three years ago, Russian aerospace forces, over a period of weeks, destroyed ISIS oil production. From Russia Today: “Russia, citing satellite imagery, says the United States has been smuggling Syrian oil to other countries under the protection of its troops before and after the defeat of the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region.” In video’s below, thousands of tanker trucks will be seen. All of them were shipped from the US, bought used by companies and we suspect Haliburton and Bechtel, but have no solid testimony as yet, and shipped through Saudi Arabia and Jordan on behalf of ISIS. Then things changed, the US came in on the ground in the same region where Russia bombed, and the ISIS/US oil program began again as it is going on now. The US is currently moving tanks into Syria to secure oil facilities where hundreds of new tanker trucks, shipped from the US through Turkey, are now loading stolen Syrian oil into Turkey on behalf of the Trump family and ISIS. The development comes after Washington decided to withdraw US troops from northeastern Syria following the start of a Turkish military operation against Kurdish forces on October 9. A column of US troops has returned to northeastern Syria’s al-Hasakah Province from Iraq, Syria TV reports. The news outlet claimed that “the column of American occupation forces entered […] the province through the illegal al-Walid border crossing” and that the column, which includes “dozens of soldiers and military hardware” is covered by US combat helicopters. This comes a day after US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that the US would maintain a “reduced presence” in Syria, citing concerns about Daesh* terrorists taking control of nearby oil fields. Almost two weeks ago, Esper pledged that the US would withdraw all of its force of 1,000 soldiers from northeastern Syria, after Turkey launched its military operation in the area to drive Kurdish militias and remaining Daesh militants away from the border. Russia Concerned Over US Military Returning to Northern Syria Commenting on Esper’s statement that some US troops will remain in north-eastern Syria, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that the statement did not come as a surprise. “What Washington does now – the capture and holding under its armed control of oil fields in Eastern Syria is, simply speaking, international state banditism,” he stressed, adding that Syrian oil reserves and other mineral resources belong solely to the Syrian Arab Republic, not to Daesh or to “American protectors from Daesh terrorists”. He also said that “neither international law, nor the American legislation itself can justify the US troops’ goal to guard Syrian hydrocarbon reserves from Syria itself and its people.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov suggested that the fresh contradictory signals the US has sent regarding Syria may indicate Washington’s desire to maintain conditions that allow for continued pressure on Damascus. “We are very definitely worried that the signals from the White House may reflect the same attitude: to preserve the conditions for continuing multi-component pressure on the legitimate authorities in Damascus”, he pointed out, adding that “this is the moment we don’t agree and we can’t agree with the United States on the situation.” He said that Moscow “would not like new complications” on the Syria issue, touting the work that “has been done at the level of the leadership of Russia and Turkey in recent days.” “The results of the negotiations in Sochi should not tempt anyone to reformat or change something again,” Ryabkov emphasised. Russia, Turkey Agree on Northern Syria as Ankara Halts Its Military Op Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US Vice President Mike Pence clinched the five-day ceasefire in northern Syria on 17 October to allow for the withdrawal of the Kurdish fighters; it was followed by talks between Erdogan and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi and Ankara’s announcement that the ceasefire will be permanent. Putin and Erdogan agreed that Russian military police and Syrian border guards would facilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish militia from an 18-mile safe zone on the Syria-Turkey border within 150 hours. On 9 October, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria to clear the area of Kurdish forces and Daesh terror group militants. © AFP 2019 / DELIL SOULEIMAN Civilians ride a pickup truck as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment on Syria’s northeastern town of Ras al-Ain in the Hasakeh province along the Turkish border on October 9, 2019 Turkey considers the Kurdish YPG, which comprises the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a terrorist organisation, claiming that the SDF is related to the domestic Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The Turkish offensive has faced widespread condemnation from across the globe, with Damascus slamming it as a violation of its sovereignty and deploying troops to the northeast of the Arab Republic to help Kurds repel the offensive. Several countries, including the US, Germany and the UK announced an embargo on weapons exports to Turkey over the move. Loading...

You cannot prevent ISIS cells from planting IEDs along the roads unless you are patrolling. The refugees from the area cannot return if there are any visible threats to them by marauding jihadis. Once they have resettled, they become part of the security structure, in terms of being able to have more eyes looking for infiltrators from outside the local area. These troops all look like regular SAA personnel, but I suspect that regular police units will come behind them, along with communications and local headquarter staffing needed to keep Damascus informed. Chaos is designed to create blind spots for exploitation. The SAA is methodically working to normalize these areas to peacetime security levels, something achievable if coordinated with SDF manpower. That will leave more regular Syrian Army troops to be the mobile reserve that the country needs to be able to nip in the bud any future trouble spots created by the remaining ISIS cells, the “ISIS pretenders” from various US-coalition special operations branches. Syria’s progress with the Constitutional Committee and making consistent headway toward future elections after Idlib is retaken will all be based on its success at maintaining security for returning refugees. One of the ways the US tries to undermine the process is by hijacking the country’s revenue. Having refugees return to places with no infrastructure or jobs is a dead-on-arrival program, a goal of the US coalition… Jim W. Dean ] More Syrian troops are taking control of security in their country – First published … October 26, 2019 – Additional troops of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) were deployed on October 26 in the northern al-Hasakah countryside as a part of the recent agreement between the Damascus government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). According to the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), SAA troops entered several villages between the town of Tell Tamr and the border town of Ras al-Ayn, including: al-Qasmiyah, al-Rashidiyah, al-Dawdiyah, al-Aziziyah, al-Sibatiyah, al-Jamiliyah, al-Dahrah, Khrbat al-Dibs and Umm Kayif. The state-run news agency reported that SAA forces reached the countryside of Ras al-Ayn, occupied by Turkish-backed militants earlier this month, and the border with Turkey. A day earlier, the SAA began deploying troops along the Turkish border west of the border city of Qamishli, 100 km to the east of Having refugees returns to places with no infrastructure or jobs is a dead on arrival program, which is exactly what the US coalition wants.

    "articleText": "276 more Russian Military Police officers and 33 additional equipment pieces will be deployed in Syria, Russia’s state media reported. These forces will likely participate in security operations along the Syrian-Turkish border to the east of the Euphrates River. Additionally to the deployment in Kobane, the Russian Military Police already started carrying out patrols near the city of Qamishly. On October 24, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin announced that Kurdish forces had started withdrawal from the border area. Nonetheless, the implementation of the ceasefire is not going without difficulties. On October 24 afternoon, the Syrian Army repelled an attack by Turkish-backed militants near the villages of al-Kozleya and Tell al-Laban in northern al-Hasakah. Clashes between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Turkish-backed groups also took place near the villages of Assadiya, Mishrafa and Manajer. Pro-Turkish sources say that these attacks were conducted in response to ceasefire violations by Kurdish militias. The Turkish Defense Ministry revealed that 5 soldiers were injured in the Syrian province of al-Hasakah on October 24 in a series of attacks by Kurdish forces. However, the official Turkish version claims that its forces do not violate the ceasefire regime. The SDF are ready to discuss the idea of joining the Syrian military once a political solution is reached in the war-torn country, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led group, Mustafa Bali, told Russian media. Bali claimed that “all parties must recognize that there is a political crisis that needs to be resolved by political means”. This kind of statements is quite different from the language of ultimatums, which the SDF used when US troops were present in northern Syria. This change indicates that a political solution is in fact can be reached. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "The military crisis in northeastern Syria started by the Turkish military offensive on Kurdish militias amid the US troops withdrawal deflated. On October 23, Turkey, Russia and Syria started implementing the ‘safe zone’ agreement reached by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier. Units of the Russian Military Police deployed in the border town of Kobani. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Syrian Army will establish a total of 15 observation posts on the Turkish-Syrian border to the east of the Euphrates. The next steps are the withdrawal of Kurdish YPG units and their heavy weapons from the agreed buffer zone and the start of joint Russian-Turkish patrols. Meanwhile, the Turkish Defense Ministry announced that Operation Peace Spring in northeastern Syria does not need to be expanded and that there is no need to carry out any new operations because the main goals had been achieved. Turkish sources say that some YPG fighters, that they call “terrorists”, may remain in the area, but do not expect large-scale military actions. Members of the Turkish-backed coalition of militant groups, the Syrian National Army, remain in the captured areas between Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The Iranian Foreign Ministry described the Russian-Turkish agreement as a positive move to reach a stability in Syria. The ministry recalled that Iran has always supported political measures to settle the conflict. The United States, that are finalizing the main phase of the troops withdrawal, also seem to be satisfied with the outcome of the situation. During an October 23 press conference, President Donald Trump took a credit for the de-escalation in northeastern Syria, praised the ceasefire and announced that his administration was removing sanctions imposed on Turkey in response to its military action against Kurdish forces. The US President also confirmed that a “small number” of US troops would remain in the area “where they have the oil.” Actions of Syria, the United States, Russia and Turkey demonstrate that all the key sides of the conflict accept the deal over northeastern Syria and move forward in the direction of a possible political settlement. The separatist faction within the Kurdish political and armed groups of northern Syria suffered a major blow. The only side unhappy with the outcome is Israel that strongly condemned Turkey’s actions and publicly supported the Kurdish separatism in Syria and Iraq as a tool against its never-ending campaign against the expanding Iranian influence. The US military presence in the al-Tanf border area is likely a goodwill gesture of Trump to his Israeli partners. In the current conditions, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, and therefore Kurdish militias and political factions, have the only option – to be reintegrated into the modern Syria. Moscow already warned them that if they decline to fulfil the safe-zone deal the Russians and the Syrian Army will have to open a way for the Turkish military machine that will crush them. The YPG-led partisan war against the Damascus government and attempts to push the Syrian Army back from the provinces of Raqqah and Hasakah by military means is unlikely scenario. If the Kurdish leaders attempt to play this scenario, a vast majority of the Syrians, including the so-called ‘moderate opposition’, will consider them to be a bigger threat than ever ISIS. In the coming months the situation in northern Syria will remain mostly stable. However, after the 2019-2020 winter, it’s expected that factions affiliated with the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) will step up terrorist activity in northern Syria, mainly the area of Afrin, and Kurdish-populated parts of Turkey Southeastern and Eastern Anatolia Regions. Big Turkish cities, like Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir and Gaziantep, may also become places of strident PKK attacks. The main targets will be personnel and facilities affiliated with the Army, the Gendarmerie General Command and Police. However, even in the event of success, such kind of activity will not force the Erdogan government to make cardinal changes in its policies towards Syria and the PKK-linked groups. Another point of possible instability is Greater Idlib, where al-Qaeda affiliated militant groups still present along with the Turkish-backed ‘opposition’. The Damascus government and its allies repeatedly stated that the Idlib de-escalation agreement does not include terrorists. So, Ankara will have to neutralize them in its zone of responsibility or the Syrian Army will come to do so, like it was done in northern Hama in August. Loading...

Click to donate >> – First published … October 24, 2019 – In the afternoon of October 24, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) repelled an attack by Turkish-backed militants on its newly-established positions in the northern al-Hasakah countryside. “The SAA repelled an attack by Turkish occupation forces and their mercenaries on the villages of al-Kozleya and Tell al-Laban in Tal Tamr countryside,” a short press release by the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reads. The failed attack was likely launched by the so-called National Syrian Army (NSA). A few hours ago, the Turkish-backed group began a fresh offensive on the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northern al-Hasakah. Some pro-government activists claimed that several Syrian service members were killed or injured while repelling the attack. However, this is yet to be confirmed. The SAA began deploying troops in northern al-Hasakah and other parts of the country’s northeast region a few weeks ago under an agreement with the SDF. The initial agreement is aimed at countering the growing Turkish threat. The NSA’s attacks in northern al-Hasakah are a violation of the Turkish agreements with Russia and the U.S. If Turkish-backed militants continue to carry out such attacks, the region could witness a serious escalation very soon.

    "articleText": "The current military and diplomatic situation in the Middle East demonstrates that the capability and quality of air defense forces is especially important for states operating in a tense geopolitical environment. Saudi Arabia with Patriot surface-to-air missiles appeared to be unable to defend itself from missile and drone attacks by the Houthis. Thus, the Kingdom lost its remaining chances to achieve a military victory in the Yemeni war and resumed negotiations with the Houthis. Devastated by the war on terrorism, Syria and Iraq are suffering from regular Israeli strikes carried out under a pretext of combating the so-called Iranian threat. The Trump administration strongly supports these actions and together with its Israeli counterparts fuel the anti-Iranian hysteria to justify its own policies in the region. In a recent interview to Jerusalem Post, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that Israel has a “fundamental right” to bomb what it wants to “ensure” its own “security”. In the event of a new round of tensions in the Persian Gulf, Iran’s ability to defend its territory from a possible aerial attack will be one of the factors shaping the course of the possible escalation. The Islamic Republic already demonstrated its air defense capability on June 20, 2019, when forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk BAMS-D surveillance drone that violated Iranian airspace near the Strait of Hormuz. Iran says that the Global Hawk was downed with its developed surface-to-air missile (SAM) system Khordad-3. As a part of its multi-layered air defense, Iran employs a variety of short-, medium- and long-range systems. Earlier, the core of Iran’s air defense was foreign-made systems, including Russian, Chinese, and even US models. Today, Iranian air defense actively employs domestically produced systems. Most of foreign systems were locally modernized. The most capable foreign air defense system acquired by Iran is the Russian-made S-300, the delivery of which was completed in 2016. The most-widely known Iranian indigenous SAMs are the Bavar-373, the Khordad-15 and the Khordad-3. The Bavar-373 is a multi-channel long-range SAM system created in Iran. According to the Iranian military, the system has a range of up to 200 km and altitude of up to 27 km. It is reportedly capable of hitting stealth air targets, cruise missiles and even warheads of ballistic missiles. Official Teheran says that the Bavar-373 is superior to the Russian S-300 and only slightly inferior to the S-400. In 2019, Iran unveiled the medium-range SAM system Khordad-15. The system is capable of detecting fighter jets, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles in a range of 150km and track them within a range of 120 km. The Sayyad-3 missile, employed by the system, has a range of 200 km. The Khordad-15 reportedly can detect stealth targets in a distance of 85 km and can intercept and destroy them within a range of 45km. There are more SAM systems of Iranian design: Talash and Raad. Each unit of the Talash system includes three vehicles, a truck carrying Patriot-style missile launchers and two command and control vehicles. The Talash-1 is employed for low and medium altitudes, the Talash-2 – for medium to high altitudes, and the Talash-3 – for high and very high altitudes. The Talash-2 can engage targets at a range of up to 120 km, and an altitude of up to 27km. Some sources say that the Talash concept originates from the Patriot. The Raad SAM family externally resembles the Russian Buk and Buk M2 systems. According to Iranian sources, it is designed to confront hostile aircraft, cruise missiles, smart bombs, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The system’s Taer-2 missiles can trace and hit targets in ranges up to 50 km and in altitudes of up to 25-27 km. Another missile employed by the SAM is the Sayyad-2. It has a range of 75km and a top altitude of 30. The most modern version of this SAM system is the Khorad-3 employed against the US Global Hawk in June. The development of these systems is the visible demonstration of successes of the Iranian military industrial complex. Pro-Iranian sources say that Iran successfully joined the United States, China and Russia in the club of the countries capable of producing effective long-range SAM systems. However, the tactical and technical data of the latest Iranian SAMs that are presented in the open press is very limited, and there are almost no data on the probability of interception of various types of targets. The degree of protection of Iranian SAMs from electronic warfare also remains a question. Accordingly, their real combat capabilities in the event of an armed conflict with a high-tech enemy cannot be estimated using the existing data. Another question is how successful can Iran’s multi-layered air defense be against combined drone, ballistic and cruise missiles strikes that Saudi Arabia experienced during the past years. Representatives of the Trump administration, including the US president himself, repeatedly threatened Iran with a military action. However, no threats were ever turned into reality, even in a form of a symbolic move like the US missile strike on Syria’s Sharyat airfield. The US stance of empty threats and symbolic gestures is likely not a result the powerful Iranian air-defenses nor Washington’s attempts to avoid an open military escalation in the region. During the years of sanction pressure and military threats, Iran developed a complex asymmetric warfare doctrine. This doctrine provided the Iranian leadership with a number of means and measures that it can employ to deliver a painful blow to its adversaries, which consist primarily of the Israeli-US-Saudi alliance. Therefore, the cost of a military aggression against the Islamic Republic in the current conditions appears to be too high for sides that could be involved. Loading...

    "articleText": "al Baghdadi (left) photograhed with an American political leader …by Nauman Sadiq, VT Islamabad Islamic State’s self-styled Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a United States Special Ops overnight raid Saturday involving helicopters, warplanes and a ground clash on the Turkey-Syria border while fleeing Syria’s northwestern Idlib Governorate, Reuters and Newsweek are reporting, and President Trump is set to make the major announcement of the biggest symbolic victory of his administration in the war against terrorism soon. [ Editor’s Note: The video below is a classic “double pop” which is typically used on high value targets. The target is stationary would have been lit up by a laser or if moving would have had homing devise used to track it. The later were used by Russia Spetnaz, when eliminating much of the ISIS leadership in Aleppo for a month before the main ground push to take the city… Jim W. Dean ] What’s worth noting in the news reports about the killing of al-Baghdadi is the fact that although the mainstream media had been trumpeting for the last several years that the Islamic State chief had been hiding somewhere on the Iraq-Syria border in the east, he was found hiding in the northwestern Idlib Governorate, under the control of Turkey’s militant proxies and al-Nusra Front, and was killed while trying to flee to Turkey in Brisha village on the Syria border. Reuters reports [1]: “Two Iraqi security sources and two Iranian officials said they had received confirmation from inside Syria that Baghdadi had been killed. ‘Our sources from inside Syria have confirmed to the Iraqi intelligence team tasked with pursuing Baghdadi that he has been killed alongside his personal bodyguard in Idlib after his hiding place was discovered when he tried to get his family out of Idlib toward the Turkish border,’ one of the Iraqi officials said.” The reason why the mainstream media scrupulously avoided mentioning Idlib as al-Baghdadi’s most likely hideout in Syria was to cover up the collusion between the militant proxies of Turkey and the jihadists al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State. At its peak in 2014, when the Islamic State declared its “caliphate” in Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, the Islamic State reportedly had more than 70,000 jihadists. The divisions within the rank and file of the terrorist organization seem to be growing as it has lost all of its territory, and thousands of Islamic State’s jihadists have been killed in airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition against the Islamic State and the ground offensives by the Iraqi armed forces and allied militias in Iraq and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria. Furthermore, due to frequent desertions and detention of hundreds of hardcore militants alongside thousands of innocent Arab villagers held captive by the Kurds in northeastern Syria, the number of fighters within the Islamic State’s ranks has evidently dwindled. But a question would naturally arise in the minds of perceptive observers of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that where did the remaining tens of thousands of Islamic State’s jihadists vanish? The riddle can be easily solved, though, if we bear in mind the fact that although Idlib Governorate in Syria’s northwest has firmly been under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led by al-Nusra Front since 2015, its territory was equally divided between Turkey-backed rebels and al-Nusra Front. In a brazen offensive in January, however, al-Nusra Front’s jihadists completely routed Turkey-backed militants, even though the latter were supported by a professionally trained and highly organized military of a NATO member, Turkey. And al-Nusra Front now reportedly controls more than 70% territory in the Idlib Governorate. The reason why al-Nusra Front has been easily able to defeat Turkey-backed militants appears to be that the ranks of al-Nusra Front have now been swelled by highly motivated and battle-hardened jihadist deserters from the Islamic State after the fall of the latter’s “caliphate” in Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. The merger of al-Nusra Front and Islamic State in Idlib doesn’t come as a surprise, though, since the Islamic State and al-Nusra Front used to be a single organization before a split occurred between the two militant groups in April 2013 over a leadership dispute. In fact, al-Nusra Front’s chief Abu Mohammad al-Jolani was reportedly appointed [2] as the emir of al-Nusra Front by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State, in January 2012. Regarding the nexus between Islamic jihadists and so-called “moderate rebels” in Syria, while the representatives of Free Syria Army (FSA) were in Washington in January last year, soliciting the Trump administration to restore the CIA’s “train and equip” program for the Syrian militants that was shuttered in July 2017, hundreds of Islamic State’s jihadists joined the moderate militants in Idlib in their battle against the advancing Syrian government troops backed by Russian airstrikes to capture the strategically important Abu Duhur airbase, according to a January last year’s AFP report [3] authored by Maya Gebeily. The Islamic State already had a foothold in neighboring Hama province and its foray into Idlib was an extension of its outreach. The Islamic State reportedly captured several villages and claimed to have killed two dozen Syrian soldiers and taken twenty hostages. And on January 12 last year, the Islamic State officially declared Idlib one of its “Islamic emirates,” according to the aforementioned AFP report. In all likelihood, some of the Islamic State’s jihadists who joined the battle in Idlib in January last year were part of the same contingent of thousands of Islamic State militants that fled Raqqa in October 2017 under a deal brokered [4] by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

    "articleText": "…by Dr. Abdullah Manaz[1]Veterans Today, Turkey There is a proverb in the Middle East: “If you make very good molasses well, its fly comes from Baghdad.” We know that the US is working to establish a Unipolar World Order after the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to political science, the State is the toppest organization with the authority to use weapons. If you are going to establish a World State, you will need instruments that will be used worldwide. It have to be a Guilty for using a weapon. If you have a weapon and you absolutely want to use it, you can create the culprit yourself. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the culprit needed by the United States was found: Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda Terrorist Organization. We know that Laden served as the CIA logistics officer during the Afghanistan War. Likewise, we know that the US has established the Taliban against organizations like Jamaat al-Islam and Hizb al-Islam, which the United States is working with in the struggle for Afghanistan. When Taliban did not agree the oil pipelines that will later land in the southern seas, The ropes between the US and the Taliban are broken. Osama bin Laden, who combined his power with the Taliban, traveled the entire Islamic world with his Saudi Arabia diplomatic passport and expanded his organization. It would be stupid to think that the CIA and the Saudis were unaware of this organization. For many years, al-Qaeda has carried out actions where that were provided to settle of the US in many strategic regions, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and the Middle East. Than it was also made military interventions and established bases in these regions by the US. The US struggle in Afghanistan for al-Qaeda has been going on for years. In fact, the US does not have a goal of achieving peace in Afghanistan. If peace comes here, the US military will have to return to his country. In this case, the war needs to continue for the US to remain in the region. Only If the US society understands the truth about in this subject and rebels against the death of their children, then the Afghanistan adventure will end. There has been a similar situation in Iraq. The US invaded Iraq under the pretext of al-Qaeda. However, things did not go well and the al- Qaeda militants were organized by the Russian Military Intelligence GRU against the US and showed strong resistance. The deaths of thousands of American soldiers have rebelled the US community, and the Obama administration has finally decided to withdraw from Iraq. Is the US completely withdrawn from Iraq? No … We think that Bush, Obama or Trump are running the United States. We always know also that this is not the case and that US governments are determined by lobbies. The most effective lobby in the US administration is known to everyone: the Israeli Lobby and the New Conservatives. There is also an Oil and Weapon Lobby governing the United States. When politics, oil and weapons come together, an even greater power is formed. Israel also needs oil and water in the region, but the most important concern is Existence and Security. For years, Israel has been working for the instability of its neighbors and the region to preserve its existence and stability. Since it cannot remain incapable its power, it also needs global power and arms such as the United States. The United States has no historical ties to Mesopotamia, nor will it carry water from the Euphrates and Tigris to the United States. But for the Zionists and the Evangelists, these areas are the Promised Land. Which is why Daesh Terror Organization was established in these lands. First, the organization seized the largest -Raqqa and Mosul-dams between the Euphrates and the Tigris in the Middle East. Daesh Terrorist Organization has completed its function after transferring all the seized territories to another terrorist organization PKK which is an ally of USA in the region. Efforts to move the Daesh Terrorist Organization to Afghanistan, Iran and Africa also Algeria and Tunisia (for France that is the only western ally of the United States in the Middle East) have failed. Many reports and information have been published on the transport of some Daesh commanders by US helicopters during the departure of the Daesh Terrorist Organization from the Deyrozor-Bagoz area, the last area of domination. Likewise, it is noted that US helicopters assist Daesh to deploy around Bagram, the largest US base in Afghanistan. More important than the reality of such information is the target of Daish actions. All actions of the Daesh Terrorist Organization were for the interests of the US and Israel. One of the most important areas in which Daesh has existed for a long time was the Neva region to the west of the Golan Heights. This region is one of the most strategically important regions for Israel. Israel did not intervene against the Daesh Terrorist Organization in this region, nor did the terrorist organization take any action against Israel. Likewise, the Sinai region, where the Daesh Terrorist Organization still exists, is another most strategic region for Israel. The Daesh presence in Sinai has closed the most important palestinian corridor from Gaza to Egypt. This is in line with the interests of both Israel and the Sisi administration in Egypt. It is interesting that an area limited space, such as Sina, cannot be completely cleared of Daesh. Security concerns of each country can be understood to some extent. For example, a terrorist threat on the border of Turkey constitutes a threat for both Turkey and Europe. On the other hand, for the United States, which is bounded by a natural and difficult-to-overcome buffer zone, such as the ocean on its two sides, and its weak neighbor in the south, such as Mexico, it is difficult to understand that a direct terrorist threat from the region. It is important that terror threats in the Middle East are intensified in oil and energy regions and power transmission lines. Likewise, Somalia and Yemen are the most strategic regions for transporting Gulf oil to Europe. In Somalia, there is no single terrorist group and action in Somaliland and Pundland, which became the sovereignty area of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but it is no coincidence that the Shabab Terrorist Organization is active in and around Mogadishu. Perhaps another important point for the US and its Regional Allies is the oil and gas pipelines to be established between the Middle East and Europe. Transporting oil and gas by sea is now a long and costly task. Therefore, a shorter and more economical Energy Transmission Route should be established outside the Persian Gulf – Aden Gulf – Red Sea – Suez route. This is the Middle East – Mediterranean Route. This is the main reason for the intensified conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The United States is looking to build this new Energy Corridor. Therefore, it neither could not leave Iraq nor leave Syria. Although the the plan that aimed to establish a Kurdish state between the region and Turkey, failed, a Energy Corridor Plan will pass from the south-east of the Euphrates and south Syria to Jordan (and may be to Israel,) are still valid. The United States therefore continues to exist in the Tanif region in southern Syria. As it is known, the latest development in this regard is that Daesh Terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in Idlib. According to the US Department of Defense statement, al-Baghdadi who was going to take his family were killed in the village of Bishra in north of Idlib near the border with Turkey. Interestingly, also there is no body of al-Baghdadi, like Osama bin Laden. The Pentagon claimed to have thrown the body of Laden into the sea and says that al-Baghdadi also detonated the bomb vest. Such allegations may be believed by the US Public and the International Community, but, according to experts, are suspicious and ridiculous. It was said that Laden was living in a villa in Pakistan’s safest Military Intelligence Area for many years. Now it is said that al-Baghdadi crossed the river Euphrates, exceed its long Essed land, passed the bilateral security perimeter around Idlib and come up to the border with Turkey. He was Invisible against Russian and Iranian intelligence In addition, al-Baghdadi is not from Idlib city, he was from Samarra originally in Iraq. After such hard claims, it can be said that: “al-Baghdadi was killed while trying to flee to Turkey in the Turkish border?” The more groundless and ridiculous the claim of ”Spreading Democracy”, which is a fundamental element of the United States Security Strategy Document, also death of al-Baghdadi is extremely unfounded and ridiculous. In the Middle East, the United States has been collaborating with the Zionists who have been conducting attacks and expansion policies for years, the Bedouin Arabs that were still are ruling by the kings now and PKK that is the most bloody terrorist organization in the region. This situation does not fit a big country claiming a New World Order. Within the United States, there are many experts that struggle with Israel, Oil, Arms Lobbies and the Governments they support. Since these experts and old soldiers cannot make their voices heard in the mainstream media, they struggle in their books, universities and the internet and in their blogs such as veteranstoday.com. The world community under the influence of popular culture is still under the control of widespread knowledge. Independent Journalist Jonathan Cook wrote in the past few days: “The Islamic State or Isis did not emerge from anywhere else. It was the creation of twenty-year US intervention entirely in the Middle East. And I don’t even mention the mountains of evidence that the US authorities support their Saudi allies to finance and arm Isis directly – just as their predecessors in Washington help the jihadists to become al-Qaeda with the enthusiasm of expelling the Soviets from the region. It was the US Democrats who helped to develop Isis’ Barbarism.” Scientists, independent intellectuals and journalists should be united against these groups, governments and countries that use Oil, Weapon and Terror as an Existence Tool. One day, the American community will see the realities behind the scenes and, together with the international community, will realize that these articles are truths, not conspiracies.

    "description": "“All of the money being diverted will go to Guaido and his faction, the memo said, to pay for their salaries, airfare, ‘good governance’ training, propaganda, technical assistance for holding elections and other ‘democracy-building’ projects.”",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis Last February, I began to write a number of articles detailing the covert activities of New World Order agents in Venezuela, providing one source after another. A correspondent by the name of “Kai Kieferle” got really angry and declared that “Any reasonable person who actually believes in democracy should be applauding” US organizations supporting various anti-government groups in Venezuela. What was so funny about this whole thing is that Kieferle had previously started sending me what seemed to be endless messages. In one of his responses, he declared: “In your opening paragraph at your latest article at VT you claim Venezuela’s opposition is funded by NWO in the US. Unfortunately you make the claim in a vacuum of information. Can you be more specific? What groups or individuals representing the ‘WO’ are funding Juan Gauido’s party? I’d be interested in seeing if you have any evidence to back up these claims. “Actually I’d be interested, given the complicated structure of Venezuelan opposition parties, if you can also show who in the ‘NWO’ operating in the US is sending money and resources to which opposition parties. I imagine most of your readers are not interested in making sure the information they consume is accurate. You will find the opposite with me.” I responded by saying: “I am really surprised that you would even ask that question, precisely because the argument is pretty straightforward. Washington is essentially a New World Order cell, and when it comes to Venezuela, puppets in Washington have made it clear that they are supporting both Guaido and the opposition party. We have seen this played out before. It is the same thing in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. “The CIA made it very plain that they were supporting ‘rebels’–or terrorists–in Syria. They are supporting Guaido precisely because he is a puppet of the United States as well as Israel. Listen to the title of this article by the Washington Post: ‘The U.S. has quietly supported the Venezuelan opposition for years.’” The Washington Post article specifically says that the Trump administration “indicated it would support a military overthrow of the socialist government headed by President Nicolás Maduro. Second, the administration, alongside two dozen other countries, recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate, interim president of Venezuela…the United States and Venezuela have had an acrimonious relationship for the past 20 years — in part because the United States has long supported the Venezuelan political opposition.”[1] If the correspondent had carefully read the article by the Washington Post, he would have gotten a deeper understanding of how the New World Order has essentially funded the opposition group in Venezuela. The Washington Post continues to say that “Shortly after Hugo Chávez’s initial election in 1998, the U.S.-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED) took the lead in training and guiding political parties on how they might best compete against him. One of the NED’s sub-agencies, the International Republican Institute (IRI), led these efforts… “The IRI sponsored such Republican politicians as Darryl Howard, the executive director of the Oregon Republican Party, and Mike Collins, the former Republican Party press secretary, to travel to Venezuela and meet individually with Venezuelan party leaders from the opposition, offering guidance on how they might electorally defeat Chávez. “IRI members also ran political workshops for party members on issues such as constructing political platforms and reaching out to youth. One IRI contractor who helped facilitate some of these workshops bluntly described their objective to me: to help the opposition “get [their] s— together so they could defeat Chávez. In 2006, the IRI brought five technical specialists to assist the campaign of Manuel Rosales, the opposition’s presidential candidate, to monitor elections on the day of the event.”[2] Sociologist Timothy M. Gill of the University of North Carolina, the author of the Washington Post article, says: “U.S. diplomats, including several ambassadors, also told me how they advised the opposition. One ambassador revealed she ‘met with the opposition — I can’t tell you how many times. I told them they need to come up with a plan and needed to unite. There were 50 opposition parties registered!’ In doing so, she urged the opposition not to splinter its vote and hand Chávez an easy victory.”[3] Professor Gill moves on to reveal more diabolical activities by the United States in Venezuela. “U.S. state agencies also strategized with opposition social movements. These efforts have been led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and, in particular, its Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), a group that often works in war-ravaged countries, currently including Syria and Ukraine. “When I asked a USAID representative why OTI was in Venezuela, he told me that OTI acts as ‘the special forces of the democracy assistance community,’ and it can get aid to groups in countries much more quickly than traditional channels. “USAID/OTI, for instance, initiated a strategy to develop neutral-looking organizations in working-class neighborhoods focused on community initiatives such as participatory democracy. These groups were organized with opposition activists to put Chávez supporters in contact with opposition members to help persuade them to reduce their support for the Venezuelan government.”[4] In short, USAID for the opposition group in Venezuela is well documented. Even back in 2007 the United States established an anti-Chavez student movement. USAID also provided students the necessary tools and ideological materials “to amplify their message, including such basics as paper and microphones, and they organized training seminars to help the students enhance the effectiveness of their movement.”[4] Gill adds: “Outside Caracas, USAID helped students in such regions as Maracaibo, where it funded such efforts as a conference run by students opposed to the Chávez government and paid for airfare for individuals to attend. Over time, the U.S. government assisted the efforts of the anti-Chávez student movement significantly. Many of its members are now high-ranking opposition leaders, including Guaidó, Stalin González and Freddy Guevara.”[5] So the debate of whether the New World Order ideology was supporting both the opposition group as well as Guaido in Venezuela was over long ago. Last July, the LA Times seemed to have put hit the final nail in the head by saying: “The Trump administration plans to divert more than $40 million in humanitarian aid from Central America to the U.S.-backed opposition in Venezuela, according to an internal memo and interviews. “The memo, dated July 11 and obtained by The Times, is a notification to Congress from the U.S. Agency for International Development that the money is going to Venezuela in response to an “exigent” crisis involving U.S. “national interest.” “The U.S. has been an ardent supporter of forces attempting to oust the leftist government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and now recognizes his challenger, opposition leader Juan Guaido, as the legitimate ruler of the besieged nation. “All of the money being diverted will go to Guaido and his faction, the memo said, to pay for their salaries, airfare, ‘good governance’ training, propaganda, technical assistance for holding elections and other ‘democracy-building’ projects.”[6] Where was Kai Kieferle when the article was published? He was nowhere to be found. Why? Well, in his subterranean mind, the US was and perhaps still is spreading “democracy” and “freedom” in Venezuela. That’s what the US has been doing for the better part of twenty years. Don’t we all know by now? In any event, you can’t reason with a person out of an idea which wasn’t born on the basis of reason at all. The sad thing is that while the Trump administration is wasting millions upon millions of dollars in places like Venezuela, places like Los Angeles are riddled with poverty. [1] Timothy M.

    "articleText": "TEHRAN (FNA)- The Russian foreign ministry on Wednesday reiterated its full support for the Syrian government’s right of sovereignty, stressing that all oil wells and facilities in the Northeastern parts of the country should be brought back under the Damascus government’s control. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov stated that Moscow hoped that the Kurds would provide a guarantee that they would pull out from the border zone, as Ankara has stated that Turkey will not be launching a new offensive against Kurdish militias in Northern Syria, following a five-day pause in hostilities and high-level talks in Moscow. Bogdanov reiterated that the Syrian government is the only side entitled to have control over the oil fields in the Northeastern parts of the country. His remarks came after conflicting reports quoting US officials cast doubt over a complete pullout from Syria as they said small contingencies might be kept in Syria to seize control over its oil facilities. President Donald Trump had stated that the US never committed to the security of Kurds in Northern Syria, but his Defense Secretary Mark Esper meanwhile noted that American troops had a job to “secure the oil”. The American leader stated on Monday that they will all be removed and deployed elsewhere in the region before eventually coming home. However, the defense chief noted earlier that some may remain behind to guard Syrian oil fields from possible seizure by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, ISIS or Daesh) or the Syrian government. Fars News Agency@EnglishFars Reviving Destroyed Oil, Gas Fields Begins in Syria’s Raqqa After Years of US Bombardmenthttp://fna.ir/dcmtq7 While Washington claims that the move is in the line with its alleged anti-terror campaign in Syria, analysts see it no more than an excuse to impose control over Syria’s oil revenues, reminding that the US was well informed of the hazards of ISIL’s revival when it abandoned the Kurdish militants and paved the ground for Ankara to conduct its long-waited military incursion into Northern Syria. On the first day of Ankara incursion, fears were growing that thousands of ISIL terrorists may escape from Syrian jails, as Kurdish prison guards were leaving their posts to gear up for fighting back the Turkish military. Days later, the Kurdish militants in Northern Syria claimed that 785 foreigners affiliated with the ISIL terror group managed to escape a camp where they were being held. Yet, the US army never made any move to contain the danger of ISIL breakout in highly volatile regions. Moreover, the United States has a long history of salvation of Takfiri militants, where Syrian government forces and fighters were tightening the noose around the terrorists. Meantime, official news agency SANA has reported that US military forces have reportedly transferred more than 1,500 female members of the ISIL from Syria to neighboring Iraq. The news outlet reported that the US troops have moved the ISIL women from al-Hawl refugee camp, which lies in Syria’s Northeastern province of Hasaka and close to the Syria-Iraq border, to Iraq. Trump has for several times threatened to set prisoners from Europe who joined the terror group in Syria and Iraq free at the EU’s borders if they refuse to take back the captives. Fars News Agency@EnglishFars US Army Continues Retreat to End Presence in Syria [+VIDEO]http://fna.ir/dcn1gx The US and its allies invaded Syria in 2014 under the pretext of fighting terrorism, without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. Damascus has repeatedly accused Washington of carrying out an illegal occupation of its sovereign territory. The Damascus government has reiterated that any foreign troops in Syria is regarded as an occupying force and the Syrian government has the right to take all the needed measures to confront it. n late July, colonel general Sergei Rudskoy, the chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said American private military companies, numbering over 3,500 personnel, are plundering Syrian oil facilities under the cover of the US-led coalition, TASS news agency reported. “Aside from training militants, the US entities in Syria are involved in plundering oil facilities and deposits in the area across the Euphrates that belong to the legitimate Syrian government. Lately, US private military companies have been observed to actively beef up their personnel. Today, the mercenaries of the private military companies in Syria exceed 3,500 people,” Rudskoy noted. The senior Russian general further revealed that US military companies are involved in the illegal production and sale of Syrian crude oil from al-Omar, Conoco and al-Tanak fields. “A criminal scheme of Syrian crude cross-border deliveries is in effect. Actually, Syrian national wealth is being plundered,” Rudskoy added. “All this activity by US private military companies is conducted under the cover of the international anti-terror coalition. In actual fact, this is smuggling business seized by the Americans from Daesh,” the Russian general stated. Rudskoy then accused the United States of providing various Arab and Kurdish militia groups in Northern Syrian with different kinds of ammunition in exchange for assistance in the illegal trafficking of Syrian oil to the Eastern bank of the Euphrates River. Back in March 2018, Sputnik news agency reported that the United States had begun the construction of a large military base in Syria’s Eastern and oil-rich Deir Ezzur province.

    "articleText": "Israeli President Reuven Rivlin (R) shakes hands with retired general Benny Gantz during a press conference as the former tasks the latter with forming a new cabinet, at the presidential compound in Jerusalem al-Quds on October 23, 2019. (Photo by AFP) Israel’s president has asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s political rival, Benny Gantz, to form a coalition government following Netanyahu’s failure to do so. During a press conference in Jerusalem al-Quds on Wednesday evening, President Reuven Rivlin gave the former military chief 28 days to put together a unity government. “I promised to put in place a liberal unity government and that’s what I intend to do,” Gantz said at the news conference. “If and when it’s demanded, I’ll make hard choices in the coming days,” he added. This is the first time in a decade that someone other than Netanyahu will be trying to form a government. If Gantz fails, Israel will have to hold an unprecedented third election in the span of a year, something that seems likely given the divided makeup of Israel’s parliament. “These are fateful days,” said Rivlin after the event. “The urgency of the hour and the challenges that we are facing obligate us to form a government as soon as possible.” Gantz’s Blue and White party received 33 out of 120 Knesset seats in Israel’s September 17 election, followed closely by Netanyahu’s Likud party with 32, both far from securing a majority in parliament. Since Gantz’s bloc of center-left parties was smaller than Netanyahu’s right-wing bloc, Netanyahu became the first person who got the chance to form a coalition. However, the office of Israel’s president announced on Monday that Netanyahu had returned the mandate to form the cabinet to the president due to inability to do so. PressTV-Netanyahu announces failure over cabinet formation The Israeli premier says he cannot establish a new cabinet after failed talks with his political rival. Now, on his path to to form a cabinet, Gantz needs to make a deal with the Arab parties and the regime’s former minister of military affairs Avigdor Lieberman, who heads Yisrael Beitenu party with nine seats in parliament. The former minister, who used to be a major ally of Netanyahu, is now one of his key opponents. He had previously said that any unity government should include both Likud and Blue and White parties. But later, he announced that he was unconvinced by Netanyahu’s unity offer. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "Russia says the United States appears to be encouraging Kurdish militants in Syria to stay close to Turkey’s border in defiance of a new Moscow-Ankara deal and keep fighting with the Turkish military, warning the Kurds to either leave those areas or be mauled by the Turks. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement on Wednesday that Washington had actually betrayed the Kurds by abruptly pulling its forces out of Syria’s northern regions and leaving them vulnerable to a Turkish military offensive. He was speaking a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, unveiled a 10-point memorandum of understanding following lengthy talks in Sochi on the situation in northern Syria. The deal, which put Turkey’s offensive on hold, requires the withdrawal of Kurdish militants of the so-called People’s Protection Units (YPG) 30 kilometers away from the Turkish border. Peskov further warned that if the militants fail to leave the region, they would be dealt with by the Turkish army. “The United States has been the Kurds’ closest ally in recent years. (But) in the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them,” he said. “Now they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border (with Turkey) and almost force them to fight the Turks.” Peskov further noted that if the Kurds choose to remain in northern Syria, “Syrian border guards and Russian military police officers will have to pull back. In fact, the remaining Kurdish units will be crushed by the Turkish military machine.” Turkey: No need for renewed offensive at this stage Earlier, the Turkish Defense Ministry said, “At this stage, there is no further need to conduct a new operation outside the present operation area” after the deal was reached with Moscow. PressTV-Russia, Turkey strike deal on north Syria safe zone Russia and Turkey have agreed to remove Kurdish militants from border areas in northern Syria and launch joint patrols there. Under the deal, Russian military police and Syrian border guards will enter the northern border regions at 12:00 noon on Wednesday to facilitate the removal of YPG militants and their weapons to a depth of 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Syria’s frontier with Turkey. Once the process is complete, within 150 hours, Turkish and Russian soldiers will begin joint patrols of the entire border area to a depth of 10 kilometers (six miles) with the exception of the border city of Qamishli in Hasakah Province. Russian and Turkish officials did not immediately say what the arrangement would be around Qamishli. Erdogan and Putin also stressed the importance of the Adana Agreement between Ankara and Damascus, vowing cooperation on finding a lasting political solution to the Syrian conflict within the Astana mechanism. The Adana Interstate Agreement on Combating Terrorism — which was signed between Turkey and Syria on October 20, 1998 — clearly stated that the Damascus government would not allow any activities of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militant group — on Syrian soil, and would block any terror activities that could threaten Turkey’s sovereignty. As per the pact, Turkish troops are allowed to temporarily push up to a maximum of 10 km (6 miles) into Syria to conduct counter-terrorism operations. Turkey launched the offensive on October 9 with the aim of purging the region near its border of Kurdish militants, whom it views as terrorists linked to local autonomy-seeking PKK militants. The incursion came after the US abruptly pulled its forces out of the region, clearing the path for Ankara to go ahead with the offensive against Washington’s longtime Kurdish allies. Nine days into the operation, Turkey agreed on October 17 to a US-brokered truce, under which it paused the offensive for five days while the US helped facilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish militants from a planned 120-kilometer (75-mile) safe zone between the Syrian border towns of Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The Turkey-Russia deal was announced shortly before the expiry of that deadline. Elsewhere in its statement, the Turkish Defense Ministry said that Ankara had “shown due sensitivity in fulfilling all the obligations” under the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. “Turkey will never let a terror corridor be established to the south of her borders and our resolute fight against terrorism will continue. So by creating a peace corridor in the area, we will ensure the safe and voluntary return of displaced Syrian brothers and sisters to their homes and lands,” it added. Iran: Turkey-Russia deal positive step On Wednesday, Iran welcomed the Turkey-Russia deal on Syria, describing it as a “positive step” towards the establishment of peace and stability in the region. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi expressed hope that the agreement would help both soothe Turkey’s security concerns and preserve Syria’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Iran, he said, has always supported talks and peaceful methods to settle rifts, describing the 1998 Adana Agreement as an “appropriate basis” for easing the concerns of both neighbors. Mousavi said Tehran would spare no efforts to pave the way for dialog and understanding between Ankara and Damascus. “The solution to regional problems lies inside the [very] region and the pullout of American forces will restore peace and security to the region,” the official said.

    "articleText": "…by Gordon Duff, Senior Editor, with Nahed al Husaini in Damascus Netanyahu stopped first in Jordan and then switched to a private Saudi owned plane. From there he landed in Riyadh, where he met Jared Kushner. Netanyahu arranged for American paramilitary forces, we are told working for GOP-supporter Erik Prince, whose Chinese based Frontier Services is to supply support staff for residual ISIS commands in Syria and Iraq and to help prepare for a new iteration of ISIS to hit Iraq. With Iran withdrawing from Iraq (ongoing and not publicly known), a new version of ISIS is being built up among Sunni/Baathist groups in Baghdad. The goal is a new Iraqi civil war and another US invasion within the structure of the mutual security agreement. This is some of why the government of Iraq has gone to the UN to demand that the new unauthorized American force leave Iraq. Iraq is also aware of a nearly 500 mercenary operation building an ISIS base in and near the Syrian oil fields Trump ordered seized. ISIS leaders, formerly imprisoned in Syria, were “sprung” by private military special operations groups and are forming a new base of operations that will have strong ties to the powerful Israeli military and intelligence clandestine group inside the Kurdish region of Iraq. Financing it all will be not just stolen Syrian oil, but the added benefit of Trump “pulling a fast one” on Putin by starving the new larger Syria of oil. The real goal will be an Iraqi civil war, where the winners will declare war on Iran, aided by the US, Britain and France. Loading...
