    "description": "ATHENS (Sputnik) - Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Ieronymos II has officially acknowledged the autocephaly of the so-called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and sent a letter of congratulations to its self-styled primate Epiphanius, a Greek ecclesiastical source said.",
    "articleText": "\"Ieronymos sent a so-called letter of peace to Epiphanius. It is an official acknowledgement of a new Ukrainian church. On October 21, he sent a letter to Epiphanius, in which he wrote that he acknowledged him officially\", the source said. Not everyone agrees with that, according to him. \"A few metropolitan bishops demand to convene an extraordinary synod and intend to lodge a complaint with the Council of State (the highest legal authority in Greece) as it is illegal\", a source added. The statement comes after the Synod of the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece became the first Orthodox church to recognise on 12 October Constantinople's decision to give the UOC the Tomos of autocephaly. Additionally, the Synod granted Archbishop Ieronymos II the right to make decisions regarding the issue of autocephaly, clearing the way for the Greek church to take the next step and officially recognize the Ukrainian church. On 6 January, Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople handed over the Tomos of autocephaly to the newly established Ukrainian church. The Russian Orthodox Church, along with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, refused to recognize either occurrence. The Moscow Patriarchate has described the situation as the \"legalization of schism,\" stressing that it would have catastrophic consequences and affect millions of Christians in Ukraine and other countries.",

    "description": "Ye and his new album, which was released on 25 October, continue to generate buzz, drawing more and more attention ‚Äì from fast food restaurant chains to gamers. This time, they won the attention of President Trump‚Äôs son.",
    "articleText": "Donald Trump Jr has called Kanye West a pioneer and praised his new album in a post on Twitter. West, who actively supports President Trump, recently released his long-awaited album ‚ÄúJesus is King‚Äù - and it has caused quite a stir. The rapper has been accused of ripping off the soundtrack to the popular video game Zelda, resorting to a simplistic approach towards writing lyrics, which was taunted by Burger King, and raised eyebrows when he confessed that he had asked people involved in the creation of the album not to have premarital sex in order to stay focused on their work, as well as opening up about his porn addiction. For his part, Donald Trump Jr heaped praise on the rapper, saying ‚ÄúJesus is King is the epitome of fearless creativity and 'dangerous, unapproved' ideas‚Äù. Kanye West is cracking the culture code.@kanyewest‚Äôs new album #JesusIsKing is the epitome of fearless creativity and ‚Äúdangerous, unapproved‚Äù ideas.

Kanye is a pioneer pic.twitter.com/EmPgLqgGZJ ‚Äî Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 29, 2019 The businessman was inundated with comments and his post was retweeted more than 21,000 times. Some users suggested that Trump Jr‚Äôs endorsement of West and the artist‚Äôs decision to quit rap music and pursue a career in gospel is a sign that the star is not in his prime anymore. This tells you all you need to know. Kanye is not it anymore. ‚Äî Joshua (@_Brojan_) October 29, 2019 That album is a mediocre. One of his worst in my humble opinion. Trump Jr endorsing it is not a good look for Kanye. ‚Äî Eddie Rockerz (@eddierockerz) October 29, 2019 Other users defended the artist and urged netizens not to politicise everything. Liberals make everything about politics. Don‚Äôt get mad when conservatives do it. ‚Äî Cosmos (@CosmosKing23) October 29, 2019 It‚Äôs just music folks should relax no need to politicize everything ‚Äî Master Serge (@inyanya31) October 29, 2019 Other users unconditionally agreed with Trump Jr, praising the artist‚Äôs talent and his desire to embrace new genres.

    "description": "The defamation suit lodged by a pro-Trump news outlet against a renowned US journalist obliges her to pay a hefty sum if proved guilty and her legal team has apparently been thinking hard to come up with ways of inconspicuously backtracking on her ‚Äúutterly false‚Äù claims.",
    "articleText": "MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, currently involved in a legal battle over defamation charges, has requested that a San Diego court revoke a $10 million suit filed by One America News. Her attorney claims that it was not a distortion of facts, but a ‚Äúhyperbolic turn of phrase‚Äù when she dubbed the small conservative media outlet ‚Äúpaid Russian propaganda‚Äù, bringing up a former contributor to Russia's Sputnik, who is employed by OAN. Maddow's attorney, Theodore J. ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Boutrous Jr., noted that the host was clearly offering up her ‚Äúown unique expression‚Äù of her views to capture what she saw as the ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù nature of a number of facts. ‚ÄúHer comment, therefore, is a quintessential statement ‚Äòof rhetorical hyperbole, incapable of being proved true or false‚Äô‚Äù, he said. A hearing on the case is set for 16 December. Sputnik‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan weighed in on the unfolding dispute, expressing hope on her Telegram account that ‚Äúthe little but proud television channel will manage it all‚Äù. In last month‚Äôs defamation suit, the plaintiff contended that the claims Maddow made on her authorial show in July were \"utterly and completely false‚Äù. The lawsuit reflects a recent tit-for-tat exchange between MSNBC, along with its umbrella company Comcast, and OAN, which, it states, underlies the conflict. The suit suggests that Maddow, by making the ‚ÄúRussian propaganda claims‚Äù, was retaliating against OAN President Charles Herring‚Äôs criticism of Comcast after he blasted the giant for its ‚Äúanti-competitive censorship‚Äù. OAN's attorneys assumed that Comcast had refused to include the pro-Trump channel into its cable network because its politics contradict MSNBC's ‚Äúliberal\" views. The suit argued that MSNBC had thus prevented its audience from \"hearing a different viewpoint‚Äù. Speaking on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" on 22 July, days after Herring‚Äôs critical remarks, the host brought up a Daily Beast article that mentioned OAN-employed Kristian Rouz, who formerly contributed to the Russian media outlet Sputnik. She then went on to claim that \"in this case, the most obsequiously pro-Trump right-wing news outlet in America really literally is paid Russian propaganda‚Äù. Up in Arms Against Big Tech's 'Anti-Conservative Bias' Bias in favour of US mainstream liberal media and attacks on right-wing outlets have long been a talking point for the current presidential administration. The White House has consistently accused tech platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube of hampering pro-conservative opinion makers like InfoWars founder Alex Jones or squelching posts by pro-Trump social media personalities like Diamond and Silk. The companies have denied the allegations of bias, admitting, though, that they have been blocking or kicking out users who violate the rules. Trump railed against censorship in July during a White House gathering, calling for his administration to explore all ‚Äúregulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans‚Äù, insistently calling for ignoring what he brands \"fake news\" media outlets, like CNN, MSNBC, etc.",

The statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, adopted on 22 October a memorandum to resolve the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border in light of Ankara's offensive targeting the Kurdish forces. Under the document, Russian military police and Syrian border guards are facilitating the withdrawal of Kurdish militia from an 18-mile zone on the border within a 150-hour time frame that began on 23 October. Earlier in the month, US President Donald Trump abruptly announced the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria thereby abandoning the Kurdish allies whom they backed in fighting the Daesh* terror group.

The US had withheld the funds last year after Sirisena sacked his former ally, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and called snap elections, a move which was later overruled by the Supreme Court in Colombo. Sri Lanka is dependent on foreign aid and loans and economic growth slowed to 1.8 percent last year amid the political turmoil.

Romania Corruption is going to be a key issue in the Romanian presidential elections, which take place on 10 November. In the spring of 2017 Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu began amending legislation to significantly weaken regulations on abuses of power, essentially decriminalising corruption. There were massive protests - the biggest since the fall of President Ceaucescu in 1989 - and in June 2017 Grindeanu was ousted after losing a vote of confidence. President Klaus Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 and is seeking re-election, publicly opposed the legislation and asked the government to withdraw it.

    "description": "Controversial ‚Äúinformation integrity‚Äù firm New Knowledge, which produced a report commissioned and endorsed by the US Senate on the activities of the Internet Research Agency before, during and after the 2016 Presidential election, has rebranded as Yonder.",
    "articleText": "In a somewhat perplexing statement on its website, the company‚Äôs cofounder Jonathon Morgan ‚Äì a US national security establishment veteran ‚Äì outlines the rationale behind the change. Noting ‚Äúpeople are bonded by things they oppose or dislike, but also by things they love‚Äù, he states while previously the company ‚Äúfocused solely on negative attention‚Äù, it‚Äôs since expanded its purview to ‚Äúcreate the needed familiarity with both adversaries and allies‚Äù. ‚ÄúArticulating what we stand for requires we know which of these groups to engage with and how. The internet has given us the luxury of making values-based decisions. Consequently, we‚Äôre all under new pressure to be clear about what we stand for... Ensuring values connect authentically with customers, and learning which factions of online culture are responding most strongly to those values, either in a positive or negative way, has become critical... We believe an authentic, contextualized online culture leads to a responsible and receptive global community and our mission is to give the online world the same amount of cultural context as the offline world,‚Äù Morgan rambles. Ironically they did that two days after I trolled them in a tweet with Elizabeth Warren, I then went to look for them and they had changed their name. After I tweeted about yonderai they blocked meüòè https://t.co/rQiK7m3vit ‚Äî Dave Ravicher (@Whtapl) October 28, 2019 As a result, the name New Knowledge no longer fits the company‚Äôs ‚Äúexpanded mission or culture‚Äù, so a name reflecting the ‚Äújoyful, optimistic, approachable, and most of all, authentic‚Äù culture of the firm ‚Äì which is also ‚Äúfun to say, hear and read‚Äù ‚Äì was chosen instead. ‚ÄúYonder alludes to all of the new opportunities we can guide our clients toward, speaks to adventurous businesses ready to embrace new customers, new narratives, and a changing landscape, and also represents the future, but not the unattainable, full of sprawling horizons and fresh discoveries,‚Äù Morgan concludes. No Knowledge Readers could very much be forgiven for failing to catch Morgan‚Äôs meaning, but for anyone in the dark, tech website Austin Inno offered some clarity - the company has expanded its client base beyond government to ‚Äúhousehold consumer brands‚Äù, helping them ‚Äúspot authentic consumer factions that often drive conservations about brands and industries‚Äù, in the process assisting them in understanding their customers better to improve their marketing strategies. The name Yonder was said to have been chosen following a survey of the firm‚Äôs 60-strong staff, ‚Äúto get a sense of what the company‚Äôs mission means to them‚Äù, with feedback ‚Äú[amounting] to an optimistic vision for the future of the internet ‚Äî looking over the horizon and helping usher in an era where fake news, bots and other web wreckage isn‚Äôt so easily blended with real human insights and interactions‚Äù. Such sentiments are highly ironic given the company has been responsible for much ‚Äúweb wreckage‚Äù over the course of its four-year existence, activities that sparked significant outcry and had a massively deleterious impact on its credibility ‚Äì which may be the real motivation behind the updated moniker. So you didn't watch the Jimmy Dore or wasn't it in it? \" cybersecurity firm New Knowledge\" owner was banned from Facebook for creating fake Russian bots in order to make it look that Roy Moore in the Alabama election was supported by the Russians. You read propaganda. ‚Äî ZineManiac (@zinemaniac) October 22, 2019 By the firm‚Äôs own admission, it \"orchestrated an elaborate 'false flag' operation‚Äù to damage former state supreme court judge Roy Moore‚Äôs 2017 Alabama Senate campaign ‚Äì under its auspices, New Knowledge planted the idea Moore's campaign was being amplified online ‚Äúby a Russian botnet, and sought to perpetuate sexual assault allegations against Moore to \"enrage and energize Democrats\" and \"depress turnout\" among Republicans. It also created a Facebook page appealing to conservative Alabamians, encouraging them to endorse obscure candidate Mac Watson instead of Moore, and going to the extent of contacting Watson directly via the bogus page, stating they would endorse him and asking whether he trusted anyone \"to set up a super PAC that could receive funding\". They also covertly offered advice on \"how to sharpen [Watson‚Äôs] appeal to disenchanted Republican voters\", and arranged interviews for him with The Montgomery Advertiser and Washington Post. Simultaneously, Watson's Twitter following leaped from 100 to over 10,000. Many of those new followers were undoubtedly bots and almost certainly created by New Knowledge ‚Äì but simultaneously, the firm flooded the US media with allegations that thousands of Moore's Twitter followers were Russian bots. Local paper Montgomery Observer was first to regurgitate the claims, publishing an article in October 2017 - Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin - which was duly picked up by many other outlets, including Mother Jones. The organisation's report - Russian Propagandists Are Pushing for Roy Moore to Win - offered no evidence to support its headline beyond the findings of the Hamilton 68 dashboard. Launched by NATO and USAID-connected 'think tank' Alliance for Securing Democracy, the dashboard allegedly tracks in real-time 600 Twitter social media accounts \"linked to Russian influence\" ‚Äì amazingly, it was developed by none other than Jonathon Morgan, although when asked what techniques Hamilton 68 employs to identify online \"Kremlin influence\" operations, his response was somewhat lacking. \"We developed techniques for determining who matters in a conversation. Using some of those techniques, we've identified a subset of accounts we're very confident are core to furthering the Russian narrative in response to mainstream events,\" he unconvincingly equivocated. When the iniquitous ruse was publicly exposed in December 2018, New Knowledge claimed it had merely been an ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô to better understand online disinformation - few were convinced by the explanation though, with Alabama Senator Doug Jones being so ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù as to call for a fully-fledged federal investigation into the firm‚Äôs conduct. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs obvious now is we‚Äôve focused so much on Russia that we haven‚Äôt focused on the fact people in this country could take the same playbook and do the same damn thing. I‚Äôd like to see the [Federal Election Commission] and Justice Department look at this and see if any laws are being violated or were violated, and if there were, go after them. I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs going to happen again to me, my opponent, my colleagues up here, the people in the House, the president, the people who are going to run against the president. This shouldn‚Äôt happen to anyone in this country. We‚Äôve got to take steps to protect our electoral system,‚Äù he fulminated to Politico. New Knowledge changed its name to @yonderai a few days ago, they‚Äôre still under FEC investigation which is pending a 4th commissioner to be appointed by Trump. https://t.co/rQiK7m3vit ‚Äî Dave Ravicher (@Whtapl) October 25, 2019 In any event, if the effort was conducted for academic purposes, it appears no concrete learnings arose from it. The same month New Knowledge‚Äôs shady dealings were revealed, cofounder Ryan Fox ‚Äì like Morgan a US national security veteran ‚Äì made headlines after claiming he‚Äôd identified a vast number of prominent Kremlin-controlled social media accounts pumping out pro-Gilets Jaunes content. However, the few mainstream media outlets that asked for supporting evidence were left wanting ‚Äì Fox told Wall Street Journal he merely \"believed\" Russia was interfering in the protests, and Wired \"there‚Äôs no way to know for sure who is behind a particular influence network on a social media platform\". Just Beat It Nonetheless, New Knowledge has performed a valuable service to the cause of truth ‚Äì for its Senate-backed report, The Tactics and Tropes of the Internet Research Agency, unintentionally offered conclusive proof Russian social media activity played no role whatsoever in the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election. Most significantly, it noted evaluating IRA content ‚Äúpurely based on whether it definitively swung the election‚Äù was ‚Äútoo narrow‚Äù a research focus as ‚Äúexplicitly political content was a small percentage‚Äù of the IRA‚Äôs online output, amounting to a mere 11 percent of the total content attributed to the Agency, and 33 percent of user engagement with that content. Some points to stress: 1) it's tough to suggest that Russian clickbait helped decide the 2016 election when even the Senate authors acknowledge that just \"11% of the total content\" from Russian trolls \"was related to the election\", & their posts \"minimally about the candidates.\" pic.twitter.com/MIzCi0a6TC ‚Äî Aaron Mat√© (@aaronjmate) December 28, 2018 The IRA‚Äôs posts were moreover found to be ‚Äúminimally about the candidates‚Äù with ‚Äúroughly 6 percent of tweets, 18 percent of Instagram posts, and 7 percent of Facebook posts‚Äù mentioning Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton by name. Furthermore though, the report also starkly highlighted just how paranoid, fantastical and desperate advocates of the Russian interference narrative can be, often in extremely comical ways. For instance, in a section titled ‚ÄòAsset Development‚Äô, the authors stated the IRA engaged in ‚Äúhuman asset recruitment‚Äù tactics, which were ‚Äúexpansive, and clearly a priority‚Äù. ‚ÄúRecruiting an asset by exploiting a personal vulnerability ‚Äì usually a secret that would inspire shame or cause personal or financial harm if exposed ‚Äì is a timeless espionage practice. So is the tactic of infiltrating protest movements. The IRA attempted both, even going so far as to create help hotlines for people struggling with sexual behavior, creating an opportunity to blackmail or manipulate these individuals in the future,‚Äù the report alleged. What else is to be expected from the company which claimed in a report (commissioned and endorsed by the US Senate) the Facebook posts below were attempts by the Internet Research Agency to infiltrate protest movements and recruit 'assets'? pic.twitter.com/y1aEEakuFv ‚Äî Kit Klarenberg (@KitKlarenberg) October 28, 2019 Examples offered of this alleged strategy in action were unconvincing and humorous in equally extreme measure. ‚ÄúRequests for contact with preachers from black churches‚Äù, ‚Äúoffers of free counseling to people with sexual addiction‚Äù, ‚Äúrequests for photographers to document protests‚Äù, ‚Äújob offers for designers to help design fliers‚Äù and ‚Äúrequests for female followers to send photos for a calendar‚Äù were all said to be attempts to enlist potential agents ‚Äì but even more amusing were IRA-funded Facebook ads illustrating the phenomenon. One depicted Jesus consoling a despondent youth, accompanied by some stirring text - ‚ÄúStruggling with the addiction [sic] to masturbation? Reach out to me and we will beat it together. You can‚Äôt hold hands with God when you are masturbating. Use our hotline if you need help.‚Äù The suggestion the Kremlin sought to ensnare serial onanists as spies is far from the only claim in the report to stretch credibility to absolute breaking point - although ever since, Western journalists and politicians have invoked the document as evidence almost everything digital, from popular gaming app Pokemon Go to LGBT-positive sex toys, has been nefariously weaponised by the Kremlin, African-Americans were deterred from voting as a result of Russian influence, and US Green party politician Jill Stein is an agent of Moscow, among a great many other self-evidently ludicrous contentions.

    "articleText": "\"No, we have no confirmation\", Peskov said in response to a corresponding question. However, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a day earlier the Kremlin believes it will be possible to talk about Trump's serious contribution to the fight against terrorism if the death of al-Baghdadi is confirmed. The statement comes after Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said during a press briefing on 28 October that the United States is not prepared to release video or photos of the US special forces raid of al-Baghdadi's compound in Syria. On 27 October, US President Donald Trump announced that US forces hunted down al-Baghdadi in Syria's Idlib province. Trump said al-Baghdadi blew up himself and three accompanying children by detonating a suicide vest when he was trapped at the end of a tunnel. The Russian Defence Ministry said that it had possessed no reliable data regarding the US operation and had reasons to question its credibility.",

    "description": "US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that Daesh* leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world‚Äôs most wanted terrorist was killed as the result of a US Special Operations Forces night raid on his hideout in northwestern Syria.",
    "articleText": "According to Trump, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was the number one target of the US military for three years. The American president gave details of the terrorist's death saying that \"he died like a coward and a dog, running away and crying\". \"The Americans announced the killing of al-Baghdadi right now to maximise the advantage of this message in their interests\", Iraqi political analyst and strategic expert Ahmed al-Sharifi stated. \"Trump is investing in his election campaign. He especially needs it now, when American troops are modestly and quietly leaving Syria and Iraq. I think that the Islamic State will decline and gradually disappear from the face of the earth\", al-Sharifi said. The Russian Ministry of Defence doubted the reality of the US operation to annihilate Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Russian Ministry of Defence spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov said. \"The Ministry of Defence does not have reliable information on the conduct of the US military in the Turkish-controlled part of the Idlib de-escalation zone, or on the operation aimed at yet another \"elimination\" of the former ISIS* leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\", MoD spokesperson said. Daesh Will Hide the Fact of the Leader's Death Irina Fedorova, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Oriental Studies, at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that there could be no reliable information on the death of any IS* leader: \"If such an event had occurred or will occur, then it will be classified by the IS* leadership because al-Baghdadi's figure is a symbol that promotes the unification of IS* fighters from different groups. If his killing happens, his companions will do everything possible so that no evidence of this will come to light\", she said. \"More important is why the Americans are now talking about his elimination. They need victory, triumph, evidence that they are the best in the annihilation of terrorists\", the expert considered. Irina Fedorova recalled one of the facts of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's biography that he was being held in an Iraqi prison controlled by the Americans: \"How was he released, under what circumstances, why? There are a lot of questions and even more speculation\", the expert said. Daesh Will Be Revived in Afghanistan Under a New Leader Franz Klintsevich, a member of the Russian parliament's upper house's Defence Committee, said he has no confidence that these reports of al-Baghdadi's death are correct, noting that the situation is similar to Barrack Obama's on the eve of the election: \"Here you need to remember that the IS* is a product of Western intelligence agencies and the United States, above all. Now, I think, there is a regrouping of forces. And if al-Baghdadi is really killed, then I am almost sure soon we will hear about the new leader of the IS. Most likely, it will be in Afghanistan\", Klintsevich said. A Fake to Sink Trump Russian military expert (ret) Colonel Alexander Zhilin, head of the Moscow-based Centre for the Study of Public Applied Problems of the National Security, pointed out that the Americans did not provide any evidence: \"I think that if he [al-Baghdadi] has really been eliminated, this would be confirmed by Israel, which controls everything in the area to the molecule\". \"This could've been done both by Trump to raise his ratings and by his opponents. Now Trump is making a lot of statements, and so if a month later al-Baghdadi appears on TV - Trump's rating goes down the drain\", retired Colonel Alexander Zhilin concluded. *Daesh (ISIL/ISIS/IS/Islamic State) is a terrorist organisation banned in Russia The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "articleText": "US media outlet The National Interest, which focuses on the global defence industry, has come up with a short list of five nations that are more likely to buy Russia‚Äôs fifth-generation fighter jet, the Su-57, as the aircraft is about to be delivered to the Russian Air Force. One of these countries could be Turkey, which has essentially been kicked out of the F-35 programme by the US over its purchase of S-400 air defence systems from Moscow.

However, Moscow has never confirmed selling the air defence systems to the North African state. The magazine further pointed out that Algeria has also shown interest in the Su-35 ‚Äì a predecessor of the Su-57 ‚Äì which has only a small difference in terms of its price per plane.

The \"air specialisation\" of the Su-57 could also hinder its entry onto the Chinese market, with Beijing already developing its own fifth generation stealth jet, the J-20, which focuses on penetrating enemy defences and delivering ground strikes, according to the media outlet. China may still be interested in acquiring Su-57s for training purposes, as well as to study it for technologies that could be applied in the domestically produced fighter jet, the magazine pointed out. As a result of China‚Äôs interest in the Su-57, India may also be incentivised to acquire the cutting-edge Russian warplane, the media outlet added. According to The National Interest, the Indian Air Force has already \"cautiously\" signalled interest in the jet.

    "description": "While the protests breaking out in Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia have different causes all of them are to some extent caused by Washington's longstanding strategy aimed at holding the reins of its \"backyard\", explains Brazilian professor Gustavo Guerreiro.",
    "articleText": "Latin America has recently been disturbed by three waves of anti-government protests: first, unrest broke out in Ecuador on 3 October and then disturbances erupted in Chile and Bolivia on 14 and 21 October, respectively. The Ecuadorian protests raged on until mid-October and were triggered by the government's decision to abolish the country‚Äôs 40-year-old fuel subsidy under austerity measures agreed upon by Ecuadorian President Len√≠n Moreno and the IMF. The trigger point for the upheaval in Chile was an increase in the fare for the Santiago subway that was seemingly the last straw amid the country's longstanding economic difficulties. As for Bolivia, the turmoil kicked off as a response to claims of electoral fraud in the 20 October 2019 general vote won by incumbent Bolivian President Evo Morales. While President of Ecuador Len√≠n Moreno has somehow found a way to calm the protests, the governments of Chile and Bolivia are still struggling to find a compromise with demonstrators. Gustavo Guerreiro, editor of the World Tensions Magazine of the Cear√° State University (UECE), Brazil, and a member of the Brazilian Centre for Solidarity with Peoples and Fight for Peace (CEBRAPAZ) has explained what is behind the turmoil engulfing the three South American states and how these events differ from one another. Sputnik: Who is behind the recent clashes in Chile and Bolivia, what are the major causes and driving forces? Gustavo Guerreiro: In the cases of Chile and Bolivia, these are different situations that reveal the crisis of a same nature. Chile was hit by a neo-liberal dismantling that has its roots in the 1970s in the military dictatorship. It has an economic policy that has deepened the process of dismantling the state and the population's living conditions, who then now take to the streets for dignity. A country that has a retirement system that is privatised and bankrupt. Where 50% of pensions are below the minimum wage and 44% are below the poverty line. In Bolivia, Evo [Morales] won the elections with 200 international observers. The country has a totally opposite policy of Chile with the strong role of the state in the figure of Evo. It recorded the largest economic growth in South America, which, according to the IMF, signaled an advance of 4% of the country's GDP. It has a policy of nationalisation of hydrocarbons and natural resources. The nature of the conflict in Chile is due to the spasm of society against neo-liberal policies and in Bolivia it is a conservative reaction of the amalgamated elites with US imperialism. They have the same root, which is the advance of the imperialist policy in the region. ¬© REUTERS / UESLEI MARCELINO Bolivia's President and presidential candidate Evo Morales of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party is greeted by supporters as he arrives to vote during the presidential election at a polling station in a school in Villa 14 de Septiembre, in the Chapare region, Bolivia, October 20, 2019. Sputnik: Are the recent clashes in Chile and Bolivia somehow connected with the turmoil in Ecuador? Could these three separate protest movements be described in terms of a left-right political struggle in Latin America? Gustavo Guerreiro: The conflicts in Chile and Bolivia are related to the turbulence in Ecuador since they are movements of \"action-reaction\" to this imperialist policy imposed by the US, especially in Latin America. The protests are of a different nature especially in the case of Chile and Ecuador. They have a popular face against the loss of social rights, dismantling of social policies, dismantling the state, it comes from a population that is not always organised. In the case of Bolivia, it is an action by reactionary sectors of the society, which see in the advancement of Evo Morales government's nationalist policies a loss of privileges and certain elites that are in line with the project of neo-liberal domination imposed by the US government. Sputnik: Who is interested in ousting Morales and how could it affect the situation in Venezuela? Gustavo Guerreiro: In the case of the election in Bolivia it is interesting to note that the modus operandi adopted in the election was similar what happened in Brazil in 2014. Even before starting the election process the candidate who lost (A√©cio Neves) announced that he did not believe in the electronic electoral system. In Bolivia the same thing happened. As the conservative camp in Bolivia cannot win in the democratic camp, they try to defraud the electoral camp. Those who are interested in kicking Evo [Morales] out are the elites aligned with this Washington DC imperialist power project. The situation can be impacted because the reality of these countries cannot be considered as immune to the regional strategic game. Any movement in Argentina, in Ecuador, Peru and especially in Brazil has serious consequences in Venezuela. So the realities are all interconnected. It is a complex geopolitical reality.

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Financial messaging systems help to securely communicate, reconcile, and manage the data in transactions within and between banks, both locally and internationally.",
    "articleText": "Three members of the BRICS (association of emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) trade bloc, Russia, India, and China, have decided to connect their financial messaging systems to bypass SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Finance Telecommunication), an international money transfer network. Reports say Russia‚Äôs financial messaging system SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) will be linked with the Chinese Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). While India does not have a domestic financial messaging system yet, it plans to combine the Central Bank of Russia‚Äôs platform with a domestic service that is in development. Russia has been developing SPFS in sync with various new mechanisms, such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), New Development Bank (NDB), and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), as a supplement to the existing governance mechanisms. ‚ÄúThe fact remains that the establishment of these mechanisms is the outcome of the Bretton Woods System that has been on shaky grounds after the 2008-09 financial crisis as well as the Euro crisis. The protectionist tendencies along with weaponising economic sanctions by some on the others will certainly force countries to shift to other mechanisms‚Äù, Professor B.R. Deepak, trained in Chinese history and India-China relations at Peking University and Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, explains. Reflecting on the potential benefits that India may enjoy by joining the Russian financial messaging system, Deepak says: ‚ÄúAs far as India is concerned, it joining the new system may work well as far as trading in local currencies is concerned. However, to replace the transactions in dollars outside the bloc would be difficult as most of its trade is outside the BRICS bloc‚Äù. The new system may hide India's transactions from the US, but the deals may not go unnoticed, therefore, the fear of sanctions will still loom, he says. Indian banks have also been the victim of frauds due to the misuse of SWIFT. The Punjab National Bank (PNB) suffered a fraud of $1.77 billion, as SWIFT was allegedly manipulated by PNB employees to let diamond merchant Nirav Modi channel money illegally. About the new system being secure from such transactions, Deepak says that the scope of fraud remains, unless complete transparency and honesty is in place.",

He added that the region is now under the control of Syrian border guards and Russian military police. Shoigu also revealed that Russian forces, along with their counterparts from Armenia, are conducting mine-sweeping activities in the region, having already cleared 100 square kilometres not only of mines, but also of various undetonated ordnances that could pose a threat to civilians. ¬© Sputnik / Mikhail Alayeddin Russian Military Police in Syria Ankara halted its military operation, called \"Peace Spring\", giving the Kurds a limited timeframe to withdraw from their positions within the so-called safe-zone in northern Syria, east of the Euphrates. Ankara believes that the Kurdish YPG forces are linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey. Ankara said that the withdrawal of the Kurdish militia from northern Syria near the border with Turkey was a key precondition for halting its military operation. Moscow and Ankara recently agreed during talks in Sochi that Russian military police and Syrian border guards would facilitate the YPG's withdrawal. Under the Sochi memorandum, Russian military police and Turkish forces would also jointly patrol a 10-kilometre wide zone to the east and west of Ankara‚Äôs recent military operation in Syria.",

    "description": "Ankara‚Äôs membership in the alliance has been questioned by some German politicians after it launched an operation in the north of the war-torn country, insisting that it is targeting Daesh jihadists and Kurdish militias, which Turkey considers a part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), banned by the country.",
    "articleText": "The majority of German respondents, polled by agency YouGov, backed the expulsion of Turkey from NATO over Ankara‚Äôs operation in northern Syria, the German news agency DPA reports. In the survey, conducted on behalf of the outlet, 58 percent supported the idea while only 18 percent spoke against it. A broader majority of respondents also favoured the German government taking a tougher stance against Turkey with 61 percent backing economic sanctions and 69 percent supporting a complete arms export ban. Germany has criticised Turkey for launching an incursion into northern Syria to push Kurdish militias from its border. Berlin has already limited arms sales to Turkey. However, arms sales are not totally banned, as Deutsche Welle points out although German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that Berlin would not deliver any arms to Turkey in the wake of Ankara's operation in northeast Syria. The idea to expel Turkey from NATO, as well, has been already expressed by some German politicians, including members of the left-wing party Die Linke. The acting chairman of the centre-left SPD parliamentary group Rolf Muetzenich even called into question Ankara's membership in the bloc. NATO's founding charter doesn‚Äôt spell out a mechanism for member states to expel an ally, which makes the hypothetical expulsion complicated and lengthy, something that in effect should be ratified by all member states. Turkey kicked off its operation in northern Syria on 9 October with a stated goal of clearing the region of Kurdish militias and Daesh*. Ankara considers the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) to be terrorists. Before the Turkish operation, the YPG had been supported by the US in their fight against Daesh as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The offensive has been widely condemned by the international community with the Syrian government calling it an aggressive violation of the nation's sovereignty. Damascus even moved to work together with Kurdish forces to defend the country. *Daesh, also known as ISIS/IS/ISIL, is a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other counties.",

However, the demonstrators did not accept the proposed plan, blaming Lebanon‚Äôs confessional governmental structure for breeding tribalism and corruption. Around two million people out of Lebanon‚Äôs population of six million are believed have taken part in the anti-governmental actions.

    "description": "It seems that older UFO conspiracy theories are overlapping with newer ones - on the breakthrough undercover US Space Force fleet that is purportedly now in the making.",
    "articleText": "Bruce Gagnon, the co-founder and coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in Space, has addressed footage of snake-like UFOs along with other inscrutable aerial phenomena spotted over the US, claiming in comments to the Daily Star Online that it may be the new US Space Force testing its vehicles. \"I think it's possible, I spoke about the secret military budget, the black budget and the development of advanced technologies, and it is possible that some of these so-called crafts are these new technologies‚Äù, Gagnon shared. The head of the anti-Space Force organisation stressed that it might be just a speculation, although he believes ‚Äúit‚Äôs conceivable and it‚Äôs possible‚Äù. He went on to recount one occasion - a Space Militarisation Peace talk - in which he saw with his own eyes the photo of what is being developed by the agency. It was that of the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider, which, he noted, looked like \"something out of space‚Äù. The anti-space warfare campaigner previously accused the USAF of \"creating a new generation of space soldiers by indoctrinating kids\". The creation of the United States Space Force (USSF), the proposed space warfare service branch of the Armed Forces, intended to control military space operations, was announced by President Donald Trump last year. It would constitute the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, within the Air Force, and the eighth US uniformed service. Earlier, the Drive reported that US forces had confirmed cutting a ‚Äúcurious cooperative‚Äù deal with the company To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science (TTSA) set up by former Blink-182 front man Tom DeLonge, to carefully study the artefacts of alien origin purported to have been artificially created from some meta materials. The report came shortly after US Navy officials confirmed the recently released videos allegedly featuring military vehicles encountering bizarre UFO-like objects that did indeed have ‚Äúunidentified aerial phenomena\", the BlackVault website reported citing sources. In separate instances, \"triangular crafts\" were recorded by the International Space Station live feed as they \"hovered\" over Earth. Many viewers believed at the time that the mysterious vehicles belonged to the newly minted Space Force branch, while others continued to bring up UFO conspiracy theories.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Researchers at the International Institute of Technology in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad have developed the first-ever Indian Brain Atlas.",
    "articleText": "The Indian brain, on average, is smaller in size, width and volume, in comparison with people in the West and East. The study may also help in the diagnosis of brain ailments such as Alzheimer‚Äôs. The Indian Brain Atlas or, the \"IBA\" is much more similar to Chinese and Korean atlases than the distant Caucasian one, says Jayanthi Sivaswamy, the lead researcher and a professor at the Centre for Visual Information Technology, Hyderabad. The construction of the Atlas was done in collaboration with the Department of Imaging Sciences and Interventional Radiology, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) had created the first digital human brain atlas in 1993 ‚Äì widely used in neuroscience studies. However, these templates were made with Caucasian brains ‚Äì not ideal for analysing brains of other ethnicities. \"These MNI templates come typically loaded in MRI scanning machines, which can lead to an incorrect diagnosis\", Sivaswamy explained. Brain templates for Chinese and Korean brains have been constructed, but nothing corresponding to Indian-specific population. The IITH team, therefore, made the effort to create an Indian-specific brain atlas which involved 50 subjects across genders. The MRI scans of these subjects were then taken to three hospitals, across three different scanners to rule out the variations found in the scanning machines. Sivaswamy added they hope to build a larger brain atlas with a heterogeneous mix of subjects to take into account diversity. He also emphasised that the team‚Äôs focus is to understand the process of ageing.",

The 2015 Paris massacre, when three groups of terrorists staged assaults in the city and its northern suburbs, leaving 130 dead and hundreds wounded, is considered the worst in France‚Äôs history.",
    "articleText": "Police have detained a man, who allegedly shouted ‚ÄúAllah Akbar‚Äù during a screening of the ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù at a movie theatre in central Paris, making cinema-goers run out in terror, Le Parisien reports. According to the outlet, citing a source close to the investigation, the man is \"a little disturbed‚Äù. So the detention was lifted following a behavioral review and he was subsequently admitted to a police psychiatric infirmary. The incident took place on Sunday at the Grand Rex complex, which claims to be \"the biggest cinema in Europe\", during an evening showing of the US box office hit about the cartoonish villain, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. As one of the audience members revealed to the French outlet, a guy, accompanied by another man, repeatedly shouted that it was political in the middle of the film. At first, people laughed before some asked him to shut up. Then, he reportedly stood up, putting his hands on his chest, and shouted ‚ÄúAllah Akbar‚Äù ‚Äì a phrase often uttered by Islamist terrorists. According to the witness, people panicked and cried but the doors were blocked. Another witness added that the suspect was muttering something in Arabic, while someone wrongly suggested that he had a weapon. ‚ÄúThere was total panic, these are images that I will not forget, people climbed over their seats. Women fell onto the floor, and others who were stepping over them‚Äù, one of the shocked moviegoers told the outlet. The movie theatre has confirmed the incident, saying, however, that the emergency doors were open; that only a few dozen spectators panicked while others stayed to watch the film to the very end. The management also saluted visitors who tried to surround the individual while waiting for the police even though he eventually managed to escape. One witness snatched the man‚Äôs jacket with his phone and a pass with his name. The 34-year-old was detained by a police patrol behind the cinema. As the report points out, apart from dealing with the panic that ensued, some spectators were robbed as perpetrators allegedly took advantage of the situation to search through their bags. France and Paris, in particular, have witnessed several deadly attacks, committed by Daesh* supporters and radicalised Muslims. The terrorist assaults in the French capital on 13 November 2015 were considered the worst in France‚Äôs history. Three coordinated groups of terrorists staged a series of attacks in Paris and one of the city‚Äôs northern suburbs, Saint-Denis, which left 130 dead and over 350 wounded. A series of explosions occurred outside Stade de France, while in northeastern Paris, three gunmen burst into the Bataclan concert hall with approximately 1,500 people inside, opening fire and taking some of the audience members hostage. *Daesh, also known as ISIS/IS/ISIL, is a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other counties.",

    "description": "Police have arrested 31 people in connection with drug trafficking, but the judge later released most of the suspects.",
    "articleText": "Mexican police have discovered 40 skulls, a foetus in a jar and dozens of other human bones during a raid on the home of suspected drug traffickers in the capital Mexico City. According to a local resident, the criminals allegedly conducted satanic rituals, said to make them immune to police bullets and bring good fortune in their criminal activity. Photos published by local media outlets show the items placed near an altar with a cross and a wooden mask on it. The wall to the right of the altar was adorned with a pyramid, celestial bodies, and a goat with a hexagram between its horns. Law enforcement officers also found dozens of other human bones and are now trying to determine how many people have been killed in this home and the victims‚Äô identities. Police officers arrested 26 men and five women during the raid on five houses in the Tepito neighbourhood, who they believe are part of the Union Tepito cartel, but the judge later released most of the suspects. The main target of the raid was the alleged leader of the cartel nicknamed El Lunares, who police said escaped via a tunnel. Omar Garcia Harfuch, head of the police in Mexico City, told local media that the cartel had received protection from the authorities who might have warned them of the upcoming raid. In 2006, the Mexican government launched a military campaign known as the Mexican Drug War against cartels operating in the country. Authorities‚Äô primary aim was to stop drug related violence, however after 13 years the number of casualties hasn't decreased. More than 33,000 people were murdered in Mexico in 2018. Mexican authorities have recently suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands Sinaloa cartel, who turned the city of Culiac√°n into a war zone after law enforcement officials detained Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, head of the cartel and son of notorious drug lord El Chapo, who is awaiting trial in the United States. To the amazement of the public, security forces released Joaqu√≠n Guzman as they feared that by continuing a shootout they were endangering the lives of civilians. Renata Avila, a political analyst specialising in Latin America said Mexico can‚Äôt solve the drug issue on its own. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a regional and even global problem. The only way tackle this problem is with a series of measures that put social investment at the core of it ‚Äì education, investment in social security. Authorities should give people a dignified existence so that they don‚Äôt have to turn into drug dealers or traffickers of drugs‚Äù, said Renata Avila.",

    "title": "India Dismisses Rumour of Cyber Attack on Tamil Nadu Nuclear Facility as 'Impossible'",
    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Social media was filled with speculation of a cyber-attack being launched on the nuclear plant's systems, with some netizens mentioning a spy virus infection.",
    "articleText": "The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu on Tuesday denied being the victim of a cyber-attack after Twitter was abuzz with speculation of a spy virus having infected its systems. Located off the Bay of Bengal in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu state, the power plant is the single largest nuclear power station in India. The KKNPP is scheduled to have six VVER-1000 water energy reactors built through a joint venture between Russia‚Äôs Atomstroyexport and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL). Once all six nuclear plants are built, they will generate 6,000 megawatts of electricity. With rumours floating on social media, a Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project spokesperson had to issue a statement saying that the plant‚Äôs control system is stand alone and not connected to any cyber network or the Internet outside its periphery. \"Any cyber attack on the nuclear power plant control system is not possible\", the spokesperson added in the statement. Several people, including Indian politician Shashi Tharoor, took to social media earlier in the day to voice their concerns over the alleged mishap. This seems very serious. If a hostile power is able to conduct a cyber attack on our nuclear facilities, the implications for India's national security are unimaginable. The Government owes us an explanation. https://t.co/5NokFcQFWs ‚Äî Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) October 29, 2019 Does cyber security figure in the charter of the Standing Committee headed by you?

They operate on stand alone basis. This is just like allegations of EVM hacking. ‚Äî jaydeep desai (@jm_desai) October 29, 2019 R. Ramdoss, training superintendent and information officer at the power plant, said: \"Presently, KKNPP Unit-1 & 2 are operating at 1000 MWe and 600 MWe respectively without any operational or safety concerns\". The clarification came after speculative posts emerged that the power plant was the target of a variant of a virus known as DTrack RAT. According to the Russian anti-virus and cyber security company Kaspersky, DTrack is a variant of a malware known as AMDTrack that is able to download files to infected systems, record key strokes, and conduct other actions similar to remote controlling the infected systems. The cyber security firm said its list of functions define it as a \"spy tool\".",

    "articleText": "In a historic step, Oslo‚Äôs newly installed ‚Äúred-green‚Äù City Council led by the Socialist Left, Labour and the Greens, is contemplating a ban on the municipality's procurement of goods and services from Israeli settlements. This is part of their cooperation platform for 2019-2023, the three left-of-centre parties intend to ‚Äúinvestigate the extent of trade regulations that exist in order not to procure goods and services produced in an area occupied in violation of international law by companies operating under the permission of the occupying power‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Palestinian people have been living under illegal occupation for over 50 years. It is a shared global responsibility to contribute to lasting peace and the freedom of the Palestinians, which is why I am pleased that the City Council is now considering the possibility of actively using its purchasing power against the occupation‚Äù, Socialist Left group leader Sunniva Holm√•s Eidsvoll said, as quoted by the newspaper Nettavisen. ‚Äì Det palestinske folket har levd under ulovlig okkupasjon i over 50 √•r. Det er et felles globalt ansvar √• bidra til varig fred og palestinernes frihet, sier @SunnivaHEi. @FrittPalestina @PalKom https://t.co/MQP3izYX7W ‚Äî Oslo SV (@oslosv) 29 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2019 –≥. Oslo's move was lauded by the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), which works for businesses to remove investments from Israel. ‚ÄúWe welcome this legally and morally responsible step taken by the Oslo City Council. Local councils are showing they are undeterred by repression, and continue to pave the way, despite inaction by national governments. A ban on goods and services from Israel‚Äôs illegal settlements is the very least that government institutions should enact to cut their complicity with Israel‚Äôs regime of apartheid, settler colonialism, and occupation‚Äù, Alys Samson Estap√©, Europe campaigns coordinator of the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), said. He added that on top of such a ban, the Norwegian government should also adopt a comprehensive embargo on direct and indirect arms trade and military cooperation with Israel and Israeli companies to ensure end-user compliance with international law. However, in a recent state budget proposal, the Norwegian government declared that it wouldn't support organisations that promote boycotts, investment stops and sanctions on Israel, polarising Norwegian parties. While the Christian Democrats stressed it was important to have a ‚Äúbalanced Middle East policy‚Äù and reject initiatives that ‚Äúcomplicate the peace process or promote a boycott of Israel‚Äù, the Reds, who have nominated the BDS for the Nobel Peace Prize, accused the government of ‚Äúpandering to Israel‚Äù, the news outlet ABC Nyheter reported. According to Reds leader Brynjar Moxnes, the BDS is not anti-Semitic at all. BDS describes itself as a Palestinian-led non-violent movement inspired by South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. Its stated goal is to put pressure on Israel to comply with UN resolutions and push it back to its 1967 borders. Israel and its allies, however, believe BDS goes beyond fighting the occupation and accuse the movement of anti-Semitism and for pushing to delegitimise and destroy the Jewish state. Some 27 of the US's 50 states have passed laws that prohibit or impede the BDS campaign. Earlier this year, German and Czech officials condemned the campaign.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): With elections slated for February looming over India‚Äôs capital city of Delhi, the state government has launched free bus services for women and deployed marshals to ensure their safety and security.",
    "articleText": "India‚Äôs capital of Delhi on Tuesday launched a free bus service for women in the city ‚Äì as promised by the state government a couple of months ago. Along with this, nearly 13,000 marshals have been deployed in the buses to ensure the safety of women passengers as the initiative takes off. The scheme launched by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has received a mix response from the general public. While some hailed the measure, many others said there was no need for such a populist move. As the move kicked off today, most of the women travellers were unaware of it. Many confused it with the one-day free ride that women in Delhi normally get during the festival Bhai Dooj, a Hindu sibling festival. ‚ÄúKejriwal spoke about it a few months ago, but I didn‚Äôt know from when it would come into effect. I am happy with the move as I can travel to my parental home within the city for free\", says Sharmila, a woman passenger while enjoying a free ride on the first day. Priyanshi, a high school student, said: ‚ÄúEverything has a value and we don‚Äôt mind paying for it. With such a move, the government is undermining the process of paying for the services provided\". A group of men at a bus depot unanimously demanded freebies. They said that even men can have financial crisis, so why only for women? ‚ÄúAll this is being done to derive political mileage. Otherwise, why such a policy just 3-4 months before elections?‚Äù asked one of the men standing there. ¬© Sputnik / Pratibha Sharma A poster of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that says rides are free for women, but they can pay for it if they wish Usha Sharma, a Delhi Civil Defence Personnel appointed as one of the marshals, said the move will be detrimental for the government. ‚ÄúI am not at all in favour of it. They talk of making metro and bus rides free for women. How will the government make up for the losses that it will incur through such policies?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúTickets are affordable as most of the women now earn. The maximum they could have done is giving a concession\", Usha added. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) staff had a different story to narrate. Terming the move an election gimmick, Piyush, a bus conductor distributing tickets, said by introducing such policies you are burdening the Department that‚Äôs already in loss. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the use of such a measure if women don‚Äôt get buses on time? If the department has so much money why don‚Äôt they make contract employees permanent?‚Äù Another bus conductor said: ‚ÄúThe government should focus on making the services better. Nearly 30-35 buses break down every day. The department needs more buses\". The state government has set aside $20 million (Rs.140 crore) to implement the scheme. There are 3,781 DTC buses and 1,808 cluster buses in the capital city. Chief Minister Kejriwal on Saturday unveiled 104 new cluster buses. Under the current project to increase the bus fleet, the cluster scheme is supposed to get 1,000 new standard-floor buses by February 2020. Nearly 129 of the 1,000 have been commissioned so far. ¬© Sputnik / Pratibha Sharma A broken down bus Starting on Tuesday, women can now travel free in DTC buses. Female passengers will have to approach the bus conductor who will hand over a pink ticket to them. This ticket is also to keep track of how many women are availing themeselves of the free-ride facility. The government estimates point out that female ridership makes up 33 percent of passengers every day.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Statistics are showing that in addition to over-the-top (OTT) content players, on-the-go music streaming apps are flourishing in India.",
    "articleText": "In the third quarter of 2019, Swedish music streaming giant Spotify witnessed 30 per cent growth in terms of its user-base in the third quarter of 2019 - between the months of July and October. ‚ÄúThis momentum was driven by a number of factors including the launch of our first broad-based marketing campaign, ‚ÄúSunte Ja‚Äù (‚ÄúListen On‚Äù), in February,‚Äù Spotify said in a statement late on Monday. Within the first week of its grand launch in Mumbai, Spotify clocked a quick million users in India. Roughly six months later, in August, the platform claimed to have garnered over 2 million active users each month. In addition, between July-October 2019, Spotify saw an upswing in premium subscribers in India, which grew by 31 per cent to reach 113 million. With the new-comer performing exponentially well, competition in the music-streaming industry seems to be intensifying in India. A previous report by market consulting firm Deloitte released earlier this year, suggested that the online music market in India is expected to surpass $273 million by 2020. At a time when domestic music streaming platforms like Gaana and JioSaavn are figuring out ways to strengthen their foothold in their own country, foreign players including Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube Music are seemingly flourishing in the country. Competing neck and neck in the fierce user-base battle, home-grown and international music streaming players slashed their monthly subscription fees in India drastically. While JioSaavn offers monthly premium subscription plans for $4 approx. (Rs. 299), Gaana, Apple Music and YouTube Music provide ad-free services for as little as $1.5 approx. (Rs. 99) per plan in India. On October 1, Spotify launched its new ‚ÄúPremium Family Plan‚Äù in India, allowing up to six members to enjoy premium services for $2.5 approx. (Rs.179) per month. Citing a recent survey by the CyberMedia Research (CMR) firm, media reports say that over 55 per cent of people in India are spending 30 per cent of their time listening to music. In a ranking of digital content engagement among Indian consumers in 2018, music emerged as the most accessed, downloaded and/or streamed category on a scale of 0 to 4 - with a ranking of 3.13 - followed by apps, movies and TV shows, newspapers and video games, according to database platform Statista.",

    "description": "Keith Vaz has been the Labour MP for Leicester East, a constituency with a large South Asian population, since 1987. He had a majority of 22,000 at the last general election.",
    "articleText": "A Labour MP has gone into hospital only hours after a parliamentary watchdog recommended he be suspended for six months over allegations he invited male prostitutes to his apartment and offered to buy them cocaine. The House of Commons Standards Committee said Keith Vaz, 62, committed a \"very serious breach\" of the code of conduct for MPs. In August 2016 the Sunday Mirror ran a front page story based on a sting operation in which two male prostitutes from Eastern Europe recorded an encounter with Vaz at an apartment in north London. It‚Äôs time for Labour MP Keith Vaz (aka) Jim the washing machine man needs to resign or be sacked by @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour immediately even his own constituents want him out @georgegalloway #ResignKeithVaz pic.twitter.com/2DiUlg5ZFj ‚Äî Mohammed Khan (@sarah_nowha1234) October 28, 2019 Vaz, who is married and was at the time the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee which was probing government drug policies, has always denied it was a sexual encounter. But his account of the meeting - which took place at 11.30pm on a Saturday night - has been greeted with hoots of derision and outright mockery on social media. The former Europe minister told the men he was a washing machine salesman called Jim and claimed later he thought they were decorators and had invited them to the apartment to discuss decorating it before he and his wife Maria could move in. Keith Vaz, speaking about one of the prostituted young men he had previously paid to abuse: \"what was his name, you brought me the first time? [ ‚Ä¶ ] He was OK. He forgot the condom though.

We have full confidence in our brilliant MP Keith Vaz who has served us in an outstanding way for 32 years and we hope that he will make a speedy recovery from his illness which sadly he has been forced to acknowledge publically. ‚Äî Leicester East Labour (@EastClp) October 28, 2019 The Sunday Mirror published photographs of the encounter as well as a transcription of an audio recording made on the night, in which a man believed to be Vaz mentions using condoms, cocaine and poppers (a recreational drug widely used by gay men). Keith Vaz has been seen jumping for joy .... pic.twitter.com/XcEoTfHTV7 ‚Äî Mark Haywood (@MarkHay70931724) October 28, 2019 In the watchdog‚Äôs report they say: ‚ÄúMr Vaz claims to have practically no recollection of what happened in the encounter with the two men. However, he has consistently maintained that the meeting was set up to discuss flat redecoration and that there is no evidence that the two men were ‚Äòprostitutes‚Äô.‚Äù Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, said: \"I found Mr Vaz's account of the events that led to the media reports incredible. I found his reason for being unable to assist me fully with my inquiry implausible.\" Vaz claimed he must have been given a \"spiked drink\" by the men but Ms Stone said this was \"not believable and, indeed, ludicrous.\" Ian Paisley was suspended for 30 sitting days.

He has produced material which purports to support this interpretation, including a statement apparently made by the mother of one of the men denying that her son is a prostitute, and allegations of various scams carried out by the men in Poland. His conclusion is that ‚Äòwhile the two individuals could accurately be described as conmen, it is quite wrong that they should ever have been described as prostitutes‚Äô.‚Äù Her report said: \"Mr Vaz has done his best to complicate, obfuscate and confuse the inquiry through arguments of little merit and documentation of dubious relevance.‚Äù There has been widespread shock on social media that it took more than three years for the report to be published into the incident.

He is a disgrace and has been for many years #SackKeithVaz ‚Äî George Galloway (@georgegalloway) October 28, 2019 Remarkably Vaz‚Äôs local constituency party in Leicester East has stood by him and tweeted their support for him continuing as their MP. If MPs vote to approve the committee's recommendation, Vaz could face a by-election if a recall petition is supported by 10 percent of his constituents. Such was the case with Labour MP Fiona Onasanya, who was forced to stand down in Peterborough after being jailed for lying over a speeding ticket. 1148 days after my complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, they have has upheld my complaint into Keith Vaz, his conduct during the enquiry shows he is not fit to represent anywhere in Parliament, Leicester deserves much better than this. ‚Äî Andrew Bridgen (@ABridgen) October 28, 2019 Vaz was born in Aden, then part of the British Empire, but his family originate in Goa, India. A former solicitor in London, he became MP for Leicester East in 1987, when he was 30, and has retained the seat ever since. Vaz, who is independently wealthy and owns several properties, is a member of Labour‚Äôs National Executive Committee and has remained close to Jeremy Corbyn despite his past as a Blairite junior minister.

He has a cardiovascular condition which would mean that were he to consume any non-prescribed drugs he would in all likelihood die.

    "description": "Scientists at Siberian Federal University have tested four biopolymers for compatibility with human and animal blood cells.",
    "articleText": "The authors of the study claim that these compounds have great potential for application in medicine. For example, in the future, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of postoperative complications in cardiovascular surgery through the use of biopolymers as a coating for vascular endoprostheses (stents). The results of the study were published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules magazine. According to Anna Shumilova, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biotechnology at Siberian Federal University, the number of cases of atherosclerosis is growing all over the world, with the highest risk of the disease in men aged 40-60-years-old. One treatment option is stenting the coronary heart vessels. A special supportive tube is inserted into the affected vessels; which when expanded broadens the lumen of the vessel and improves blood circulation. Unfortunately, sometimes postoperative complications occur, due to allergic reactions to the materials from which the stents are made. The body can reject such stents and react by overgrowing the implants with a cellular mass, which can endanger the patient‚Äôs life. Also, whenever a foreign body is introduced into an organism, platelets rush into the penetration zone and stick together to form blood clots, which can trigger a stroke or heart attack. To avoid postoperative complications, stents with a hypo-allergenic coating are required. For example, a polymer film composed of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Previously, researchers of SB RAS Krasnoyarsk Institute of Biophysics, together with specialists from the Shumakov Centre for the Transplantology of Artificial Organs, have already investigated the properties and interaction of PHA when coming into contact with blood cells in vitro. Recently SFU scientists conducted a ‚Äúcompatibility test‚Äù for four types of biopolymers, with different chemical compositions: two were rigid and highly crystalline while the other two had elastomeric (rubber-like) properties. As Anna Shumilova said, ‚Äúthe polymers for the experiments were obtained at the Biotechnology Laboratory for New Biomaterials at Siberian Federal University‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe polymer films were placed in special sterile trays with blood cells. During the experiment, red blood cells didn‚Äôt burst or deform; platelets and monocytes behaved as though they were in the bloodstream of a healthy organism, and macrophages showed normal behaviour on the surface of the films‚Äù, Shumilova added. According to Shumilova, ‚Äúthe study showed that the biopolymer ‚Äúshell‚Äù, which makes the metal coronary stent ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to the human immune system, will help significantly reduce the number of postoperative complications in cardiovascular surgery in the future‚Äù.",

    "description": "According to Leif √ñstling, former CEO of one of the world's leading truck manufacturers, immigration has spiralled out of control and has placed Sweden on the brink of ‚Äúinternal wars‚Äù, where military force may be needed to quell unrest in migrant areas.",
    "articleText": "In a lengthy interview with SwebbTV, the former Scania CEO has claimed that the arrival of new migrants poses severe integration problems and may have drastic repercussions for the Swedish economy and society as a whole. ‚ÄúNow this is a simple question there, and it's because we've taken in far too many people from outside. And we did. Those who come from the Middle East and Africa live in a society that we left almost a hundred years ago‚Äù, √ñstling said. Leif √ñstling described Sweden as an ‚Äúincredibly complicated society‚Äù, suggesting that a ‚Äúknowledge transfer‚Äù is required, but will take at least a whole generation. √ñstling cited his own experience of dealing with non-Swedish immigrants during his time at Scania, when manufacturing processes were much simpler, as opposed to today. ‚ÄúToday we have so much more sophisticated processes. And these are very difficult for these people to absorb and understand. We had a number of Somalis in Oskarshamn. It was close to a hundred. Not everyone managed. Partly because you had to arrive on time, and they weren't used to it. Partly due to team work, they were not used to it either. Of the hundred, only ten were able to stay. The rest went out into unemployment again‚Äù, √ñstling said. √ñstling also stressed migrants' criminal proclivities, which he ascribed to stemming from completely different living conditions and norms. According to √ñstling, more business executives share his views, but they are more cautious about expressing themselves publicly so as not to hurt the company. He stressed that orderliness is crucial for companies, as well as for societies in general. ‚ÄúThose who fail to embrace order and to settle down over time will fall apart and collapse‚Äù, √ñstling said. According to √ñstling, it is nevertheless possible to fix Sweden's problems within a decade. ‚ÄúWe must get it right. If this continues, we may end up in an uncontrolled situation where internal wars will erupt and we may be forced to deploy our military in these so-called vulnerable areas‚Äù, √ñstling said, alluding to dozens of heavily segregated no-go zones rife with crime and lawlessness. He also stressed that time is scarce to solve the problems. 74-year-old Leif Albert √ñstling led the Scania AB truck company for many years. In spring 2016, he was appointed chairman of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, a post he later left in November 2017, after it transpired that he had placed money abroad to avoid Swedish taxation. His comment ‚ÄúHere, you pay 20-30 million a year, what the hell do I get for the money?‚Äù went viral. Later, √ñstling said that the expletives were the only thing he actually regretted.",

    "description": "As debates on an early vote in December are in full swing at Westminster, the Treasury is about to recycle the first batch of coins that were produced to mark the initial Brexit Halloween deadline.",
    "articleText": "Although originally supposed to be minted in time for this Friday, 3 million commemorative 50p coins emblazoned with 31 October, the date the UK was scheduled to leave the European bloc, will now be recycled, HM Treasury has confirmed. The coins to mark the historic date of Britain going through the landmark constitutional change will, however, definitely see the light of day, a spokesman said. \"We will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the European Union, and this will enter circulation after we have left\", he stated. The dates on the coin may go on to change, but the text that the money will sport is known for sure and reads as follows‚Äì ‚ÄúPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\". The wording echoes third US president Thomas Jefferson's inaugural address, in which he vowed ‚Äúpeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations‚Äù with the caveat ‚Äúentangling alliances with none‚Äù. The initial batch of coins will be recycled now that the EU has agreed a Brexit extension of 31 January with Downing Street, days after the landmark deal was okayed by parliamentarians. Another 7 million were scheduled to be minted in the next several months, which is considerably more than the 10,000 commemorative coins originally planned under former chancellor Philip Hammond‚Äôs initiative. The expenses for the design and production will be fully covered by the Royal Mint out of its own revenues, with the coins coming at no cost to British taxpayers. While the EU has extended the withdrawal deadline until the end of January, the domestic turmoil over the deal persists. On Monday, 28 October, lawmakers rejected a motion to hold a new General Election for the third time, with the Commons set to vote again on Tuesday about holding a snap vote on 12 December, as Johnson‚Äôs Cabinet has proposed, arguing that ‚Äúthis Parliament had run its course\".",

    "description": "The congresswoman from California stated that she is leaving her post over reports of having had affairs with staffers. Although the Democrat admitted to having a sexual relationship with a campaign employee, she denies involvement with her legislative director in Congress, accusing her estranged husband and Republicans of waging a smear campaign.",
    "articleText": "Outgoing Representative Katie Hill, whose nude photos with a female lover were leaked to the media amid reports about affairs with campaign and congressional staffers, has pledged to fight so-called revenge porn after leaving Congress. ‚ÄúI will fight to ensure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced. Some people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation, others call it revenge porn. As the victim of it, I call it one of the worst things we can do to our sister and our daughters‚Äù, she said in a video address posted on YouTube without elaborating on how she is going to counter these problems. In the video, which came hot on the heels of Hill announcing her resignation, she lambasted what she described as a ‚Äúsmear campaign‚Äù, blaming her ‚Äúabusive husband‚Äù and ‚Äúhateful political operatives‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis coordinated campaign carried out by the right-wing media and Republican opponents, enabling and perpetuating my husband‚Äôs abuse by providing him a platform is disgusting and unforgivable‚Äù, Hill claimed in her address. Hill announced that she is resigning on Sunday amid a House ethics probe into allegations that she had a sexual relationship with a staffer from her congressional office, which is prohibited under House rules.

Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) October 27, 2019 She denied any improper involvement with the man in question - her Legislative Director Graham Kelly - admitting only that she had an \"inappropriate\" affair with a female campaign staffer. The scandal broke out two weeks ago, after Red State reported that Hill, who is openly bisexual, had developed a \"long-term sexual relationship\" with a staffer on her congressional campaign. The latter ultimately entered into a \"throuple\" with Hill's husband, Kenny Heslep, whom she is now trying to divorce. The conservative blog offered screenshots of several alleged text messages between Hill and the staffer, as well as intimate pictures, including a nude photo of the congresswoman. The outlet also indicated that the congresswoman had been having an affair with Graham Kelly, her legislative director and former campaign finance director, for at least a year. Later, The Daily Mail posted what is understood to be nude photos of Hill smoking marijuana in 2017, before the drug was legalised and named her lover, Morgan Desjardins. The outgoing representative threatened to file a lawsuit against the tabloid for posting private pictures without her consent. The allegations came out as Hill, who defeated Republican Representative Steve Knight in 2018 in her district, was facing several GOP rivals in her 2020 congressional campaign.",

    "description": "Washington has banned the Chinese tech giant's products from the American market and prohibited its companies from providing any technologies to Huawei. Beijing and the Chinese company have slammed the US's actions, with the firm even filing a lawsuit against them.",
    "articleText": "Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei has dismissed allegations that the US crackdown against his company severely affected its financial results in an interview with Euronews. \"I don't think the US allegations have hurt or affected us that much. In fact, the lobbying of so many politicians around the world has had a positive impact on Huawei. Seeing such a powerful country attack Huawei, customers in many countries take that as a sign of Huawei's strength\", he stated. Ren Zhengfei confirmed that some customers \"choose not to buy from Huawei\", calling their decision \"understandable\". At the same time, he argued that the US governments' actions are likely to be more damaging for American companies than to Huawei. \"Ultimately, it will be US companies that suffer most. If US companies will lose many parts of Chinese markets. This is not in their best interest\", the Huawei CEO said. The head of the Chinese giant said that the company is not going to engage with the US government over its actions other than by filing a lawsuit and is not going to comment on Washington's allegations. Ren Zhengfei noted that the \"facts will determine whether critics [of Huawei] are right\". Washington initiated its crackdown campaign against Huawei in May 2019, banning the company's products from US soil and prohibiting American firms from selling technologies to the Chinese giant. This led to chip and software producers withdrawing their partnership with Huawei and the company itself introducing plans to replace their products with similar analogues. Most notably, Huawei recently presented HarmonyOS, which will replace Android OS on some of Huawei's devices. CC BY 2.0 / KƒÅrlis DambrƒÅns / Huawei Huawei The US claims that Huawei allows the Chinese government to spy on its clients via embedded backdoors in its products and called on other countries to refrain from using the Chinese tech giant's equipment in 5G networks. Washington threatened to limit its intelligence sharing with allies, who ignore this warning. So far only a few countries around the world have followed the US recommendation. According to most recent reports, the UK is leaning towards allowing Huawei's equipment into the country's non-core 5G network structures, despite pressure from the US. The final decision on this matter may reportedly be made as early as this week, according to the Daily Mail citing unnamed sources.",

    "description": "The Daesh terrorist group has been severely weakened over the last two years, having lost most of the territory it previously occupied. However, many have expressed concern that the death of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend may potentially inspire new individuals or groups to carry out attacks.",
    "articleText": "British intelligence services have increased their monitoring of around 3,000 people in the UK and abroad who are believed to be linked to Daesh* or who could be inspired by the terrorist organisation to launch attacks in the country following the death of the group‚Äôs leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, The Guardian reported. While the overall threat level in the country remains ‚Äúsevere‚Äù - meaning that a terrorist attack is considered likely - MI5 has not raised the threat level to ‚Äúcritical‚Äù yet, which was invoked following the 2017 bombing attacks at the Manchester Arena and Parsons Green tube station. ¬© REUTERS / Ali Hashisho Daesh Reportedly Names Its New Leader Following US Operation to Eliminate Baghdadi Daesh remains the primary security concern in the UK even after al-Baghdadi‚Äôs death, as intelligence sources believe that many terrorist plots in the country stem from the organisation‚Äôs Middle Eastern supporters, which could potentially result in acts of revenge. However, they also point out that lone wolves, although not connected to terrorist organisations directly but who are often inspired by their actions, remain potentially dangerous, according to MI5, as they cannot be properly tracked and monitored. ‚ÄúThe most immediate concern will be that major terrorism events often prompt actions by copycats or in revenge‚Äù, terrorism expert and director at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank Rafaello Pantucci told The Guardian. An unnamed regional intelligence official also told Newsweek following al-Baghdadi‚Äôs death that the organisation is still able to inspire terrorist acts globally. ‚ÄúThey will hit Syria, the chaos of Iraq, Europe and definitely the United States‚Äù, said the official, who preferred to remain unnamed. On 27 October, President Donald Trump confirmed the death of Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi following a US military operation in Syria over the weekend. While the group is already believed to have named Abdullah Qardash - also known as Hajji Abdullah al-Afari - as their new leader, the terrorist organisation is thought to have been severely weakened by the loss of its previously held territories following advances by Syrian government forces and the military operation by the US-led international coalition. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist group banned in Russia.",

Unfortunately, two members, Xiumin and D.O., are unable to join the comeback due to their military service. Fans are super excited about the return and are curious what the concept is going to be this time. Supporters are trending the hashtag #EXOisComing in support of the band.

    "description": "According to recent statistics, 94 percent of immigrants who've arrived in Sweden since the migrant crisis of 2015, rely on state benefits.",
    "articleText": "The government-run website Sweden.se has landed in hot water for marketing Sweden abroad as a place where immigrants can receive very generous contributions and other bonuses, including health care. On the website, the reader is informed that Sweden has the world's longest parental leave and even provides illegal immigrants with dental care. The website also provides a detailed list of benefits and allowances. For instance, a family with six children receives a monthly SEK 4,240 ($430) and SEK 7,500 ($760) in multi-child allowances. The site is operated by the Swedish Institute (SI), a government body tasked with promoting the country's image abroad and promoting its interests. ‚ÄúI have no problem with signing up to the fact that we try to inform that Sweden is a welfare state. We have a system that sparks interest‚Äù, Per-Arne Wikstr√∂m, the head of communications at the Swedish Institute, told TV4. He also admitted that the purpose of the webpage is to inform of Sweden's priorities and potentially arouse interest in emigrating to the country. The ploy to portray Sweden as a country of benefits irked politicians and ordinary Swedes alike. According to the newspaper Aftonbladet, 94 percent of the asylum seekers that arrived in Sweden since 2015 rely on state benefits. Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson called the site completely unreasonable. According to him, it sends a ‚Äúcompletely wrong signal‚Äù about Sweden. ‚ÄúIncredible. The government's own authority markets Sweden abroad as a generous grant country. Everything in order to attract more people to Sweden. What Sweden needs is quotas in the welfare system and a strict migration policy. For a long time to come‚Äù, his party colleague Elisabeth Svantesson tweeted. Sansl√∂st.

As a result, Prime Minister Modi will have to take a circuitous route to land in Saudi Arabia late on Monday night for his two-day state visit. \"The Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), helps governments to cooperate, and only applies to the operations of civilian aircraft and not to state or military aircraft,\" the ICAO spokesperson said in a statement. \"Flights carrying national leaders are considered state aircraft, and are therefore not subject to ICAO provisions,\" he added.

New Delhi had then taken up the matter with the ICAO after yet again calling out Pakistan for denying flight clearance for a VVIP special flight, granted routinely by all countries. Last month, Islamabad had denied over flight clearance for Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs flight to Vladivostok to attend the 5th Eastern Economic Forum and to New York to attend the annual session of the UN General Assembly. Islamabad had also rejected a request by India to allow its President Ram Nath Kovind to use Pakistani airspace during his flight to Iceland ‚Äúin view of India‚Äôs behaviour‚Äù. Tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir have escalated since New Delhi revoked the special quasi-autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir State in the first week of August. Under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, Jammu and Kashmir had an autonomous constitution and could make its own decisions, except on matters of defence, foreign affairs, and communications. The Indian government‚Äôs new initiative stipulates that Jammu and Kashmir will be divided into two federal government administered territories from 31 October. Pakistan reacted angrily to what it described as an ‚Äúillegal‚Äù move, promising to protect Kashmiris. Islamabad expelled the Indian envoy, suspended bilateral trade and promised to raise the issue on every platform available to it, including the International Court of Justice. India and Pakistan have each been claiming the Kashmir region in full since the end of British colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Despite a ceasefire being agreed upon by both sides in 2003, violence and instability have shown no signs of abating.",

Xixapangma (8,027m), his last and 14th peak in this mission, on Tuesday and took to Twitter to announce his accomplishment. ‚ÄúMISSION ACHIEVED !‚Äù says @nimsdai from the summit of #Shishapangma #14peaks7months #History At 8:58 hrs local time, Nims and his team reached the summit of Shisha Pangma.

Everest, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Makalu in Nepal this spring before moving on to K2 in the Karakoram in Pakistan. Purja climbed five of Pakistan's highest peaks including Gasherbrum I, Gasherbrum II and K2, in the second phase of his mission. Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka completed the same feat after seven years, 11 months and 14 days in 1987 after Italy's legendary Reinhold Messner became the first to scale the 14 peaks in 1986. South Korean Kim Chang-ho completed the challenge one month slower than Kukuczka. The last record holder, Korean climber Kim Chang-ho, took eight years to climb the 14 peaks. Known for conducting rescue operations on summits, Purja rescued stranded climbers on Everest and Annapurna in the spring. He climbed Annapurna I (23 April), Dhaulagiri (12 May), Kanchenjunga (16 May) both Everest and Lhotse (23 May) and Makalu (25 May). Climbing those six peaks within 31 days was itself a record. Then he went on to climb Nanga Parbat (6 July), Gasherbrum I (15 July), Gasherbrum II (18 July), K2 (24 July) Broad Peak (26 July). He came back in the autumn to climb Cho Oyu (23 September) and Cho Oyu (27 September). Purja, a former Gurkha Special Forces Commando in the British Navy, started a crowdfunding website for Project Possible 14/7 - Nims dai. \"I firmly believe that everything in life is possible armed only with a measured approach and positive mind-set. My military career is behind me, I will strive to break more boundaries and help others move forward in their lives, realise their dreams and exceed my and their limitations,\" he wrote on his website. Congratulatory messages have been pouring in for Purja, ever since the announcement. Absolutely outstanding achievement Dai. We are all so proud of you.

    "description": "After US President Donald Trump confirmed the death of Daesh chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday following a US military operation in Syria, The Washington post published a controversial obituary for the terrorist leader, calling him an ‚Äúaustere religious scholar‚Äù, prompting widespread criticism from the public.",
    "articleText": "Counselor to the US president Kellyanne Conway ripped ‚Äúmedia interference‚Äù and The Washington Post's coverage of the death of Daesh* terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during her appearance on the Fox News show \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" on Monday, by calling the media‚Äôs obituary for the terrorist leader ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù and a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù. Conway blasted The Washington Post‚Äôs obituary headline that read ‚ÄúAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48‚Äù, by criticising the media for being ‚Äúangry‚Äù at Trump for conducting an operation that targeted the terrorist. ‚ÄúWhat was this yesterday from The Washington Post? This nonsense\", Conway said during the interview while showing the article‚Äôs headline. ‚ÄúThe media is angry at the president of the United States for getting rid of the world's worst terrorists. It‚Äôs like ‚Äòwho is he to interfere, when we are trying to impeach him‚Äô‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey went to the magnitude and the duplicity yesterday of trying to... undercut the commander in chief making the order and... honestly doing something that helped the whole country and the world, freedom-loving people everywhere ‚Äì this man was a murderer, a rapist, a terrorist..‚Äù, she continued.

The White House counselor also said that she was ‚Äúsick and tired of media interference trying to undo the last elections results‚Äù and trying to influence the next one. When referring to an ongoing inquiry run by US Attorney John Durham over concerns that Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign could have been improperly surveilled, Conway stated that US citizens deserved to know the origins of the Russian investigation. On 27 October, US President Donald Trump announced that Daesh leader al-Baghdadi had died by detonating suicide vest after being chased to the end of an underground tunnel during a US raid. The Russian Defence Ministry, however, has said that it possessed no reliable data regarding the US operation and questioned its credibility. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist group banned in Russia.",

    "description": "US reporter James Foley worked as conflict reporter for several media organisations covering events in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan. He was beheaded by Daesh militants in 2014 in a video that the group posted online.",
    "articleText": "US President Donald Trump has personally called the parents of US journalist James Foley, beheaded by Daesh* terrorists in 2014, to inform them of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the terrorist group. Government officials first warned the Foleys about the statement and later the head of state phoned the family. Diane Foley said she was ‚Äúgrateful for that kindness‚Äù and for finding the leader of the most notorious terrorist group. James Foley worked as a conflict journalist for GlobalPost and AFP when he was kidnapped in Syria in 2012 by an unknown gang and was later detained by Daesh militants. He was brutally killed by militants in what Daesh claimed was a response to the US military campaign in Iraq. In a telephone conversation with Donald Trump, Diane Foley urged the president to try the remaining members of the Beatles squad ‚Äì a group of Brits that were involved in the execution of Foley and other captives ‚Äì that are now in US custody. Diane Foley stressed that a US trial would be the best way to deal with all terrorists and that she would have preferred US forces capture Baghdadi alive so that he too could have appeared in court. Diane Foley also posted a statement on the James Foley Foundation website, saying she was concerned about other US hostages held in Syria and said she would ask President Trump to make their rescue a national priority. US President Donald Trump said Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had died during a special operation conducted by US forces. Trump said the number one terrorist ‚Äúcried and whimpered‚Äù as he ran from service dogs into a dead-end tunnel where Baghdadi eventually detonated his suicide vest. Russia and United Nations team on terrorist groups have cast doubt on Trump‚Äôs announcement, saying Baghdadi‚Äôs death has to be confirmed. President Trump claims that although Baghdadi‚Äôs body was mutilated by the blast, a subsequent DNA test had confirmed the corpse belonged to the Daesh leader. Foley‚Äôs parents believe that the death of Baghdadi is not the end of Daesh. His father, John Foley said Daesh is ‚Äúlike grass. You mow it, but it continues to grow. And I don‚Äôt think that the elimination of al-Baghdadi is the final answer\". Diane Foley said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to be ready for retaliation, and they‚Äôre not defeated yet\".",

Biden had to denounce his decades-long opinion on the issue and said that women must have full and fair access to reproductive care, including abortion.",
    "articleText": "Ex-Vice President and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden was denied Holy Communion on Sunday, when he arrived at a church in South Carolina, because of his stance on abortion. According to the South Carolina Morning News, the incident occurred in the city of Florence. Father Robert E. Morey told the local newspaper that he \"had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden\". ¬© REUTERS / Carlos Jasso Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden reacts as he delivers a speech during the Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, U.S. October 17, 2019 \"Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching‚Ä¶ I will keep Mr Biden in my prayers\", the priest said in his statement. At the moment, Biden's office hasn't commented on the decision. The politician, who is the only Catholic candidate from the Democratic Party in the upcoming elections, was denied Communion by the priest as the Roman Catholic Church believes that human life is sacred from the moment of conception, and, therefore holds a hard line on the issue. Holy Communion is one of the Christian sacraments that descends from the Last Supper. Believers consume consecrated bread and wine, referring to it as the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ.",

    "description": "In July 2018, Ivanka Trump announced the termination of her namesake fashion brand in order to focus on government work. The decision followed accusations of conflict of interest that emerged from the US first daughter‚Äôs increased involvement in foreign affairs while continuing to promote her brand.",
    "articleText": "American attorney and former director of the US Office for Government Ethics Walter Shaub has questioned Presidential Advisor Ivanka Trump on whether she indeed closed down her namesake fashion brand IT Collection LLC in July of last year, following reports that the first daughter‚Äôs company had won several trademark approvals from China months after it was supposedly shuttered. Citing an article by watchdog organisation Citizens for Ethics, which claimed that Ivanka Trump‚Äôs fashion brand won approval for 16 new trademarks from the Chinese government in October 2018, Shaub wrote on his Twitter account that it was particularly ‚Äúfunny‚Äù that Ivanka Trump‚Äôs brand did not cease applying for trademarks, despite declaring its closure on 24 July 2018. He also raised doubts about whether the president‚Äôs daughter stopped making money from licensing deals. ‚ÄúI, for one, look forward to seeing Ivanka Trump's financial disclosure for calendar year 2019 in May 2020\", Walter Shaub wrote. I, for one, look forward to seeing Ivanka Trump's financial disclosure for calendar year 2019 in May 2020. Funny how they didn't abandon the trademark applications after \"shutting down\" the brand.

If not, what's \"shut down\" mean? https://t.co/b6lW8o8Pb8 ‚Äî Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 27, 2019 In November 2018, the Associated Press reported that China had granted 18 trademarks to companies linked to Ivanka Trump and the US president over the two previous months, bringing the total number of approvals granted by China that year to 34, including trademarks covering handbags, shoes, jewelry, and other fashion items. This came three months after Ivanka Trump announced the dissolution of her namesake brand citing her government work in the White House. ¬© AP Photo / Evan Vucci Louis Vuitton Art Director Slams Trump Days After President and Ivanka Visit Brand‚Äôs Workshop Many ethics watchdogs have raised concerns about conflicts of interest over Ivanka Trump‚Äôs advisory position in the White House and business activities. In particular, over Ivanka's brand receiving numerous Chinese trademark approvals shortly before Donald Trump announced that he was planning to lift sanctions against Chinese telecom company ZTE. IT Collection LLC also received three new Chinese trademarks the same day Ivanka Trump dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping back in 2017. In July 2018, Ivanka Trump declared that shutting down the brand was ‚Äúthe only fair outcome‚Äù for her team and partners following the concerns raised, but said at the time that she was not sure whether she would return to business. ‚ÄúAfter 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington\", Trump said at that time. While Ivanka Trump hasn't publicly commented on the issue yet, the possibility that she could resume her business following her the departure from the White House remains, because the US first daughter still retains ownership over all the trademarks she's received.",

Some people also heavily criticised fake news mongers for spreading unnecessary rumours and speculation on the web about the twin World Cup-winning Indian captain.

    "description": "The man's wife feared he was suffering from psychosis because he had allegedly smoked hash procured in Copenhagen's anarchist Freetown Christiania, whose main artery is called Pusher Street.",
    "articleText": "A 33-year-old Muslim with a Swedish residence permit has been arrested in Denmark following a major police operation. The man, who is suspected of being radicalised, has issued death threats against Danish and Swedish royals, as well as anti-immigrant Danish politician Rasmus Paludan, the Danish newspaper Extra Bladet reported. His wife stated that the man's behaviour had changed over the past few weeks. For instance, he became secretive and changed the screen on the computer every time she approached. He started hearing voices about religious things, and his wife's sister claimed he was writing ‚Äústrange things‚Äù on Facebook. ‚ÄúI cut the head of Queen [Margrete II] and the whole [Danish] Royal family. I have warned, and I won't go for anything other than the throat‚Äù, the man reportedly wrote on Facebook. In another instance, the man claimed that all Danes belong to Satan and pledged to ‚Äúkill as many people as there are stars‚Äù. The man has been charged with five specific threats written between 16 and 24 October. Aside from the Danish Queen, he threatened Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf. ‚ÄúLast warning to the Swedish police and border police, if I do not receive an answer soon, then, with God's will, I will put down the state and the king, even if I am then forced to sever his head from his body‚Äù, the man wrote. He posted a photo of Rasmus Paludan, the leader of right-wing anti-immigrant party Stram Kurs, which has a habit of burning the Quran to celebrate freedom of speech in Denmark. ‚ÄúIf you are a man, show your face in public, and if you burn the words of the Quran, I will burn entire Denmark including you‚Äù, the man wrote. The man's wife feared he was suffering from psychosis as he daily went to Christiania, Copenhagen's frivolous hippie quarter where hash is sold openly, to smoke hashish, and she had urged him to seek out a psychologist. The wife was frightened he would turn violent, so she reported him to the local imam and then to the Copenhagen Police. The man has been jailed for 10 days and charged with making threats to do bodily harm. The wife said she was scared of her husband if he was released, she explained to the police. The arrested man has a residence permit in Sweden, where he works in health care, but he lives with his wife and daughter in Copenhagen, from where he commutes to work every day in Malm√∂. In court, the 33-year-old explained that he was a praying Muslim, but not overwhelmingly interested in religion and had recently grown a beard ‚Äúto see how it looks‚Äù.",

New Delhi had also reportedly denied permission to US Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who claimed he was not given not cleared to visit by the Indian government, which claimed it was ‚Äúnot an appropriate time‚Äù to visit Kashmir. Last week, the apex court had asked the federal government about the timeline for removing restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir.

    "description": "While the UK continues to slide into Brexit madness as the deadline for leaving the EU has been extended to January 2020 and MPs are now to vote for a new election, supposed to take place on 12 December, there does seem to be a method to it. London now has several options to break the impasse.",
    "articleText": "The British government, headed by Boris Johnson, will try to alter the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which requires the support of two-thirds (or 434) of all MPs to announce a snap election, after lawmakers rejected a motion to hold a new vote for the third time on 28 October. The House of Commons is to vote on Tuesday about holding an early election on 12 December, as Johnson‚Äôs Cabinet wishes. The vote follows the EU agreeing to reschedule the deadline from 31 October (Halloween Brexit) to 31 January 2020. The move has left Johnson with room to manoeuvre as he needs approval for his ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù agreement. Johnson had earlier pledged to see the UK out of the bloc by the end of October ‚Äúdo or die‚Äù. However, even though a simple majority is enough to secure the 29 October vote, Parliament can still try to change it, as the BBC points out. Additionally, two opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, who have a short bill of their own for an election on 9 December, could refuse to support Johnson‚Äôs version. Another path that could lead to a new general election is a no-confidence vote in the Cabinet. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier promised to push for this option. If a simple majority is secured, the current government or its alternative under a new leader needs to win a vote of confidence over 14 days or resign. According to Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University, Tuesday is a critical day, \"less for Brexit itself, and much more for the likelihood of a snap General Election in December\". \"The Boris Johnson bid for an election on 12 December predictably failed yesterday but he will try again today through a different mechanism that requires a lower threshold. There‚Äôs also a chance that the SNP/Liberal Democrat motion for a 9th December General Election might (just) get sufficient support to get over the line today, as it requires a simple rather than a two-thirds majority. This is very much a second best option for Johnson as it permits amendments and is predicated on the WAB not being tabled again\", she says. The professor further explains: \"It‚Äôs always been seen as risky for the Conservatives to head to the polls without Brexit having been 'delivered', and especially with Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party chomping at the bit to accuse Johnson and the Conservatives of having failed to deliver Brexit again. Having said that, few expect a General Election to 'solve' Brexit, given no election is ever decided on a binary basis, plus the voters might well deliver another hung parliament. Many argue that it is only a referendum on the deal/remain that can do that. We might, by this evening, be facing our first Winter General Election for over 40 years or we might still be in the same position, with no Brexit, no election date and an ill-functioning Government and Parliament\". If Johnson‚Äôs attempt to get MPs on board a new deal fails, aside from leaving the EU without an agreement, the option of a new referendum is still on the table. This, however, seems likely only with a new Cabinet. The UK could hold both an advisory vote, leaving the government an opportunity to decide as in 2016, or a legally binding vote, a \"confirmatory\" referendum to choose a certain Brexit deal (or no-deal) and giving up on the divorce. Yet, as the BBC notes, citing experts, the three months until the current deadline ends in January 2020 will not be enough. ¬© AP Photo / Matt Dunham Pro-EU supporters protest during rally in London, Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019. Parliament was reconvening Tuesday for a pivotal day in British politics as lawmakers challenge British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's insistence that the U.K. will leave the European Union on Oct. 31, 2019 even without a deal Cancelling Brexit altogether is also legally possible, if Article 50 is revoked, as, for example, the Liberal Democrats promised to do if they win an election. However, a new vote as well as its outcome, is in question if Johnson sticks to his pledge to deliver Brexit no matter what. Andreas Bieler, Professor of Political Economy at School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham, has as well expressed his views on the continuing Brexit deadlock in the British parliament. \"After failing to secure acceptance of his Brexit deal and leaving the EU on 31 October, Prime Minister Johnson now wants an early election to secure a 'functioning parliament'. He suggests 12 December. Labour continues to resist this arguing that it first wants to see no-deal off the agenda. In my view, underlying this hesitation is, however, also an understanding that a general election purely based on Brexit is likely to damage the party's chances, as it is internally split over the issue\". According to him, Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party seeks \"to fight the next elections over economic and social issues, addressing the rampant inequality in British society\", while the SNP and the Liberal Democrats envisage \"to benefit from an election over Brexit, as both are open supporters of a remain position\". They would, however, prefer an earlier date to make sure that students are still at their universities and \"able to vote\", he emphasises. Although Johnson has been demanding a general election for almost two months, he lived through another fiasco on 28 October. British MPs voted to reject a General Election on 12 December in a crucial vote. Johnson failed to secure the backing of the two-thirds of the 650 MPs required by law to pass the motion as a total of 299 MPs voted in support of the PM‚Äôs proposal, while Labour MPs chose to abstain. Boris Johnson‚Äôs government tabled a motion for a general election on 12 December after it said that \"nobody relishes a winter election\", but that this Parliament had \"run its course‚Äù. \"Overall, there is a large level of uncertainty including for the Conservatives, as nobody can foresee the exact role the Brexit party may play in an early election, which emphasises Brexit as the main issue. Whatever is going to happen, the Brexit saga has completely unsettled the British political system and is highly likely to continue doing so over the next years\", Bieler concludes.",

    "description": "The tech visionary‚Äôs public spat with a caver that he called a paedophile took a new twist after it was reported this month that Musk had hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on the man.",
    "articleText": "Elon Musk will go on trial in December in a defamation case against him after a judge rejected Musk's request to dismiss a suit filed by British caver Vernon Unsworth. US district judge Stephen Wilson said the jury would decide whether the 48-year-old engineer was negligent in checking the statements he made in his posts on Twitter about Mr Unsworth. The caver‚Äôs lawyer noted that the burden of proof for negligence is lower than for actual malice. The defamation case centres on the run-in Musk and Unsworth had last year during an operation to save Thai schoolboys trapped in a cave. Musk and his team came up with a concept of a mini-submarine that could be used in a rescue operation. Unsworth in an interview with CNN called the idea ‚Äúa PR stunt‚Äù and added that the tech visionary ‚Äúcould stick his submarine where it hurts‚Äù. Musk did not mince words and called Unsworth a ‚Äúpaedo guy‚Äù, although he later apologised. Yet just a month later, he sent an email to a BuzzFeed reporter that was later published by the agency, in which he called the caver a child rapist. This month it was reported that one of Musk‚Äôs aides hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on Unsworth. It subsequently turned out that the detective was a convict. In an allegedly off the record email to a BuzzFeed reporter the tech visionary claimed Unsworth had married a 12-year-old girl in Thailand. Mr Unsworth said he met his wife in London when she was 32 years old. Despite all the setbacks, Musk‚Äôs lawyer Alex Spiro seemed positive, saying: ‚ÄúWe look forward to the trial. We understand that, while Musk has apologised, Unsworth would like to milk his 15 minutes of fame\".",

    "description": "On Sunday, Donald Trump confirmed that Daesh* leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed in a US attack at his hiding place in Syria, adding that he ‚Äúdied like a dog, like a coward‚Äù.",
    "articleText": "The problem of the terrorist group Daesh* and the jihadist cause in general is far from being solved even as its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been confirmed dead, Sweden's leading terrorism researcher Magnus Ranstorp of the National Defence College, warned, predicting a ‚ÄúDaesh 3.0‚Äù with new leaders. With the death of al-Baghdadi who at one point proclaimed himself ‚ÄúCaliph over all Muslims‚Äù, the terrorist organisation, which previously lost its so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq, suffered yet another major setback, but is far from being completely defeated, he stressed. ‚ÄúIt's not based on a single leader. There have been many of them. They do not depend on Baghdadi being alive, but of course it's a setback. Still, they are far from defeated, though Trump will probably use it in the election campaign and claim that [Daesh] is completely knocked out. They are not‚Äù, Magnus Ranstorp warned in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK. ‚ÄúDaesh will resurface. There will be a Daesh 3.0 with new leadership. New leaders are waiting in the background, and will take over‚Äù, Ranstorp stressed. According to Ranstorp, Daesh already began to prepare for threats to the ‚Äúcaliphate‚Äù in 2015 by spreading out its leadership and establishing new units. He also emphasised that the ideology still exists, and that propaganda material is still available online. Al-Baghdadi himself appointed his own successor, ex-Iraqi soldier Abdullah Qardash, whose position as ‚Äúlegislator‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical adviser‚Äù with Daesh earned him the nickname The Professor. Ranstorp predicted that Daesh will remain in the background for a bit and they will try and rebuild, employing two well-known strategies ‚Äì namely, disrupting the reconstruction of war-torn areas, and liberating prisoners who can be recruited. ‚ÄúThere are people with Daesh affiliation lurking in the shadows, and they still exist in several other places. We are far from having solved this problem‚Äù, Ranstorp stressed.. ‚ÄúThey cultivate children to become the next generation to take over. It's going to take time, but there are individuals working frenetically on this in Syria and several other places‚Äù, Ranstorp concluded, referring to camps for Daesh brides and children. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump announced that al-Baghdadi had been hunted into an underground tunnel by military dogs during a US raid, whereupon he detonated a suicide vest, blowing up himself and three of his children. Following his death, a number of countries, including the UK and the Philippines, stepped up security measures. * Daesh (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Islamic State) is a terrrorist organisation banned in Russia and other countries",

    "description": "A federal judge has reversed his previous ruling and allowed Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann to proceed with a defamation lawsuit against The Washington Post, after first dismissing the case.",
    "articleText": "On Monday, after reviewing an amended complaint, Judge William Bertelsman ruled that the case could enter the discovery phase and hence a portion of the lawsuit against the newspaper could continue. Nick and his attorneys said a Washington Post article conveyed that Nick had assaulted or physically intimidated Nathan Phillips and engaged in racist conduct after a Right to Life March, in Washington DC, on 18 January. The video that went viral showed Sandmann and Phillips, a Native American who was demonstrating that day, standing close to each other in a crowd, with Sandmann staring at Phillips as he played the drum. Sandmann's lawyers argued that The Washington Post incorrectly characterised the teen as the aggressor in the situation and exposed him to public ridicule, making the MAGA hat-wearing teen a target of the anti-Trump media. The Washington Post has admitted to the existence of vague \"subsequent reporting\" but neither retracted nor apologised to Sandmann In the ruling, Bertelsman said he stands by his decision that 30 of the 33 statements Sandmann's lawyers had argued were libellous were not, but that \"justice requires\" a further review of three of the statements. \"These three statements state that (Sandmann) 'blocked' Nathan Phillips and 'would not allow him to retreat'\", the order reads. Bertelsman said the amended complaint also argues that Phillips \"deliberately lied\" and \"had an unsavoury reputation\". The new complaint also states The Washington Post should have known about Phillips due to previous coverage of him. Sandmann's attorneys also filed lawsuits against CNN, NBCUniversal, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, The New York Times' Maggie Haberman, comedian Kathy Griffin, and several other representatives of the liberal media. The outcomes of these lawsuits have yet to be revealed.",

    "articleText": "The presidential talks are expected to feature topics related to the Russian-Cuban strategic partnership in various areas, as well as the international agenda. The meeting between Diaz-Canel and Medvedev will be focused on bilateral cooperation specifically in trade, investments, energy, industry, transport, agriculture, humanitarian, as well as other areas. The sides are also expected to tap into the implementation of agreements reached pursuant to the Russian prime minister's official visit to Cuba earlier in October. Russian-Cuban High-Level Dialogue The Cuban leader's official visit to Russia began on Sunday in the country's second largest city St. Petersburg. He was received by Chairman of the Committee for External Relations of St. Petersburg Evgeny Grigoriev as well as the Cuban ambassador to Russia. On Monday, he held talks with St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov and visited the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, dedicated to the victims of the 1941-1944 Siege of Leningrad during World War II. Russia's presidents have paid a total of three official visits to Cuba: Medvedev in 2008, and Putin in 2000 and 2014. In 2014, Putin's visit brought about a set of agreements signed regarding bilateral cooperation in international info-security, energy, industry, culture, and health care. At the time, the Russian president also held talks with Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and First Secretary of Cuba's Communist Party Raul Castro. ¬© AP Photo / Jorge Rey A taxi passes a sign with Cuban President Fidel Castro Diaz-Canel visited Moscow in 2018 as President of Cuba's Council of State. Diplomatic relations between the two states were established in 1902, with a brief pause from 1952-1960. At the core of the nations' bilateral cooperation are the 1996 Declaration of Principles of Russian-Cuban relations and the 2009 Memorandum on Principles of Strategic Partnership. Since then a high-level dialogue between Moscow and Havana has been maintained on a continuous basis. Broad Scope of Moscow-Havana Relations, Both at the State and Regional Level Earlier in the day, the Cuban president and St. Petersburg governor outlined new areas for potential cooperation. In May 2018, Russia and Cuba signed an agreement on the facilitation of a visa regime authorising a mutual permit for up to a 90-day visa-free stay. The agreement was signed by Ricardo Cabrisas, the vice president of Cuba's Council of Ministers and Minister of economy and planning, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. ¬© Sputnik / Vladimir Astapkovich Visitor of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF)-2019 The countries' bilateral trade demonstrates a tendency for growth, having increased 33.7 percent from 2017 to 2018 and another 1.3 percent in 2019. At the core of Russian-Cuban trade is energy and the metal industries. Russia's exports to Cuba are predominantly machinery, equipment and transport means, food and agricultural products, metals and metal goods, minerals, chemicals, wood, and paper. Imports from Cuba include foods and agricultural products, machinery, metals, minerals, and chemicals. The two countries cooperate in education and science, with the priority areas being astronomy, geophysics, agriculture, paleontology, and material science. Cuban students have an annual quota of 100 spots with scholarships at colleges in Russia.",

At that time, a Sony press release announcing the game noted that the company \"will continue to expand the software portfolio with an attractive title lineup and deliver entertainment experiences that are only possible on PlayStation\" Kojima described his first Konami-free solo project as a \"collaboration with PlayStation\" in a video with Sony CEO Andrew House, adding that he was \"thrilled to embark on creating a new franchise with PlayStation.\" And the game's 2018 E3 trailer even led off with a large \"Only on PlayStation\" banner. However, other older Sony press materials, including that 2016 press release, were careful to only call the game a \"console exclusive\" on PS4, meaning a PC release was still a possibility. When Kojima Productions was officially unveiled in 2015, a Medium-posted Q&A, now deleted, said directly that the company's first game \"is planned to become available on PC (after PS4).\" Death Stranding's PC publisher, 505 Games, has not announced which digital storefronts the game will be available on, yet the publisher‚Äôs most recent game, Control, was launched as an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC, thanks in part to an apparent $10.5 million upfront revenue guarantee from Epic itself.",

    "articleText": "\"There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis\", a review of trial evidence collected over almost 40 years shows. The review, published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry on Monday, points to the particular detrimental effects of cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical compound from the cannabis plant, and tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs) that have been linked to the deadly vaping-related lung injury. \"Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study ‚Ä¶ Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events ‚Ä¶ and withdrawals due to adverse events ‚Ä¶ compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined\", the new study revealed.

    "description": "The A Star Is Born singer and actress sparkled in her blue periwinkle gown at the 6 January awards event, but shortly afterwards the couture garment was reportedly left behind in the singer‚Äôs room at the hotel that hosted the iconic star-studded show.",
    "articleText": "A chic couture dress worn by Lady Gaga at the 2019 Golden Globes has been listed on an auction platform by a hotel maid who claims it was ‚Äúleft‚Äù for her by the performer, adding she has been working at the awards for the past 24 years and is well aware of the hotel policies. She claimed she had immediately taken the periwinkle gown to the lost and found department after finding it in Lady Gaga's room in September, months after the January ceremony. As per hotel policy, cited by the maid in a letter accompanying the listed item, the garment was kept for a certain stint of time there, before it was given to her. However, the story enjoyed another twist, as TMZ sources now claim that the dress was not Lady Gaga's to gift to any third party, or leave behind, as it remains the property of design house Valentino. The latter is reportedly claiming that the gown was actually ‚Äústolen‚Äù, according to the sources, who noted that Valentino, helmed by designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, ‚Äúhas either gone to police or plans to go to cops‚Äù in order to report the theft. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that the couture dress, with its 10-foot long train, could have been designed specifically for New York-born Gaga, presumably in a nod to a similar item worn by Judy Garlandin the original 1954 version of A Star is Born in 1954. Both Valentino and Lady Gaga have yet to comment on the matter. Those interested can find the famous violet-bluish custom dress on Nate D. Sanders Auctions, with the bids starting at $8,000 on Thursday.",

While DNA testing has been used to identify the Daesh leader‚Äôs body, questions concerning both the operation and Baghdadi‚Äôs location in general are still up for consideration.",

Gen. Igor Konashenkov described the US‚Äô lingering presence in Syria and subsequent refortification around oil-rich fields in al-Hasakah Governorate as \"international state banditism.‚Äù One company brought up by Konashenkov was the US-controlled ‚ÄúSadcab‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúSedcab‚Äù). Although created with the support of the local Kurdish community, the profit funds line the pockets of US-affiliated intelligence services and military contractors. Sleboda expounded on the defense official‚Äôs point, noting that the US‚Äô proceeds from the oil smuggling are being used to back Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúblack and military ops ‚Ä¶ in the region.‚Äù Oil aside, the analyst likened Trump‚Äôs embellished speech and claims of Baghdadi whimpering and crying to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2011 ‚Äúwe came, we saw, he died‚Äù comment concerning former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. As for the raid itself, Sleboda found a number of interesting things related to the raw details of the nighttime operation. He first pointed out that Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, which is located in northwest Syria - ‚Äúa territory even the Western press acknowledges is controlled almost entirely by al-Qaeda,‚Äù an entity historically hostile to Daesh. ‚ÄúThis is odd that Baghdadi would flee to Idlib, [which is] controlled by what are now his enemies,‚Äù he contended, seeing as how there is something of a competition to be the ‚Äútop dog of the jihadist groups.‚Äù Furthermore, the Daesh leader was killed just five miles from Syria‚Äôs border with Turkey. ‚ÄúTo get there, Baghdadi would‚Äôve had to cross a lot of hostile territory. Territory controlled by Kurds, by Americans, by Turkish-backed militants, by the Syrian government and Russia,‚Äù Sleboda said. ‚ÄúOr, of course, he could‚Äôve just taken a bus into Turkey and back through, considering the porous nature of the Turkish border that [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan has had with Idlib and their supplies,‚Äù such as ‚Äúoil and other resources.‚Äù He went on to highlight that it can be presumed that Washington did not trust Erdogan, as the military operation was carried out not from the US‚Äô NATO ally Turkey, but instead from Erbil, Iraq, which forced troops to go through ‚Äúlots of hostile territory and airspace in Syria.‚Äù The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "The legal counsel who represented Russian national Maria Butina told Sputnik Monday the US government‚Äôs treatment of his client was intended to give the impression she was a spy. Butina returned to Russia Saturday following more than a year in a US prison.",
    "articleText": "Butina returned to Moscow Saturday after being imprisoned for over a year at the Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution for a single charge of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent. https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/maria-butina-released-from-prison-what-h Robert Driscoll, who leads the Washington, DC, office of the law firm of McGlintchey Stafford and represented Butina, told Radio Sputnik‚Äôs Loud & Clear Monday that the US government‚Äôs treatment of Butina was ‚Äúabsurd.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe was never charged as a spy ... but I think the government either thought or wanted to give the impression she was a spy from the way they treated her. They arrested her without warning. I had been in touch with the US Attorney's Office, we knew there was an investigation before, her apartment had been searched. I said, ‚ÄòLook, we‚Äôre transparent. I can give you all the documents you need. I'll sit down, I‚Äôll possibly bring her in. You can talk to her. You can see there‚Äôs nothing to this.‚Äô And they just wouldn't return my calls and eventually arrested her in July of 2018 - and even more shockingly, said she‚Äôs a flight risk and moved to deny bail, which is amazing for a student who had no money, who had rented a U-Haul to go to South Dakota,‚Äù Driscoll told hosts John Kiriakou and Brian Becker. ‚ÄúI was very shocked that the government took that position,‚Äù he continued, also noting that the ‚Äúnotion that she was a flight risk was absurd‚Äù because there were many opportunities she could have taken to flee but didn‚Äôt. After being arrested in Washington, DC, on charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent on behalf of the Russian government, Butina initially pleaded not guilty. In December 2018, after a prolonged period of solitary confinement, she entered a plea deal on a single charge of conspiring to act as an illegal foreign agent. The original charge of acting as an unregistered agent was dropped as part of the agreement with prosecutors, Sputnik reported. ‚ÄúThe sentencing was complicated and unfortunate in my view, but the government did give her what is called a 5K1.1 letter, which is a substantial assistance letter authorizing the judge to enter a lower sentence if the judge wanted to, and the prosecution doesn‚Äôt give those to you if they think you‚Äôre lying. So they clearly believed her when she said she wasn‚Äôt a spy, that she wasn‚Äôt working for the Russians, that she wasn‚Äôt directed by a Russian intelligence agency. They knew all of that, and yet they persisted with seeking what I thought was an outrageously long sentence ‚Ä¶ they knew that she didn‚Äôt know of any obligation to notify the attorney general,‚Äù Driscoll added. Butina was charged under US Code ¬ß‚ÄØ951, which states: ‚ÄúWhoever, other than a diplomatic or consular officer or attacheÃÅ, acts in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without prior notification to the attorney general ‚Ä¶ shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both,‚Äù according to Cornell Law School. ‚ÄúNo one in the history of this statute has ever notified the attorney general that they are in the country acting as a foreign agent, because what it‚Äôs designed for - it‚Äôs essentially a legal hook. It‚Äôs designed for when the government finds an actual sleeper agent in the country so they can arrest that person without waiting for them to do any espionage. So they make it a crime to be in the country as a foreign agent without having notified the attorney general,‚Äù Driscoll said. Butina has been likened in the media to Anna Vasilyevna Chapman, a Russian intelligence agent who was arrested in the US on June 27, 2010, for espionage on behalf of the Russian Federation's external intelligence agency. However, according to Driscoll, there are no similarities between the two, because in Chapman‚Äôs case, there was evidence of conspiracy. ‚ÄúThere was nothing resembling that in her [Butina‚Äôs] case. There were no dead drops. There were terabytes of info that the government got out of her [Butina‚Äôs] apartment. And you know how many classified documents they found? Zero,‚Äù Driscoll said. ‚ÄúThe government acknowledged to me directly that nothing she did in the US was illegal but for the absence of the registration.‚Äù The Department of Justice had also accused the Russian national of trading sex for favors in the DC political sphere, but later retracted those comments. ‚ÄúThe sex stuff was utter BS. There was no basis to it ‚Ä¶ there was no evidence for it. The government acknowledged that, but as you said, the damage is done online,‚Äù Driscoll added. According to Driscoll, Butina is just happy to be home now, though she has ‚Äúmixed views‚Äù about the US. ‚ÄúOverall she likes the American people, and she likes the country. Not surprisingly, she‚Äôs got her qualms about the justice system at this point,‚Äù he noted. The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

However, the Daesh leader detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children and wounding the dog. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told reporters Monday the name of the dog remains classified to protect the identities of members of the unit it is part of. \"We're not releasing the name of the dog right now. The dog is still in theater. The dog, the canine, the military working dog, performed a tremendous service, as they all do in a variety of situations. Slightly wounded and fully recovering. But the dog is still in theater, returned to duty with its handlers,\" Milley said. A senior White House official told CBS News the administration is \"working on\" arrangements for the dog to visit the White House, but said it might be difficult since the canine is \"back at work\" in the field. Belgian Malinois are known for their work ethic and intelligence and are widely used by the military and law enforcement in the US and worldwide. A Malinois dog named Cairo famously accompanied US commandos on the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.",

    "articleText": "Abdullah Qardash, who reportedly bears the nicknames ‚Äúthe Destoyer‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Professor,‚Äù was reportedly already overseeing Daesh‚Äôs day-to-day operations and kill campaigns and has formally become its leader in the wake of Baghdadi‚Äôs death on Saturday, Newsweek reported, citing a regional intelligence official. Qardash was previously an officer of the Iraqi military during the reign of the late President Saddam Hussein. ‚ÄúBaghdadi was a figurehead. He was not involved in operations or day-to-day,‚Äù the official told Newsweek. ‚ÄúAll Baghdadi did was say yes or no ‚Äî no planning.‚Äù According to the Times of London, Qardash had been loyal to Baghdadi, as the pair were held in the Camp Bucca detention centre in Basra, Iraq, after being jailed by US forces over their links to al-Qaeda in 2003, and Baghdadi was even handing more power to Qardash before he died.

It‚Äôs about housing, it‚Äôs about dignity, it‚Äôs about education, health care, and that‚Äôs why the corporate media are just having a complete blackout on Latin America now.‚Äù https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/chile-uprising-30-years-of-neo-liberal-f On Monday, the protests in Chile entered their 11th day, and President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era announced new figures would be appointed to head key ministries following the termination of his entire cabinet on Saturday. Duarte, who just returned from reporting on the ground in Santiago, told Sputnik that while protesters were consciously rejecting 30 years of austerity, they were not so conscious of the greater legacy of political persecution they were challenging. In 1973, a CIA-orchestrated coup d‚Äôetat saw perhaps the archetypal neoliberal regime take power when Chilean General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, a socialist, instituting a 17-year reign of terror that saw tens of thousands of leftists and other dissidents tortured, murdered, or otherwise disappeared. While Pinochet was forced to cede power to a civilian government in 1990, his neoliberal policies never ended, destroying the country‚Äôs social services as well as organized labor. ‚ÄúWe cannot imagine the terror that people are feeling in some places, because we are talking about a dictatorship of the 21st century. I mean, I was in the same plaza where the government of Chile was torturing people. There is a political persecution against leaders of the student movement. I mean, it‚Äôs a real state of terror, what‚Äôs going on in Chile,‚Äù Duarte said. At least 20 people have been killed in the protests so far, and thousands have been arrested and assaulted. Reports have also surfaced of incidences where Chileans have been disappeared. Disturbing video of police in Chile dragging a woman into a civilian vehicle at night as she cries for help. Is this an arrest or a kidnapping?@hrw @hrw_espanol @UNHumanRights #ChileInCrisis #chileprotest #HumanRightsViolations #RenunciaPi√±era pic.twitter.com/oJZlDAzT5p ‚Äî Chile Woke Up (@ChileTrue) October 23, 2019 One popular video on Twitter drew explicit comparison between Pi√±era and Pinochet, highlighting how both men referred to the state‚Äôs struggles with protests as being ‚Äúat war.‚Äù ‚ÄúEstamos en Guerra‚Äù pic.twitter.com/sgY5T4Qmuo ‚Äî Gabriel Osorio (@ALeverkuhn83) October 21, 2019 ‚ÄúMost of the people that were in the streets were young people ‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt really have access to health care, education; everything was privatized during the last 30 years,‚Äù Duarte told hosts Eugene Puryear and Sean Blackmon. ‚ÄúThe main demand, or one of the main phrases that they are yelling all the time, is that it‚Äôs not only 30 pesos - that was the first excuse or the principal excuse to take the streets, the increases of the metro tariffs - it‚Äôs about 30 years. That‚Äôs what they are saying all the time.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really amazing to see that these young people are not afraid. I think it‚Äôs because of a lot of things. They didn‚Äôt experience in person the dictatorship of Pinochet; they are not really afraid. I do not think they are conscious about what a dictatorship is: we are talking about, as I said, torture, about disappearings, about violations - it‚Äôs really scary, what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt think they are are really conscious about what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù she said. Que lo sepa el mundo, el gobierno de @sebastianpinera est√° asesinando a su pueblo y tiene que ser juzgado por ello en la Corte Penal Internacional.#EstoPasaEnChile . pic.twitter.com/9fBWxvp2wJ ‚Äî Alina Duarte (@AlinaDuarte_) October 25, 2019 ‚ÄúThe second is because ‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt have anything, anything to lose. They are in the streets and, for example, there were signs saying that ‚Äòat this point, if the state shot me, they lose,‚Äô because the debts that the students have in all of Chile are amazing - they have debts like here in the US,‚Äù Duarte said. A Mexican citizen, Duarte told Sputnik that she, like so many others across Latin America, had been told ‚Äúmy whole life that if we accept the recommendation of the [IMF] and the World Bank, we would be someday like Chile.‚Äù Highlighting how decades of austerity in Chile had fueled the protests, she said, ‚ÄúNow, we are seeing what is being like Chile. So it‚Äôs really amazing what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù La sola idea de una Asamblea Constituyente en #Chile debe causar pavor entre las oligarqu√≠as latinoamericanas, iniciar√≠a un proceso imparable en la regi√≥n, como en 1999 con Venezuela, un nuevo pacto social que cambi√≥ la historia de todo el continente. pic.twitter.com/Ea73XxXEzy ‚Äî Alina Duarte (@AlinaDuarte_) October 26, 2019 ‚ÄúBecause of the same neoliberalism system, I might say that there are not big unions, big parties of the left who are ready to lead a new movement, a new national project,‚Äù the journalist said. ‚ÄúWhat we are seeing are people who are just saying, ‚ÄòThis needs to stop. Now.‚Äô‚Äù She noted that out of a population of 19 million, an estimated 1.2 million took to the streets in Santiago on Friday, in addition to the thousands that demonstrated in plazas across the country. She described how, despite the massive strikes by mass transit workers that paralyzed the city, people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really care‚Äù about the interruptions to their daily lives caused by the protests. Estamos viendo un hito en la historia contempor√°nea chilena, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era ha pedido perd√≥n, ha cedido en la disminuci√≥n de la jornada laboral (s√≠, la represi√≥n contin√∫a) y a√∫n as√≠ el pueblo sigue de pie. Ahora el gran reto ser√° canalizar la indignaci√≥n hacia la Constituyente. pic.twitter.com/huE3iRKxHZ ‚Äî Alina Duarte (@AlinaDuarte_) October 26, 2019 ¬°Atenci√≥n! ¬°M√°s frutos de la lucha del pueblo chileno! @sebastianpinera anuncia que solicit√≥ la renuncia de todo su gabinete (24 ministros), termina Estado de emergencia el domingo y disminuir√° costos en agua y TAG (dispositivo de pago en carreteras). ¬°Viva el pueblo de #Chile! pic.twitter.com/JJlmznKFRo ‚Äî Alina Duarte (@AlinaDuarte_) October 26, 2019 ‚ÄúIt is amazing how even when Sebastian Pi√±era has said he‚Äôs going to cancel the transportation tariffs, the increases of the metro tariffs, he said that he‚Äôs going to have a new cabinet. He asked for a pardon for his government, and his predecessors. He said that he was really sorry about it. And this is not enough for the people.‚Äù Following announcement of the concessions, on Sunday Pi√±era lifted the state of emergency that had been in place since shortly after the protests began. Duarte was also in Ecuador during the protests there the week before, and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs amazing how the indigenous movement are talking about the consequences of accepting these policies imposed. I mean, it‚Äôs not something new. We saw exactly the same policies in Latin America during the 80s and 90s. They used to call these ‚Äòprograms of structural adjustment‚Äô during the decades, and now they are just saying that we need to accept them, even if they don‚Äôt have a new name. This is not something new, and it‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor example, the best thing that can happen for Argentina was Chile. Can you imagine the people looking at their neighbor with the military in the streets, curfew, torture?‚Äù ‚ÄúSo also now, we are experiencing the same in all of the continent, and I think it‚Äôs a really good moment for the people in Latin America, because now here in the US, [US President Donald] Trump is really busy with other things, and we are just everywhere, taking the streets. It‚Äôs amazing how they are not saying exactly the same things in every country, but if we analyze the demands, they are talking about anti-systemic demands all over the continent.‚Äù The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "articleText": "Former Michigan Rep. John Conyers Jr., a liberal Democrat from what is now Detroit‚Äôs 13th Congressional District, has died at the age of 90. Conyers was first elected in 1964, becoming one of five African Americans in the House of Representatives. His overwhelmingly Democratic constituents reelected him 26 times over a period spanning 10 presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to Donald Trump. He passed Sunday at his home in Detroit. US President Donald Trump confirmed that Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has died. He was killed during a US military raid in northwest Syria on Saturday. Trump announced Sunday that al-Baghdadi died after running into a tunnel, where he detonated an explosive vest, killing himself and three of his children. \"'What Is the Fed Not Telling Us?': A number of financial experts and investors are very concerned over the Federal Reserve's recent infusion of cash into the market. They warn that the actions by the central bank could be the indication of a looming economic crisis,\" Common Dreams reported Sunday. \"On October 22, the Fed pumped $99.9 billion in temporary liquidity into the market to ease stresses brought on by a tightening credit market. Two days later, on October 24, the bank upped that to $134 billion.\" Should this be cause for concern about these repo market interventions? The European Union agreed Monday to delay Britain‚Äôs exit date from the bloc to January 31, once again postponing Brexit and potentially paving the way for a British general election beforehand. The postponement came in response to a request from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was forced to ask for more time after Parliament shot down his effort to speed the country out of the EU by the previous deadline of October 31.

    "description": "A 24-year-old Utah man was arrested Saturday and booked on suspicion of murdering his own mother with a revolver and broadcasting her final moments on social media.",
    "articleText": "Jeffrey Antonio Langford Jr. was taken to the Davis County Jail in North Salt Lake, Utah, on October 26 after he provided cops with conflicting stories concerning the death of Graciela Holker, his 45-year-old mother. According to Salt Lake City-based newspaper The Deseret News, officers were dispatched to Holker‚Äôs apartment at around 7:10 p.m. local time Saturday after Langford alerted police via social media, informing them that his mother had attempted to commit suicide and claiming his own death would follow shortly. Officers had also received calls alerting them of three separate Facebook Live videos that showed his mother‚Äôs body lying between the couch and coffee table. ‚ÄúThe male in the video states that he didn‚Äôt do this and she shot herself right in front of me,‚Äù the police affidavit read. ‚ÄúThe male keeps filming himself and says she‚Äôs not dead, I have to finish it.‚Äù While the final pull of the trigger was not broadcast on the stream, North Salt Lake police said Holker ‚Äúwould be unable to manipulate a firearm and fire another shot to her head.‚Äù The Davis County Jail booking affidavit revealed police also received a call from an individual who was conversing with Langford on Facebook and alleged the 24-year-old planned on committing suicide soon after his mother‚Äôs death. During a preliminary interview with police, Langford claimed that he did not touch the gun and that he had not done anything wrong. However, he later revealed he did in fact shoot his mother because he ‚Äúdid not want her to be in pain or be a vegetable.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn further investigation it was determined that there was sufficient probable cause to arrest the adult male and book him into jail on charges of homicide and obstruction of justice,‚Äù police told The Deseret News. ‚Äú[Langford] had a reddish brown substance on his face and clothing consistent in appearance to blood.‚Äù Officers also said that Langford ‚Äúexhibited signs of being intoxicated.‚Äù After investigating the scene, police were able to retrieve a six-shot revolver from Holker‚Äôs hand that was cocked and only had three bullets left in the barrel. Three casings were later found in Langford‚Äôs room - well removed from his mother‚Äôs body. He later told police that he removed the gun from his mother‚Äôs hand, unloaded the spent casings in his room, then reloaded it, according to the affidavit. The 24-year-old later told police that the revolver was cocked because he was planning to commit suicide (as he and his Facebook friend previously noted during the initial calls to police) and recorded the Facebook Live videos as ‚Äúa call for help.‚Äù ‚Äú[Langford] stated his mom did shoot herself in front of him. ... but she was still alive and in pain,‚Äù the affidavit said. ‚Äú[Langford] stated he did not want her to be in pain or be a vegetable, so he shot her once in the back of the head with the revolver while she was still alive.‚Äù Langford has been charged with first-degree murder and second-degree obstruction of justice - both of which are felonies. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of carrying a dangerous weapon while under the influence. A background check conducted by KTVX revealed Langford was previously arrested for drug possession.",

    "description": "An investigation into a private Facebook group including more than 18,000 current or former employees of the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found that group participants made violent and highly offensive comments regarding passengers and managers.",
    "articleText": "The investigation was carried out by NBC Washington. According to the group‚Äôs description, its purpose is to ‚Äúencourage dialogue and facilitate networking for current and former employees of the Transportation Security Administration.‚Äù In one post on the group's page, a TSA employee, who appears to work at the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, wrote, ‚ÄúF**king idiots of the world making my job harder. I hope your plane blows up.‚Äù In another post, a member of the group wrote, ‚ÄúHow the f**k do these passengers wake up and get themselves dressed in the morning and make it to the airport without getting themselves killed? Cause these people are pretty f**king stupid.‚Äù ‚ÄúOMG, I need to buy a Lotto ticket! We just screened a whole group of Chinese tourists without having to call a single bag check!‚Äù another user wrote. According to a spokesperson for the TSA, the agency does not monitor the page, and it is ‚Äúnot affiliated with TSA.‚Äù However, they added: ‚ÄúThe Code of Conduct for TSA employees provides that an employee‚Äôs off-duty internet use must not adversely reflect on TSA or negatively impact its mission, cause embarrassment to the agency, or cause the public and/or TSA to question the employee‚Äôs reliability, judgment, or trustworthiness.‚Äù Former TSA employee Monica Stoddard, who worked at Reagan National Airport in Washington, DC, for 11 years, said that there is a worker morale problem at the agency. ‚ÄúThe morale wasn‚Äôt a good one,‚Äù she told NBC Washington. ‚Äú[Workers] don‚Äôt have an outlet to say what‚Äôs going on and speak their minds.‚Äù According to a March 2019 audit by the US Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General, the TSA needs to ‚Äúcontinue to improve its retention, hiring, and training of Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).‚Äù Many former employees have complained about low pay and unclear job expectations. University of Maryland social media researcher Jen Golbeck told NBC that private social media pages are commonly used by public employees, and that while the pages initially start with ‚Äúgood intentions,‚Äù they ultimately tend to take a dark turn. ‚ÄúThen the slightly more extreme things start getting positive feedback. You can see that shift into really inappropriate spaces,‚Äù she said. The latest revelation comes months after two TSA employees at Florida‚Äôs Miami International Airport in July were placed on administrative leave after they were found responsible for an offensive display, which depicted two stuffed gorillas hanging from a noose.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The United States is considering a 12-month extension on tariff exclusions for $34 billion worth of Chinese imports as the tariff exclusion deadline is set to expire in December, the Office of the US Trade Representative said in a press release.",
    "articleText": "\"The United States Trade Representative (USTR) will commence on 1 November 2019 a process for considering extending for up to twelve months certain exclusions from additional tariffs on Chinese imports that were granted last December and are set to expire on December 28, 2019\", the release said on Monday. According to the release, once the notice is published in the Federal Register this week, the US Trade Representative will have a public commenting period from November 1-30. Liu, speaking in China last week in his first public comments on the trade talks since his meeting with Trump, stated that the two countries made \"concrete progress\" in many areas, laying an important foundation for the signing of a phased agreement, media reported. Liu has added that negotiations must be held on the basis of equal and mutual respect to address the two countries‚Äô core concerns. On 13 October, US President Donald Trump announced he had agreed in principle to a 'phase one' trade deal with China‚Äôs Vice Premier Liu He after high-level negotiations between the two sides in Washington. Trump has said the deal includes China agreeing to raise its US agricultural purchases to between $40 billion and $50 billion in addition to making reforms concerning intellectual property and financial services. The United States was also due to raise tariffs on Chinese exports from 25 percent to 30 percent on 15 October, but that planned increase appears to be on hold as well. Washington and Beijing have been waging a tariff war since last year. The US has blamed China for creating a trade imbalance and imposed additional tariffs on a vast list of Chinese products, while Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs on US goods. The escalating tensions gravely affected international trade, slowing down the global growth for up to 0.6%. After several rounds of talks, the sides came close to striking a trade deal in May, but failed, leading to another series of trade restrictions.",

Earlier on Monday, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera replaced key ministers, including the interior and finance ministers, amid mass protests in the country. A state of emergency was announced by Pinera on 18 October, when protests against planned subway fare increases turned violent, with demonstrators setting fire to subway stations and buses. The state of emergency ended at midnight on 27 October.

    "description": "US internet giant Google has been accused of anti-Brexit bias by British Conservative Party MP‚Äôs. And with Brexit still being far from done - the EU leaders announced they will grant a Brexit extension until 31 January 2020 following UK Parliament‚Äôs request - the Tory‚Äôs don‚Äôt want Google to be setting the agenda.",
    "articleText": "A recent study revealed that users searching for information on Brexit using the Google search engine have a higher chance of coming across pro-EU news articles on the first page of Google. Search engine optimisation platform Searchmetrics analysis of Brexit-related searches on Google has shown that websites such as BBC and the Guardian with predominantly pro-Remain content come out on top. The study was carried out in October and data collected has shown that BBC accounts for around 30% of the Brexit search market, while the Guardian for over 12%. \"Google is a private company. How they create search algorithms is their choice. But only to a certain extent,\" argues Christopher Oldcorn, an investigative journalist, covering politics, social policy and international affairs. He says Google should remain neutral and not be pushing a political agenda. \"Google‚Äôs behaviour is similar to insider trading. They are pushing one-side of a political issue. Individuals inside Google could be \"betting\" on one side winning and profiting from shifting people‚Äôs beliefs,‚Äù Oldcorn said. The analysis also revealed that websites that in general are considered pro-Brexit, such as the Daily Telegraph, the Express and the Sun account for only between 2% to 4% of the Brexit search market. Oldcorn says that this is very worrying information: \"What is most concerning about this study is the number one UK news website received only 2-4% of results? The Sun is number one based on total digital traffic. The latest verified news website statistics put the Sun with 32.8 million unique users. But the Sun only received between 2-4% of total results? One does not need a statistics degree to figure out something is wrong,\" the investigative journalist stressed. \"Google needs to stop trying to influence people‚Äôs beliefs by using its search results,\" Oldcorn noted. According to Dr Binoy Kampmark, a senior lecturer at RMIT University in Melbourne and a global research journalist Google‚Äôs operating algorithms tend to favour the more popular news and information, so ideas of bias can be part of it. \"On some level, this is right, in so far as the bias favours the proportion of searches and interest present in the search engine. But Google's first priority is to provide the means to seek accessible results. Both conservatives and those of the left have accused it of biases against them at various points. It is unsurprising, therefore, to see this unfold in the Brexit debate, if for no reason that it is so contentious,\" Dr Kampmark said.

    "description": "A vote on whether to hold a general election on the 12th of December has been held in the British parliament, as the UK looks to end its ongoing political deadlock. Dr Connal Parr, Lecturer in History at Northumbria University, expressed his views on the matter.",
    "articleText": "Sputnik: Would a general election be a good thing for the Labour Party? Dr Connal Parr: Corbyn is aware of the fact that if the election comes on the 12th; then what can happen is that it can be fought on the basis that the Conservative‚Äôs trump card was that they were going to get Brexit done, but another extension to Article Fifty has been agreed this morning amongst EU members to the 31st of January 2020, so Corbyn could perhaps see this as something he can get some mileage out of. Sputnik: Should Corbyn resign if Labour suffered a bad result in a general election? Dr Connal Parr: If you‚Äôd asked me that question about potential successors to Corbyn about a year ago; a kind of person who would command respect in a parliamentary sense would be Keir Stamer, but it seems for me that the person who has emerged as a serious contender, who had previously stood don‚Äôt forget against Gordon Brown in 2007, is John McDonnell. This would be quite difficult for a lot of people, because McDonnell has a very serious backbench left-wing profile over the years, but it strikes me that he‚Äôs worked very hard to hone a certain media image in recent times, and he seems to have won over a lot of people who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have thought he was a contender. It would probably be between McDonnell, Stamer and I imagine a female candidate of some kind, probably someone like Diane Abbott, but I do think it would be between those two men. Sputnik: Will Brexit finally be delivered in 2020? Dr Connal Parr: I think that we are now leaving in January 2020, and again it was always going to be complicated like this, it was always going to be very difficult and convoluted for us, so it‚Äôs understandable that it‚Äôs gone in this direction. The reason why that‚Äôs happened is that the UK parliament has averted a no-deal scenario, which would have happened this Thursday, so having avoided that; they have to find out some workable exit, which is still allowing people to deliver on the democratic result of June 2016. In many ways it will be important to a lot of people both in the Labour Party and Conservatives that some form of Brexit is delivered, and if the UK decides that it‚Äôs not a good situation; perhaps in the future the UK could rethink its relationship and possibly someway down the line consider a way back in, it‚Äôs just a case of trying something different.

    "articleText": "The US Department of Defense says the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) system contract will help the US government store and process classified data, allowing the armed forces to use artificial intelligence to enhance their planning and fighting capabilities. The contract has a base period of two years and a $1 million guarantee. The Department of Defense emphasized in an announcement that the process was fair and followed procurement guidelines. It noted that over the past two years, it has awarded more than $11 billion in 10 separate cloud-computing contracts, and said the JEDI award \"continues our strategy of a multi-vendor, multi-cloud environment.\" The announcement came as a surprise, as Amazon was believed to be the most likely candidate. Oracle and IBM were also potential contractors but were earlier eliminated from the process. Oracle filed a lawsuit in December, calling the process unfair and illegal. Last week, Microsoft, the second-largest publicly traded US company, announced first-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates. The company said revenue from its cloud-computing business soared 36% year-over-year to a record $11.6 billion. The tech giant‚Äôs market capitalization reached $1.099 trillion, which trails only Apple ($1.12 trillion).",

    "description": "Seventy percent of millennials say they are somewhat or extremely likely to vote for a socialist candidate, according to a new poll conducted by the YouGov‚ÄìVictims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a US nonprofit educational organization that aims to ‚Äútell the truth about communism.‚Äù",
    "articleText": "The poll results, which were released Monday, found that 50% of millennials and 51% of Generation Z members view capitalism somewhat or very unfavorably, which revealed an increase of 6 and 8 percentage points, respectively, from last year‚Äôs poll. Millennials are between the ages of 23 and 38, while those identified as Generation Z are between the ages of 16 and 22. Meanwhile, 44%, 22% and 33% of Generation X (40-54), baby boomers (55-75) and the silent generation (76-94), respectively, said they were somewhat or extremely likely to vote for a socialist candidate. The results also revealed that 53% of Americans would ‚Äúnever‚Äù or would be ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù to vote for a candidate who identifies as a ‚Äúdemocratic socialist,‚Äù compared to 47% who voted as such in 2018. Democratic socialists believe in a political democracy and a socially-owned economy. Fifty-seven percent of millennials polled said they believe the US Declaration of Independence ‚Äúbetter guarantees freedom and inequality over the Communist Manifesto,‚Äù according to the Hill. The Communist Manifesto, which was published in 1948 by German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, discusses the conflicts of capitalism. Additionally, roughly 94% of America‚Äôs polled silent generation indicated that the Declaration of Independence better protects freedom than the Communist Manifesto. However, capitalism, an economic and political system in which the country‚Äôs industry is owned by private owners instead of the state, is still viewed more favorably than socialism, with 61% of those polled having a favorable view of the system. Marion Smith, executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, said the poll‚Äôs results represent ‚Äúhistorical amnesia.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe historical amnesia about the dangers of communism and socialism is on full display in this year‚Äôs report,‚Äù Smith said in a Monday statement obtained by Market Watch. ‚ÄúWhen we don‚Äôt educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas.‚Äù Other social media users commenting on the poll‚Äôs results interpreted the findings as millennials' desire for affordable healthcare, housing and education as opposed to a preference for a communist state. The poll results could impact how US voters view US 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist known for his Medicare for All plan, which would provide comprehensive healthcare to all Americans without any out-of-pocket expenses. The poll surveyed 2,100 US participants over the age of 16 and had a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points. A similar poll conducted by Gallup in May found that 43% of US adults believe socialism is good, which represents a sharp increase from a 1942 Roper/Fortune survey that found that 25% of Americans view socialism as good.",

    "description": "GENEVA (Sputnik) - Russia is hoping that Kurdish militants in Syria will be able to withdraw its forces from the border zone with Turkey on time, Russian special envoy for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev said on Monday.",
    "articleText": "\"Let's hope, we'll see. I wouldn't say that there are no guarantees [that they will not have time to withdraw their forces within the 150-hour period stipulated by the memorandum]. An agreement has been reached between our presidents, which means that both presidents gave certain guarantees. Let's wait and see\", Lavrentyev told reporters in Geneva. Lavrentyev also commented on the US plans to protect the oil fields in northeastern Syria, saying that the area must be under control of the Syrian government. Earlier in the day, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said that Washington would not allow the Russian and Syrian forces access to the oil fields, ensuring instead that the Kurds will take control over the areas. The deadline for the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the 30-kilometer border zone in northeastern Syria, stipulated by the Russian-Turkish memorandum, expires at 6.00 pm Moscow time (15:00 GMT) on Tuesday, 28 October. Russia's president Vladimir Putin and his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan negotiated the agreement on 22 October during their meeting at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. The motion comes amid Turkish Operation Peace Spring in northeastern Syria, launched on 9 October to establish a ''safe-zone'' and secure its border from the Kurdish militants and terrorists.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The US troops will deny Russian and Syrian forces access to oil fields it is protecting in northeast Syria, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said during a briefing at the Pentagon on Monday.",
    "articleText": "\"Short answer is yes, it presently does, because in that case we want to make sure SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] does have access to the resources in order to guard the prisons, in order to arm their own troops, in order to assist us with the defeat Daesh* mission\", Esper said when asked if US forces will deny Russian and Syrian forces access to the oil fields. Esper has pointed out that the US forces in Syria will continue to counter Daesh* operations with its partners and further maintain its existing mission to protect oil fields there from the terrorist group. Earlier at the press conference, he claimed that US forces in Syria would continue to counter Daesh* operations with its partners and further maintain its existing mission to protect oil fields there from the terror group. Russian officials have said the United States is involved in state banditry by utilizing Syrian oil. Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Saturday that the United States is part of smuggling oil operations in northeastern Syria. Previously, Esper said that the United States intended to take measures in the near future to strengthen its position in Deir Ez-Zor to prevent terrorists from accessing the oil fields. According to the US defence secretary, the United States is studying how to move forces in the region so as to ensure the safety of the oil fields. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump proposed letting the Kurdish forces some oil-rich regions in the north of Syria. On Wednesday, Iraqi Defence Minister Najah Shammari stated the US forces, which the United States withdrew from northern Syria earlier, would remain in Iraq no longer than four weeks. The statements come after Donald Trump stated that the US forces killed Baghdadi in the Syrian city of Idlib and thanked Russia, Iraq, Syria and Turkey for the relevant help. According to Donald Trump, Russia, in particular, \"treated [the US military] great\" and opened the Syrian airspace under its control for the US helicopters to find Baghdadi. The Russian Defence Ministry has pointed out that it had not obtained any reliable data about the US operation and had reasons to question the realness of it. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist group banned in Russia",

    "articleText": "While US President Donald Trump was receiving boos from the crowd during Sunday night‚Äôs game in Nationals Park between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros, three women caught the nation‚Äôs attention by flashing their boobs in the name of breast cancer awareness. The trio of flashers, later identified as Julia Rose, Lauren Summer and Kayla Lauren, provided Houston Astros pitcher Gerrit Cole and live Major League Baseball (MLB) viewers with quite an eyeful once they lifted their shirts up at the bottom of the seventh inning. According to a Twitter post from Summer and several interviews following the flash, the women chose to free their nipples in conjunction with the US‚Äô National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. However, it appeared the women‚Äôs stunt received a swift response from the MLB. Rose, who is the founder of adult digital magazine SHAGMAG, revealed that she, along with her friends, were not only banned from all future MLB games, but also ‚Äúall Major League Baseball stadiums and facilities, indefinitely.‚Äù Shit. pic.twitter.com/8YepMP4eA1 ‚Äî Julia Rose (@JuliaRose_33) October 28, 2019 ‚ÄúOn October 27, 2019, you attended World Series Game 5 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.,‚Äù David Thomas, MLB vice president of security and ballpark operation, allegedly wrote. ‚ÄúDuring the game, you violated the fan code of conduct by exposing yourself during the seventh inning in order to promote a business. You were also part of a scheme in which you induced others to expose themselves to promote the business. You are hereby banned from all Major League Baseball stadiums and facilities, indefinitely.‚Äù The ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù referenced in the letter apparently relates to SHAGMAG, despite the business‚Äô name being hidden once the women‚Äôs matching shirts went up Sunday night. While Rose‚Äôs Twitter posting of the letter has amassed well over 100,000 likes and nearly 14,000 retweets, it would appear not everyone is buying the expedited delivery of the ban. Stadiums ban specific people, the @mlb does not. In addition, violators are required to sign a paper acknowledging the ban and that attendance at that park will result in trespassing.

At least I know who not to do business with,‚Äù she said Thursday evening in her post. \"He‚Äôs getting a little carried away with it, especially when he had Obama‚Äôs head hanging on a noose,\" Robert Feeney, a resident who lives across from Quality Coatings, told the Detroit Free Press. Though the majority of the outrage centered around the sight of the coiled rope alluding to a lynching of the former president, the full display shows Trump also standing on the severed head of his 2016 presidential race opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúThis is disgusting. Certainly not representative of the majority of people in Fowlerville,‚Äù Mary Vielbig said in the comment section of DeTroyer‚Äôs post. ‚ÄúMy family has done lots of business here in the past. Those days are done!‚Äù However, not everyone is against the auto shop owner. Renee Koch, another woman from the area, denounced the display as ‚Äúdumb,‚Äù but also suggested those in the community ‚Äúbe bigger than this and just say that wasn't a great idea and move on.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm guilty of using this POS platform myself where words I write can damage and hurt. Done with it,‚Äù she said before doubling back to say, ‚Äúremember karma can be a real b***h.‚Äù The Free Press noted that Huff had revamped his display by Friday and completely removed Obama‚Äôs head from the display. Rather than standing on Clinton‚Äôs head, Trump is now depicted with a headband and sash that read ‚ÄúPC POLICE.‚Äù \"It was a Halloween decoration that I guess went too far,\" he said to the outlet on Sunday. Despite the overwhelming amount of Trump-themed pumpkins - one of which proudly said ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù - Huff admitted he is not an active voter, nor did he vote in the 2016 presidential election. \"I don‚Äôt support anyone. I‚Äôve never voted for anyone other than myself,‚Äù Huff argued, saying he did not favor one candidate over the other. The change in decor and owner‚Äôs ‚Äúapology,‚Äù however, did little to change DeTroyer‚Äôs mind. In fact, the resident argued the updated version of the display reveals the intent behind the initial decoration. ‚ÄúYes he apologized for offending people and Halloween is supposed to be scary. Then if it was about Halloween then why put PC police on it?‚Äù she asked under her original post, to which Kevin Copeland responded, saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs given the middle finger to the town twice now.‚Äù",

    "description": "House Democrats have announced they will vote on Thursday to formalize procedures for the next phase of their impeachment inquiry into US President Donald Trump.",
    "articleText": "House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-MA) said in a Monday statement the committee was readying a resolution for Thursday that will \"ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward\" for the impeachment inquiry headed by the US House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) elaborated in a statement of her own shortly thereafter, saying, \"This week, we will bring a resolution to the floor that affirms the ongoing, existing investigation that is currently being conducted by our committees as part of this impeachment inquiry, including all requests for documents, subpoenas for records and testimony, and any other investigative steps previously taken or to be taken as part of this investigation.\" \"This resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel,\" Pelosi's statement continues. \"We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives. Nobody is above the law.\" The move comes just hours after Deputy National Security Adviser Charles Kupperman refused to appear before the trio of House committees carrying out the impeachment inquiry to give a deposition. Kupperman filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking guidance from a federal judge following the House's subpoena, which the White House had previously directed officials not to obey. Having not received an answer, the adviser declined to appear, as he noted in the lawsuit he ‚Äúcannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches.‚Äù \"We are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts,\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Monday after Kupperman failed to appear. \"We expect that the court will make short shrift of that argument, but nonetheless, we move forward.\" On October 15, Pelosi and Schiff said in a joint press conference that despite the Trump administration's claim that the House impeachment inquiry lacked legitimacy and legality until put to a vote in the whole 435-person legislative chamber, ‚Äúthere is no requirement that we have a vote and so at this time we will not be having a vote.\" On Monday evening, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) claimed victory in light of the news about the House vote, saying his own resolution condemning Democrats' actions \"forced their hand.\" \"The American people have been outraged by the unfair nature and lack of due process House Democrats have given to President Trump,\" Graham said in the statement. \"I take pride in the fact that our vigorous response to their underhanded tactics ended up making the House Democrat position untenable. Today, they were forced to change course.\" \"Finally, I look forward to reviewing their proposal and ensuring it provides President Trump with the rights and privileges Republicans afforded former President [Bill] Clinton during the 1998 impeachment process.\" The subject of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the circumstances under which Trump pressed Zelenskyy to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden's actions vis-a-vis Ukraine in 2016.",

    "title": "'Piece of Propaganda Sh*t': Gamers Crash Call of Duty MW's Rating Over Anti-Russian Sentiments",
    "description": "After having already faced a scandal in Russia once due to a controversial level where civilians are mass-murdered in an unnamed Russian airport, the developers of the new Call of Duty game seem to have ended up in an even bigger scandal this time.",
    "articleText": "User ratings for the recently released instalment in the popular videogame series Call of Duty Modern Warfare have dropped from around 7 points to 2.5 out of 10 on PC, based on reviews on the website Metacritic, while the verdicts of professional critics mostly float between 80 and 90 out of 100. The majority of the around 3,100 negative user reviews on all of three platforms are centred on an \"issue\" that has infuriated gamers ‚Äì the depiction of Russians in the game. The plot is mostly set in the fictional state of Urzikstan, which resembles Syria, that is occupied by Russian forces fighting against terrorist groups. The main characters are trying to hunt down a shipment of Russian chemical weapons, which was hijacked on its way to Urzikstan, and take down a Russian general named Barkov who commands the troops in the country. Morally Grey Warfare? The creators of the latest instalment of the Call of Duty (CoD) series promised prior to the its release that it would fulfil one of the most popular player demands ‚Äì \"morally grey characters\" who are neither outright \"evil\" nor \"good\". But according to the user responses on Metacritic, this is exactly what Modern Warfare failed to deliver. Initial signs of this emerged after Activision, the game‚Äôs publisher, released one of the first trailers. In the video, people dressed like members of the Syrian White Helmets group are seen rescuing civilians trapped under the debris of a building that collapsed after being bombed by what looks like a Sukhoi jet. However, in real life, Russia considers the White Helmets to be a group affiliated with terrorists and that films staged videos of false-flag attacks on civilians in Syria. ¬© YouTube screenshot White Helmets appear in the trailer for \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" In the game itself, US and British forces, as well as local \"rebels\", do carry out \"morally grey\" actions as the story unfolds. But, Russian troops are still shown committing atrocities like executing and bombing civilians, although in the end Moscow denounces the rogue actions of General Barkov, who led the soldiers. At the same time, American and British forces are shown in the game as saviours, according to most gamers. Outrage Among Russian Gamers In a bid to mitigate the possible backlash from Russian players, the developers made certain changes to the version of the game that was distributed in the country. Namely, they repainted the White Helmets as green ones and removed the majority of lines associating the \"evil\" soldiers with the Russian Army, calling them \"Barkov's men\", in an obvious, albeit unsuccessful, move to avoid associating them with Moscow. Still, even those who played the amended Russian version wound up outraged by the depiction of Russia‚Äôs forces in the game. \"Thanks Activision for poured **** on my country, you are hypocrites and Nazis\", a user under the handle \"Lyrkov\" wrote on Metacritic. \"I'm already tired of the evil Russians. You said that everything will be gray but I see angels of Americans and Russian devils\", another used, called \"Egorka\", added. Many Russian netizens slammed the game as outright propaganda coming in line with a trend established by many Western politicians and media outlets several years ago. \"It's just Joke! Not a Game! This is an incredibly propaganda *****\", a user under the handle \"AgentUSSR\" wrote. \"Disgusting game! Taste of Goebbels propoganda. I wouldn't buy any game from them\", the user \"Mastacrusta\" opined. One of Russia's most famous streamers, Ilya Maddison, decided to stop playing the game mid-stream just hours after starting it. \"You must be a total freak to play this blatantly criminal game, which openly says that the [Russian] army ‚Äì are terrorists\", he wrote on his Twitter. Backlash From Gamers Outside Russia Players in Russia were notably not the only ones who were outraged by the game's depiction of Russians. \"The problem here is not that the Chinese / Russians / Latinos etc. are placed hostile to the main character. They are shown as absolute moral freaks. I'm not Russian, but I fully support the hatred and boycott of the game\", a reviewer from Ukraine with the username \"Olexandr\" wrote. Some users, however, managed to find something positive in the game's apparent \"Russophobia\". \"I would like to point out what is actually GOOD about this game. Well, it is GOOD the portrayal of the Russians is so blatant and flat-out: because it could've been subtler, the propaganda could've been smarter [‚Ä¶] it could've been more inventive and therefore believable. But, luckily for us all, the writers of the game suffer from the same case of terminal creative impotence [‚Ä¶] Because of this, any person with half a brain in the head will certainly view it as propaganda aimed at dehumanizing the Russians\", a user with the handle \"LHOOQ\" pointed out. Trying to Rewrite History? A separate source of outrage among players around the world was an episode in the game where one of the characters describes how Russian forces were bombarding \"innocent civilians\" fleeing the war at a location called \"The Highway of Death\". However, the term \"Highway of Death\" usually refers to a February 1991 bombardment of a highway between Kuwait and Iraq, where US, Canadian, British, and French aircraft bombed the fleeing Iraqi Army and, according to some accounts, also Kuwaiti hostages and civilian refugees who were fleeing with them. The controversial attack, which claimed the lives of between 200 and 1,000 people, has been regarded as a disproportionate use of force, or even a \"war crime\", by some. ¬© Photo: YouTube/ Call of Duty Official Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ ‚Äì Story Trailer Users on Metacritic suggested that the developers of the game went so far in their \"propaganda\" efforts that they decided to shift the blame for the \"Highway of Death\" incident onto the Russians too, despite the US and other Western states being responsible for the actual events. \"Activision is rewriting and justifying AMERICAN WAR CRIMES in Iraq by setting Russia guilty for the attack on the Highway of Death which was done IRL by the US Airforce slaughtering refugees, civilians, women and children\", a user called \"zedeltus\" opined. \"Just one statement. Maybe when you talked about fictitious road of death bombed by Russians in your game you meant REAL HIGHWAY OF DEATH IN IRAQ bombed by US. I am confused, y know... They still say it is not propaganda\", another user under the handle \"Zooropa\" wrote. Call of Duty's Woes in Russia Despite the controversial campaign, the new Modern Warfare was still greenlit for sale in Russia on all platforms except PlayStation 4, with Sony deciding that it would not be distributing the game on Russia's territory. This is not the first time that the Call of Duty series has faced trouble in Russia. In Modern Warfare 2, which was released in 2009, there was a notorious level called \"No Russian\", where the main character participated in a mass shooting of civilians in an unnamed Russian airport. The level was cut out of the Russian version of the game following threats to ban it for extremism, while in international versions players were given an option to skip the part. According to the game's plot, the massacre was carried out by a fictional Russian terrorist group pretending to be Americans in a bid to provoke Moscow to start war against the US. The author of the mission insisted that it was important to the plot and the player's understanding that the terrorist leader, Makarov, was an evil character.",

    "description": "As a political commentator and ex-adviser to Bill Clinton put it earlier, there is ‚Äúalways a possibility‚Äù that Hillary, who is currently touring the country to promote her book on ‚Äúgutsy women‚Äù, will enter the fray - even at the last minute.",
    "articleText": "Former adviser to President Clinton, Dick Morris, told John Catsimatidis on his radio show on Sunday that Hillary Clinton most likely wants to dive into the 2020 presidential race because she thinks ‚ÄúGod put her on the Earth‚Äù for the presidency. ‚ÄúMy feeling is that she wants to‚Äù, Morris said, further elaborating on how spiritually bound she might be feeling: ‚ÄúShe feels entitled to do it. She feels compelled to do it. She feels that God put her on the Earth to do it‚Äù. However, he pinpointed there was one obstacle in her way: ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs hesitant because she realises the timing is bad‚Äù, Morris noted, going on specify what the arguably more favourable conditions for Clinton to jump into the race would be. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got to wait until Biden drops out because he‚Äôs obviously next in line for it, and if he goes away, there‚Äôs an opening for her‚Äù, Morris said. According to Bill Clinton‚Äôs former adviser, who first spoke about the possibility last Sunday on the same programme, Hillary would suit the role of the moderate candidate instead of Biden, as voters would be seeking an alternative to the ‚Äúleftist‚Äù Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ‚ÄúThe question is, are there enough moderates to beat Elizabeth Warren the leftist?‚Äù Morris wondered, expressing his personal certainty that Clinton is waiting for favourable circumstances to once again throw the gauntlet to President Trump and her fellow Dems: ‚ÄúMake no mistake. She wants it‚Äù, he added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs planning on it. She‚Äôll do everything she can to achieve it‚Äù.

Some of her allies have dismissed the rumours, saying they're ‚ÄúBannon-created‚Äù, referring to right-wing activist and media personality Stephen Bannon, a former adviser to President Trump. Clinton‚Äôs recent remarks on PBS NewsHour propelled the speculation, as the former secretary of state told the outlet that she could ‚Äúobviously‚Äù beat Trump ‚Äúagain‚Äù. Trump, for his part, also chimed in on the debate, suggesting in a recent tweet that ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary‚Äù should join the race ‚Äúto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren‚Äù provided she explains ‚Äúall of her high crimes and misdemeanours including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‚ÄòC‚Äô Subpoena!‚Äù",

    "articleText": "British MPs have voted to reject a General Election on 12 December in the crucial vote. A total of 299 MPs voted in support of PM proposal, with 70 voted against. However, Johnson has failed to secure the backing of the two-thirds of the 650 MPs required by law to pass the motion. The vote in Parliament, under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, came just hours after EU leaders agreed in principle to extend Brexit until 31 January, meaning Britain will not leave the bloc on Thursday, 31 October, as the Prime Minister had always maintained. EU Council President Donald Tusk described it as a \"flextension\" - meaning Britain could still leave on 31 October if the UK and EU Parliaments vote in favour of a deal in time.

The program began in 2016 and found that planes like the Wolverine and Super Tucano provide all-around better mission performance than the Air Force‚Äôs A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support aircraft, which is nearing retirement and was designed to knock out Soviet tank formations if the Cold War in Europe ever got hot. Another plane tested in the program was the Swiss-made Pilatus PC-12NG. The irony is that the A-10‚Äôs robust design grew out of the Air Force‚Äôs embarrassing shortage of ground attack aircraft during the Vietnam War, when it was forced to use A-1 Skyraiders for the role - another turboprop plane that first flew in the final days of World War II. Beechcraft, a spinoff of Raytheon that was eventually bought by Textron, has been producing the T-6 Texan II since 2001, mostly as a training aircraft for a variety of countries around the world, with the AT-6 Wolverine combat version only recently entering consideration for use via the US Air Force. Brazilian maker Embreier has been producing the A-29 since 2003, and the plane has found wide use among Third World air forces from Central America to equatorial Africa. The US has also overseen the Super Tucano‚Äôs incorporation into the burgeoning Afghan Air Force, which in a remarkable incidence of disparate technologies, is still able to deploy laser-guided munitions from the propeller-driven planes in its fight against the Taliban. There‚Äôs not a world of difference between the T-29 and AT-6, either. Both aircraft use essentially the same Pratt & Whitney engine and have nearly the same maximum ferry range; however, the Wolverine has a higher maximum speed and heavier maximum lifting weight. Both planes featured side-by-side in a recent listicle of the top 10 light attack aircraft by Airforce-Technology, incidentally the only two prop-driven planes on the list.",

    "description": "A massive white shark was located on Saturday in the Florida Keys by Ocearch, an organization that helps scientists collect oceanographic data.",
    "articleText": "The data shows that the creature, dubbed Unama'ki, made the 2,000 mile trek from the south of Nova Scotia in Canada - where scientists tagged it with a tracker in September - all the way down the US East Coast to Florida over the past couple of months. The name Unama'ki means ‚Äúland of the fog‚Äù in the Mi‚Äôkmaq language spoken by the indigeous Mi‚Äôkmaq people of Nova Scotia and refers to the Canadian province. ‚Äî OCEARCH (@OCEARCH) September 30, 2019 The shark, which weights 2,076 pounds and is 15 feet and 5 inches long, pinged in several locations across the East Coast, including Atlantic City in New Jersey and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, before making its way to the Florida Keys, a string of islands between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. \"As a big mature female, Unama'ki has the potential to lead us to the site where she gives birth and exposes a new white shark nursery,\" Ocearch is quoted as saying by Newsweek. According to Ocearch's website, when a tagged shark‚Äôs fin breaks through the water‚Äôs surface, the tracker attached to the shark sends a signal to a satellite orbiting the Earth, which then transmits the animal‚Äôs estimated location back to the organization. Ocearch has been tracking great whites for years to determine where they breed in the Atlantic region. The organization‚Äôs research has found that great whites typically migrate to Florida, the Carolinas and Georgia during the winter months. Researchers also suspect that there are two groups of white sharks in the Atlantic that congregate in either Massachusetts or Canada during the late summer and early fall months. \"So in the study of the white shark in the northwest Atlantic, we're tracking these big animals all the way from Atlantic Canada to all the way down in the Florida peninsula,\" Robert Hunter, Ocearch's chief science advisor, is quoted as saying by Newsweek. \"Something fascinating that we've noticed is that there are some animals that go to the Cape Cod area in the summertime to feed. And then there are others, that have bypassed cape cod and come up Nova Scotia to feed. So right now we are looking at the possibility of two distinct groups or subpopulations of white sharks in the northwest Atlantic,‚Äù he added.",

    "description": "The images etched into the dike tunnel cover a range of topics - from war equipment to birds, with the meaning of most of them yet to be determined.",
    "articleText": "On the steep sides of the 8.4-metre-long tunnel in Ecatepec, right outside Mexico City, there have been found a series of images, including petroglyphs and stucco relief panels dating back to as early as colonial times, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) said in a statement cited by the Mexico News Daily. 11 of the newly found carvings are diverse in terms of their topic, featuring everything from a war shield and the head of a carnivorous bird to a ‚Äúpaper ornament‚Äù. Another image, a teocalli, or temple, is visible on the central stone of the arch entrance, with the temple believed by researchers to be dedicated to the rain god Tl√°loc. The nature and meaning of most of the images are currently being studied. Raul Garcia, coordinator of a project to preserve the archaeological treasures of the dike system, which the tunnel is part of, brought up one of the assumptions that the images could have been made by indigenous people in Ecatepec, now a populous municipality, and Chiconautla, in pre-Hispanic times. Residents of both towns worked on the construction of the dike, he added. Per INAH Director Antonio Huitron, the dike, commonly known today as the Albarradon de Ecatepec, was declared a historic site several years ago and will soon be included into a public park so that people will be able to see the ‚Äúcultural heritage to which they are heirs‚Äù. The tunnel with the pre-Hispanic carvings will also be open to the public, but the original stones will be replaced with replicas, Huitron detailed.",

    "description": "On 23rd October, The Courage Foundation released the landmark findings of its investigation into the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons‚Äô (OPCW) suppression of vital evidence in its investigation of the alleged 7th April 2018 chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria.",
    "articleText": "The Foundation‚Äôs expert panel met with a member of the OPCW‚Äôs Douma fact-finding mission, who provided the an ‚Äúextensive presentation, including internal emails, text exchanges and suppressed draft reports‚Äù ‚Äì in its resultant report, the team were unanimous in expressing alarm ‚Äúover unacceptable practices in the investigation of the alleged chemical attack in Douma‚Äù, and concluded each of the key evidentiary pillars of the investigation (including chemical analysis, toxicology, ballistics and witness testimonies) were flawed and bear little relation to the facts‚Äù. Here's British journalist Jonathan Steele on the BBC saying he was in attendance at the OPCW/Douma panel and witnessed a new OPCW whistleblower say his findings were suppressed on the absence of evidence for chlorine gas use on the scene in Syria. pic.twitter.com/JRdGAEnlVf ‚Äî Caitlin Johnstone ‚è≥ (@caitoz) October 27, 2019 ‚ÄúWe became convinced key information about chemical analyses, toxicology consultations, ballistics studies, and witness testimonies was suppressed, ostensibly to favour a preordained conclusion. We‚Äôve learned of disquieting efforts to exclude some inspectors from the investigation whilst thwarting their attempts to raise legitimate concerns, highlight irregular practices or even to express their differing observations and assessments ‚Äîa right explicitly conferred on inspectors in the Chemical Weapons Convention, evidently with the intention of ensuring the independence and authoritativeness of inspection reports,‚Äù the panel said in an official statement. The bombshell findings went entirely unreported in the mainstream media, however ‚Äì until award-winning veteran journalist Jonathan Steele managed to slip a reference past the BBC censors five days later. Steele was invited onto the World Service‚Äôs Weekend programme to discuss the elimination of Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ‚Äì but partway through, he made a startling intervention, noting he‚Äôd attended the briefing given to the Foundation by the OPCW whistleblower, one of the inspectors sent to Douma in April 2018 ‚Äúto check into the allegations by the rebels that Syrian aeroplanes had dropped two canisters of chlorine gas, killing up to 43 people‚Äù, who ‚Äúclaims he was in charge of picking up the samples in the affected areas, and in neutral areas, to check whether there were chlorine derivatives there‚Äù. Amazingly, host Paul Henley didn‚Äôt change the subject or terminate the conversation, instead asking Steele for more information. ‚Äú[The investigator] found there was no difference. So it rather suggested there was no chemical gas attack, because in the buildings where the people allegedly died there was no extra chlorinated organic chemicals than in the normal streets elsewhere. And I put this to the OPCW for comment, and they haven‚Äôt yet replied. But it rather suggests a lot of this was propaganda,‚Äù Steele said. ‚ÄúPropaganda led by?‚Äù Henley probed. ‚ÄúBy the rebel side to try and bring in American planes, which did happen. American, British and French planes bombed Damascus a few days after these reports. This is the second whistleblower to come forward. A few months ago there was a leaked report by the person who looked into the ballistics, as to whether these cylinders had been dropped by planes, looking at the damage of the building and the damage on the side of the cylinders. And he concluded the higher probability was these cylinders were placed on the ground, rather than from planes,‚Äù Steele explained. ‚ÄúThis would be a major revelation‚Ä¶Given the number of people rubbishing the idea these could have been fake videos at the time,‚Äù Henley noted. ‚ÄúWell, these two scientists, I think they‚Äôre non-political ‚Äî they wouldn‚Äôt have been sent to Douma if they‚Äôd had strong political views by the OPCW. They want to speak to the Conference of the Member States in November, next month, and give their views, and be allowed to come forward publicly with their concerns. Because they‚Äôve tried to raise them internally and been ‚Äî they say they‚Äôve been ‚Äî suppressed, their views have been suppressed,‚Äù Steele concluded. It would be wrongheaded to assign too much significance to the broadcast ‚Äì after all, Steele‚Äôs comments were made unbidden over the course of a minute or so on an hour-long programme listened to by an unknown number of people (although BBC World Service does boast an audience of 319 million globally overall). Time now for people with power and influence to support the brave people who are speaking out about @OPCW corruption and Western war propaganda. @alextomo @bbclysedoucet @CraigMurrayOrg @ClarkeMicah @2ndNewMoon @rogerwaters @SusanSarandon https://t.co/JpHD6JfItF ‚Äî Piers Robinson (@PiersRobinson1) October 28, 2019 However, it notably marks the first time the whistleblowing of internally-silenced OPCW investigators has ever been mentioned in the mainstream media - and a small but growing number of journalists, including the British Mail on Sunday‚Äôs Peter Hitchens, and Italian La Repubblica‚Äôs Stefania Maurizi, have begun questioning the organisation on how and why these dissenting views came to be suppressed, albeit to little avail as yet. With more people enquiring, the OPCW will become ever-more unble be to avoid commenting on the scandalous suppression of evidence contrary to what was increasingly clearly a preordained conclusion of the Assad government‚Äôs culpability for the apparent chemical weapons attack.",

    "description": "BRUSSELS (Sputnik) - The issue of Denmark giving a permit to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline through its territorial waters was discussed only in the framework of bilateral talks between Russia and the European Commission, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on the Rossiya 24 channel.",
    "articleText": "‚ÄúWe discussed this issue in bilateral negotiations with the European Commissioner, Mr Sefcovic. We emphasized once again that this is a commercial project, Europe is interested in it, we expressed a negative attitude towards possible sanctions on the project. Therefore, we discussed this issue only in the framework of bilateral relations\", Novak said when asked if there was a deadline for obtaining the permit for Nord Stream 2 from Denmark. Earlier in October, the head of Austrian oil and gas company OMV, Rainer Seele stated that the operator of Nord Stream 2 ‚Äî a pipeline expected to bring gas from Russia to Europe via the Baltic Sea ‚Äî believes that there is a good chance a construction permit from Denmark will be secured. Russia‚Äôs energy giant Gazprom said on 1 October that 83 percent of the pipeline project was completed. It will carry an annual 1.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to Germany and further on to Central Europe. Of the five countries it will traverse, Denmark is the only one withholding its permit, but Gazprom hopes that it will eventually be greenlit. Russia Hopes EU-Russia-Ukraine Gas Talks to Bring Clarity on Transit, Deliveries Energy Minister Alexander Novak continued by saying that Russia expects the upcoming trilateral EU-Russia-Ukraine gas consultations to bring some clarity in terms of the future of Russia's gas transit through Ukraine and gas deliveries to the country after existing contract expiration. While the existing transit and deliveries contracts expire at the end of the year, the parties have not yet reached consensus. ‚ÄúEveryone is set to find all the necessary solutions and ensure reliable gas pumping, gas transit from 1 January 2020. We will continue to work actively both at the ministry and company levels‚Äù, Novak said when asked if the countries would agree by 31 December. According to Novak, the trilateral consultations of Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission on gas were carried out constructively, the next round will be held at the end of November. \"We have highlighted once more that there are still risks of our colleges being too late, and as a backup option, we are ready to facilitate the extension of the gas transit agreement, which is currently in force, for 2020. Although if our Ukrainian colleagues are ready to work according to the European law, we will be ready also to provide gas transit through Ukraine per that law\", Novak stated. Russia and Ukraine will have to intensify company-level discussions on mutually acceptable rules for Russian gas transit through Ukraine specifically in terms of tariffs and rules pursuant to the integration of EU legal norms and standards in Ukraine, Novak said. \"In the near time, we will have to intensify our contacts at the level of companies, at the level of Gazprom and Ukrainian companies, in regards to working out, among everything, the most acceptable rules of interaction between the Russian and Ukrainian operators of the gas transit systems. We will also study in the near future the methodology published on October 25, the methodology of determining the tariffs on gas transit across the territory of Ukraine. We wait for them to be published not only in Ukrainian but also in English, and it will be discussed soon, and we will analyze the competitiveness of these tariffs as compared to other routes\", Novak said following the trilateral EU-Russia-Ukraine consultations on gas transit earlier in the day. The agreement reached by Russian President Vladimir Putin and then-Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in 2009 is set to expire on 31 December, creating uncertainty regarding the future of this transit route. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a joint venture of Russia‚Äôs Gazprom and five European companies.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US forces in Syria will continue to counter Daesh* operations with its partners and further maintain its existing mission to protect oil fields there from the terror group, Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said during a press conference.",
    "articleText": "\"Our mission remains what it was in 2014 to (ensure) the continuing defeat of ISIS*. US troops will remain positioned in the strategic area to deny ISIS access to [oil]‚Ä¶ The United States will remain focused to defeat the ISIS coalition\", Esper told reporters. Esper said he expected at the end of the day there would be fewer US troops stationed in Syria than before, indicating that he did not expect to deploy more troops in that country despite their continuing mission to secure the oil fields that had previously been used by Daesh to fund its terror. Baghdadi's death would not rid the world of terrorism, but it would send a warning to terrorists who thought they could hide from the reach of the US armed forces, Esper said. \"The United States has the power to hunt to the ends of the earth those who wish to bring harm to [its] people\", Esper said. Turkey continues to bear responsibility for the consequences of their unwanted incursion, Esper added. The US military task remained to secure the oil fields in the region and to continue to secure the area, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley said during the press conference. The statements come after Donald Trump stated that the US forces hunted down Baghdadi in Syria's Idlib and thanked Russia, Iraq, Syria and Turkey for their assistance in the course of the operation. Russia, in particular, \"treated [the US military] great\" and opened the Syrian airspace under its control for the US fleet of helicopters to access Baghdadi, the US president claimed. The Russian Defence Ministry, in turn, said that it had not possessed any reliable data about the US operation and had reasons to question the realness of it. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist group banned in Russia",

    "description": "UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) - The United Nations cannot verify the credibility of the United States‚Äô statement announcing the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Daesh* terror group, and believes that such information has to be confirmed by the various authorities on the ground, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said in a press briefing.",
    "articleText": "‚ÄúWe cannot personally verify the accuracy of this‚Äù, Haq said referring to the announcement of al-Baghdadi‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúWe trust the reliability of the various sources of information that have been speaking up, but, obviously, any sort of information would need to be verified by the various authorities on the ground‚Äù. The United Nations Monitoring Team on terrorist groups cannot confirm the killing of Abu Bakr Baghdadi, the Daesh leader, but takes American statements seriously and is going to engage with the United States to confirm it as soon as possible, the coordinator of the team, Edmund Fitton-Brown said in an interview. ‚ÄúNo, I don't have any confirmation of this. Our methodology is so that we treat the news with caution until we hear it expressed to us directly and in confidence by member states. All we have so far is the public announcement from the Americans, but it does seem like a very confident announcement. They seem very sure of themselves. They claim that they have verified it. And, of course, they would be setting themselves up to a considerable embarrassment if they hadn't. So I think that should be taken very seriously. I will be asking questions to Americans and others to try to get confirmation as soon as possible‚Äù, Fitton-Brown said. The Monitoring Team is specifically mandated to liaise in confidence with counter-terrorism agencies of the UN member states. The potential demise of the Daesh leader could mean ‚Äúquite a lot‚Äù, Fitton-Brown said. According to the UN team coordinator, Daesh has been spreading propaganda that puts the movement itself above an individual, as ‚Äúevery human being is replaceable‚Äù. ‚ÄúBut I think the problem that they have is that this is happening just after they had the body blow of the military collapse earlier this year. They are in the situation where regenerating the leadership was more difficult than it would have been at another time, and they tried to do that, but there are lots of risks, because how do they position somebody? How do they get that person the loyalty and the authority that Baghdadi had, and how do they get all of that communicated without putting that person in the crosshairs as well? So I think for ISIL* this can be a very serious blow. But it's not enough to say that this is the beginning to the end, because they have too much support, I think, for it to be quite as dramatic as that‚Äù, Fitton-Brown said. Daesh does not have the same ‚Äúclear structure‚Äù as another terrorist group, al-Qaeda*, Fitton-Brown said. ‚ÄúWith al-Qaeda, you have a much greater sort of certainty of the order of succession. With ISIL for whatever reason yes, there are deputies, but there isn't one person who has been put forward as the heir apparent. So I think that's also a challenge for them‚Äù, he added. The Monitoring Team is subordinate to the Security Council and the committees that deal with Daesh, al-Qaeda and the Taliban*. Two main functions of the Team are providing a threat assessment report on the three groupings and maintenance of the sanctions, as well as advising UN member states on whether to add or remove individuals or entities from the sanctions list. The statements come after US President Donald Trump announced a day earlier the United States has hunted down al-Baghdadi in Syria's Idlib province and thanked Russia, Iraq, Syria and Turkey for their assistance during the course of the operation. In the meantime, the Russian Defence Ministry said that it had possessed no reliable data regarding the US operation and had reasons to question its credibility. Al-Baghdadi made his first media appearance in 2014 when the terror group declared itself a caliphate under Baghdadi's leadership. Since then al-Baghdadi made headlines multiple times with claims that he had been killed. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS), al-Qaeda, Taliban are terrorist groups banned in Russia",

    "articleText": "Usually invisible gravity waves have been captured while moving through clouds over the Indian Ocean from Western Australia, as images taken by the Japanese weather satellite Himawari-8 on 21 October revealed. A gusty south easterly surge over NW WA - perhaps enhanced by outflow from last night's thunderstorms over the Northern Interior - carries a plume of dust out over the Indian Ocean. pic.twitter.com/TqySYPa3NL ‚Äî Andrew Miskelly (@andrewmiskelly) October 21, 2019 A longer animation highlighting the atmospheric gravity waves.

In some cases, cloud forms on the crests. pic.twitter.com/af6kfO2U9Q ‚Äî Andrew Miskelly (@andrewmiskelly) October 22, 2019 Also known as buoyancy waves, gravity waves represent a physical phenomenon where waves are generated in any fluid medium, including our atmosphere, usually created by obstructions to airflow such as mountain ranges or by clashes between air masses with different temperatures. ‚ÄúEssentially gravity waves are disturbances in any sort of fluid, so we see them often in water, but the atmosphere is a fluid as well ‚Äî so any sort of disturbances in there can generate waves‚Äù, senior meteorologist from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Adam Morgan explained to ABC. ‚ÄúWhen you think of waves in the ocean, they're a type of gravity wave‚Äù, he added. The captured gravity waves are believed to have been triggered by temperature differences from thunderstorms in Australia's Pilbara and Kimberley regions, spreading to the Indian Ocean. While this phenomenon is usually invisible to the naked eye, this time gravity waves were particularly visible due to a large plume of dust originating from the storms. \"When we do see them it's usually when there's enough moisture in the air to form a bit of cloud along the leading edge of the gravity wave\", Morgan said. ‚ÄúThe cold outflow that falls out of that thunderstorm is quite gusty and those gusts have picked up a lot of dust and pushed it offshore\", meteorologist added. ‚ÄúSo when you look at the satellite image, it actually looked quite impressive‚Äù. Gravity waves are not believed to pose any danger to humans.",

    "articleText": "US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Alexander Milley stated that the disposal of Daesh leader Baghdadi's remains has been completed. He also said that the US is not prepared to release photos or video of the Baghdadi mission at this time, as they are classified. \"I'm not going to classify the video, what we do have and don't have at this time\", Milley said during the press briefing at the Defence Department. \"I've seen a lot and I'll wait until everything is appropriately declassified here in the coming days and we'll make sure you're provided that\".

Meanwhile, the Russian Defence Ministry stated that it doesn't possess any reliable data about the US operation and has reasons to question the reality of it, let alone its success. The reports about the death of the Daesh leader emerged amid Turkey‚Äôs recent Operation Peace Spring in north-eastern Syria to clear the area of Kurdish units and the Daesh terrorist group. The United States and Turkey came to an agreement on 17 October for a 120-hour ceasefire in the area to allow for the withdrawal of the Kurdish fighters. As the five-day ceasefire came to an end, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached a deal late on 22 October to pull the Kurdish fighters back and establish joint patrols in the operation zone in north-eastern Syria along the Turkish border.",

    "title": "Queen's Aide Reveals Monarch Agreed to Participate in Olympic Skit with James Bond on One Condition",
    "description": "Angela Kelly said that the monarch did not simply agree to appear in a skit made for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, but insisted that she should have a speaking part, a proposition, Kelly writes, that made director Danny Boyle almost fall backward.",
    "articleText": "It is probably not the best cameo in TV or movie history, but one that features the most famous monarch in the world - Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen‚Äôs aide has recently revealed that the royal insisted on saying the classic line ‚ÄúGood evening, Mr Bond\" when she was offered to appear in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics along with the start of the Bond saga, played by Daniel Craig. The footage itself shows Queen Elizabeth being visited by 007, who then accompanies the monarch to a helicopter that takes the two to the London Stadium. In the following scene, Bond and the monarch, played by stuntman Gary Connery, parachute into the stadium. In her memoir, serialised by Hello magazine, Angela Kelly describes how filmmaker Danny Boyle voiced his idea about the skit during his meeting with Kelly and the Queen‚Äôs secretary Edward Young. ‚ÄúI remember the look of shock on Danny‚Äôs face that I would be asking Her Majesty straight away, but there‚Äôs no point in waiting around with these things: if she said no, that would be the end of it‚Äù. But not only did the Queen immediately agree to participate in the ceremony, she insisted on a speaking part. ‚ÄúOf course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me‚Äù, the Queen said, according to the aide. Kelly, who has worked for the royal household as dressmaker and personal assistant for 25 years, then details how she had to create two identical peach outfits, one for Elizabeth II and the other for a stuntman, who portrayed her. Social media users were delighted to know that the Queen was so enthusiastic, with some saying that the best part in the ceremony, which featured performances of Paul McCartney, Muse, and Monty Python‚Äôs Eric Idle, was the James Bond skit with the Queen. Oh yes!! She was such a gem to agree to do that. A 'never to be foregoten' moment. ‚Äî Nesta (@Scraggs60) July 27, 2019 That was my very favorite thing about the Opening-but the whole Presentation was just splendid! ‚Äî Nrsting (@Nrsting) August 17, 2019 It seems that the news also ended the decades-old debate over who is the best Bond girl. Angela Kelly is the first serving member of the royal household who has been allowed to reveal details of her working relationship with the Queen. In her book titled ‚ÄúThe Other Side of the Coin: the Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe‚Äù, among other things, she details how the christening gown worn by Prince George, Prince Louis, and Princess Charlotte were dyed in Yorkshire tea to replicate the dress worn by Queen Victoria‚Äôs eldest sister in 1841. Kelly said the tea brand was chosen as it was the strongest.",

    "description": "Georgian ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, wanted on corruption charges back home, has had his previously revoked Ukrainian citizenship restored. However, he expressed an intention in early summer to soon travel back to Georgia.",
    "articleText": "Georgia‚Äôs Ministry of Internal Affairs has launched investigation into a cyberattack in which President Salome Zurabishvili‚Äôs website sported an image of the country‚Äôs former head of state Mikheil Saakashvili, accompanied by the inscription ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back‚Äù. The presidential website was hacked on Monday, along with a whole range of other portals, such as information agency websites, as well as the online platforms of local councils, courts, etc. For the time being, the president‚Äôs website is not operating. The ministry‚Äôs press service detailed that an investigation is intensely being carried out, with criminal cases having been opened over hacking and infringement of intellectual property. Georgia has been seeking its former president‚Äôs extradition since 2014, indicting him on several criminal felonies, such as abuse of power and embezzlement of $5 million in state funds. In 2015, Saakashvili was appointed governor of Ukraine‚Äôs Odessa region by former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and renounced his Georgian citizenship upon obtaining a new Ukrainian passport. In the next two years, Kiev rejected several extradition requests by Tbilisi before ousting Saakashvili in July 2017 and revoking his citizenship. Saakashvili has since been staying in Warsaw, Poland, and although his Ukrainian passport has been restored, he has explicitly stated plans to return to his home country in the near future. \"One to three months\", Saakashvili told Ukraine‚Äôs 1+1 broadcaster in June, when asked about his comeback plans.",

    "description": "BERLIN (Sputnik) - The decision on the impossibility of cooperation and a coalition with the Die Linke (The Left) party and the right eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) remains valid amid the regional election in the German federal state of Thuringia, conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Chairwoman Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said.",
    "articleText": "\"We have been discussing this topic for a very long time at the presidium. But we again emphasized at the presidium and at the federal government that the decision of the party‚Äôs federal congress on cooperation and coalition with the Left and the Alternative for Germany remained valid. This was incontrovertible\", Kramp-Karrenbauer said at a briefing. According to the CDU head, the question of how the new government in Thuringia will look \"is in the competence of the incumbent Prime Minister of Thuringia [Bodo Ramelow]\". Die Linke is leading in the regional election with 31 percent of the votes, while AfD is in second with 23 percent, an exit poll showed on Sunday. According to the survey, conducted by the Mannheimer Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for the ZDF broadcaster, the Christian Democratic Union may count on receiving 22 percent of the votes, which would earn third place. Kramp-Karrenbauer assumed the office of CDU head on 7 December 2018, succeeding German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The politician, however, does not enjoy wide support among Germans, according to the polls.",

    "description": "Former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor visited Moscow last week to hold his first-ever press conference in Russia.",
    "articleText": "Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor revealed that the first ever bottle of his Proper No. Twelve brand whisky, which he handed to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the World Cup final in 2018, was taken by the head of state‚Äôs security team in order to test the safety of the bottle‚Äôs contents. ‚ÄúPresident Putin's security detail is second to none as I'm sure you know‚Äù, Conor said during the press conference in Moscow last week. ‚ÄúYou don't mess around with Vladimir‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo, I gifted the bottle, I gifted it to his security. So, they had to take the liquid from the bottle to make sure the liquid was safe and it was not maybe poisoned or whatnot and then it was gifted to Vladimir Putin‚Äù, the Irish mixed martial artist explained. While the former two-division UFC champion was unable to share a glass of his McGregor-branded beverage with the Russian president, he said that Putin promised him during their meeting at the World Cup last year that he would try the drink, with the Irish fighter confident that the Russian head of state would certainly enjoy a sip of Proper No. Twelve. ‚ÄúI'm sure he did have a taste and I'm sure he enjoyed it‚Äù, the Irishman added. Proper No. Twelve whisky was launched in September 2018 and it was revealed this May that it had already received a revenue of around $983 million. Conor McGregor has not fought for over a year after his fourth-round submission defeat to Russian mixed martial artist Khabib Nurmagomedov, but announced recently that his next UFC battle would take place on 18 January 2020.",
