    "articleText": "close Video Newt Gingrich reacts to current state of impeachment inquiry Senator Lindsey Graham has created a new reality for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Graham has written a powerful resolution which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined in co-sponsoring. Together they have attracted 50 co-sponsors – which means with Vice President Pence supporting them they would win a vote to dismiss any phony impeachment from the House that failed to meet a key standard of fairness. The resolution: “calls on the House of Representatives, prior to proceeding any further with its impeachment investigation into President Trump, to vote to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry; calls on the House of Representatives to provide President Trump, like every other American, with due process, to include the ability to confront his accusers, call witnesses on his behalf, and have a basic understanding of the accusations against him that would form any basis for impeachment; and calls on the House of Representatives to provide members of the minority with the ability to participate fully in all proceedings and have equal authority to issue subpoenas and other compulsory process.” Faced with this new reality, Speaker Pelosi suddenly ended months of avoiding a vote on the impeachment process and announced today that the House would vote this week. REP. JORDAN SAYS HOUSE IMPEACHMENT VOTE WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING: DEMS 'PUTTING LIPSTICK ON THE PIG' As a practical matter, the House Democrats had no choice but to bring the impeachment process to a vote. They were faced with a Trump administration that refused to cooperate with a secret investigation which lacked rules and authorization by the full House. They were also faced with a Senate that was prepared to reject a kangaroo court-style secret approach. However, the next test for Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrats will concern the kind of resolution they bring to the floor. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The House Democrats have a clear model of a fair, systematic bipartisan approach in the rules adopted by the Democrats in 1973 and by the Republicans in 1998. Former Democratic Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Peter Rodino of New Jersey developed a bipartisan set of rules in 1973 during the Nixon impeachment proceedings. Rodino’s rules allowed the White House Counsel to be present at all hearings – including those held in secret. They also allowed the Republican minority to offer subpoenas to bring in the witnesses they wanted in addition to the witnesses the Democrats wanted. When we were faced with an impeachment process in 1998, we sent a congressman to interview then-retired Chairman Rodino, and we literally adopted all of his rules. So, there is a bipartisan precedent for a fair, orderly approach to the impeachment process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER If Speaker Pelosi offers a resolution which includes these precedents – and if her resolution answers the 10 questions Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has written posed to her – then it is possible the impeachment process will be back on a bipartisan track.

Democrats ought to ditch the partisanship and laud his demise Tom Del Beccaro: California, PG&E, we can't go on like this. Here's what you need to understand If, however, Speaker Pelosi introduces a resolution to continue the secret kangaroo court-Star Chamber-partisan approach Representative Adam Schiff has adopted, then the vote will be meaningless. If the House Democrats fail to heed the warning of the Graham-McConnell Resolution, they will be setting up all their efforts to be dismissed out of hand by the senators who have called on them for real reforms in the current impeachment process. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Graham and McConnell have already had a big impact in just a few days. They are now poised to judge whether the Democrats’ proposed rules represent real fairness and real bipartisanship or are simply more of the same dishonest, secretive, one-sided baloney Schiff has served up so far. It will be very interesting to see what kind of resolution Speaker Pelosi brings forward. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH",

    "articleText": "close Video Tucker: Left uses ISIS leader's death to criticize Trump Trump administration orchestrates raid to take out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It was a moment that should have united this fractious country -- we could use it. Instead, it became more fodder for those who profit from our division. On Sunday morning, the Trump administration announced that thanks to a successful military raid in Northwest Syria, the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed. ISIS SPOKESMAN ABU HASSAN AL-MUHAJIR, POTENTIAL AL-BAGHDADI SUCCESSOR, ALSO KILLED IN SYRIA, OFFICIAL SAYS President Trump: He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. He was a sick and depraved man. And he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward running and crying. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. \"Sick and depraved,\" it turns out, is not an overstatement. As the head of the ISIS caliphate, Baghdadi ran one of the most gruesome death cults in human history. In Syria and Iraq, his followers murdered untold thousands, beheaded them, and drowned them, and set them on fire, often on camera. In the U.S. and in Europe, terrorists pledging alliance to Baghdadi killed hundreds in mass shootings, bombings and vehicle attacks. So Baghdadi's death is really nothing less than a victory for civilization itself. And yet, here in Washington, many complain that Trump had dared to kill him. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whined that she hadn't been given appropriate notice of the operation -- as if it were all about her. Former Obama National Intelligence Director James Clapper, meanwhile, told television viewers that, somehow, the killing of the ISIS leader would make ISIS stronger. And then on CNN, some compared the president to ISIS. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN senior international correspondent: There were lots of moments during Donald Trump's speech which jar to some degree. Some of which sort of echoed, frankly, the crudeness you would often expect to hear maybe from ISIS about the whimpering, screaming Baghdadi pinned down in a sealed tunnel. It was so disturbing to hear to some degree. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Philip Mudd, CNN counterterrorism analyst: You do not celebrate death. I don't care if it's a terrorist. I don't care if it's someone you hate. A human being has died. We don't celebrate that. I would not use that and I find it -- it's embarrassing. \"I would not use that language,\" says the guy who is making a career out of screaming and foaming on television. Over on CNN.com, meanwhile, one of the reporters compiled a listicle called \"The 41 Most Shocking Lines from Donald Trump's Baghdadi Announcement.\" -- CNN really reaching new lows every day. You're watching the flailing of a leadership class that despises the country it governs. They loathe the elected president so much, they're incapable of acknowledging any accomplishment, no matter what it is. And then there was Max Boot, always the most deranged probably because he is also the dumbest. Boot complained that Trump wasn't respectful enough of Baghdadi: \"Trump could not have heard whimpering and crying because there was no audio. The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\" In other words, says Max Boot, Baghdadi was a hero of sorts and shame on Trump for calling him a coward! Well, that sounds kind of far-out. You should know that MSNBC devoted significant coverage to the question of whether Baghdadi actually \"whimpered\" before he died. More from Opinion Cal Thomas: Al-Baghdadi's death is a big deal. Democrats ought to ditch the partisanship and laud his demise Tom Del Beccaro: California, PG&E, we can't go on like this. Here's what you need to understand Andrew McCarthy: There's no basis for Barr to recuse himself over Ukraine Geoff Bennett, NBC News White House correspondent: He was talking about Baghdadi's final moments. Take a listen to this:. Trump: \"He died after running into a dead-end tunnel whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\" Bennett: But as you point out in the piece, there was no live audio from the raid. So square that circle for us. \"Square that circle.\" It's beyond parody. Well, that award goes to the Washington Post. Here's how that paper chose to announce Baghdadi's death: \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at the helm of Islamic State, dies at 48.\" That's one for the scrapbook. You can find it with other memorable headlines from history. \"Goal-oriented German leader with distinctive mustache found dead in bunker.\" \"Joseph Stalin, former seminarian and movie buff, dies peacefully at 74.\" \"Usama bin Laden, husband to five, killed in home invasion.\" Video So what is this about? Well, ultimately, you're watching the flailing of a leadership class that despises the country it governs. They loathe the elected president so much, they're incapable of acknowledging any accomplishment, no matter what it is. Trump is bad. Trump killed Baghdadi. Therefore killing Baghdadi was bad. That's how these purported geniuses actually think. They are purely reactive about everything, not just the death of terrorists. These are the very people who sat by idly as our entire middle class died. And then China rose to take America's place as leader of the world, and virtually alone among political figures, Trump noted these things. \"Hey, what's going on?\" he said. He ran on those issues and he won. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And in response to that, rather than learn something, our leadership class took the opposite side. They took the side of the fentanyl smugglers from Mexico. They took the side of our mortal enemies and the fascist government of China. Those are not positions you would take if you cared about your people. But at this point, it is pretty obvious, they hate Trump far more than they love America.

    "articleText": "close Video Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi dead in US special operations forces raid Retired Lt. Col. Daniel Davis says Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was one of the most heinous and barbaric individuals on the planet. Only extreme partisans intent on denying President Trump any credit for any success would be critical of the operation he ordered that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. These extreme partisans include Speaker Nancy Pelosi who, while praising the “heroism” of the special unit that conducted the raid on al-Baghdadi’s location in Northern Syria, could not bring herself to say anything nice about the president. Instead, she said the House should have been notified in advance. Why? Does the House command troops? Pelosi lamented that Russia was informed, but that was because Russian weapons and troops were in areas over which American helicopters flew in order to reach their target. Kudos to senator and presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar, who said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that the president’s decision was a “good one.” She even acknowledged without rancor that it could benefit him politically. PIERS MORGAN BLASTS TRUMP CRITICS AFTER AL-BAGHDADI RAID: THEY 'SHAMED THEMSELVES AND SHAMED THEIR COUNTRY' In a Sunday morning appearance at the White House, the president reminded forgetful Americans of the type of organization al-Baghdadi led. He recalled prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits, who were shown on videos with knives at their throats and later beheaded. He also said, “Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way — as a coward, running and crying,” For much of the world this was a “Wizard of Oz” moment when the curtain is pulled back and the man behind it is not as frightening as he appeared to be. Some commentators on various TV networks kept referring to al-Baghdadi’s “ideology.” His was more than an ideology. Communism is an ideology. Fascism is an ideology. What motivated al-Baghdadi and other ISIS fighters was religion. When one believes he is on “a mission from God,” to invoke a line from the film “The Blues Brothers,” there is little to stop him, other than death. Radical Islamists believe their death in fighting us “infidels” is a guaranteed ticket to Heaven. How does one deter that, other than by helping them punch their ticket? More from Opinion Steve Hilton: On Trump impeachment Democrats thought they found their 'smoking gun' -- he fires blanks Rep. Jim Banks: Trump was right on al-Baghdadi move – Dems could not be trusted with info about secret mission James Carafano: Al-Baghdadi is dead –Trump was proven right on this one. So now what? Radical Islam is a virus. It is not contained within borders. It does not have a capital that can be bombed. That is why its evil nature must always be exposed and its goals thwarted. Yes, others will sign up and those currently ISIS members will likely be even more motivated by revenge. Still, others may see the cowardly behavior of al-Baghdadi and be motivated to either quit the organization, or not join it in the first place. Americans have a short attention span and need to have their memories jogged from time to time about the multiple threats that confront all free people who wish to maintain their freedom, which is never cheap. One of the cable channels has been showing the film “United Flight 93,” the story of the hijacking of one of four planes on Sept. 11. This is the plane that Todd Beamer and other passengers saved from likely hitting the Capitol or the White House by breaking into the cockpit and driving the plane into the ground in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The film portrays the religious motivations of the four Muslim hijackers and their brutality as they stabbed and slashed the captain, co-pilot and several passengers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Thinking about the flawless operation by American forces brought to mind Lord Byron’s classic poem, “The Destruction of Sennacherib.” It includes this line: “For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast, And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed; And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill, CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!” Our troops deserve praise, as does the president for making this happen.

The numbers regarding the wildfires in California are mind-boggling. So far, 54,000 acres and nearly 100 structures have burned. Worse, over 80,000 buildings and businesses are threatened by a fire that is just 5 percent contained. It is hard to even fathom. I must admit, even as a person who has written and talked about this situation -- and personally knows people impacted by it, to a degree all those statistics remained just numbers. I could look at those numbers and the fire in safety. Indeed, I was in New York analyzing it all on \"Fox & Friends\" when it became so very real. While I was preparing another article, I received a text from a good friend. She asked if I needed a place to stay. I had no idea what she was talking about. She proceeded to tell me she read that parts of my relatively small town in California were being evacuated.

Then I spent the next four hours trying to get updated information. I contacted friends, pleading with one to abide by the evacuation while telling others to pack and asking another to visit my home — just 1.2 miles as the ember flies from the evacuation zone. Video Some told me things were under control, and others didn’t. Good information was almost as uncertain as the wind direction, or so it seemed.

So too are many in the city of Windsor, which sits on the edge of the fire.

Things have been done wrong and things must change. California must recognize that decades of poor power line maintenance and allowing overgrowth near power lines (a policy choice) mixed with high winds and dry conditions (not new to California) are taking their toll. The changes must start with those in California government realizing that their most important mission, from the governor on down, is public safety — not their brand of social justice. There will be no social justice for all of those who lost their homes and livelihoods, if not their lives. PG&E must no longer bow to environmentalists who dictate that trees can only be trimmed to a few short feet from power lines. During high winds, that is no buffer at all, not to mention how quickly the trees grow back. Beyond that, our power companies cannot have their core mission — delivering safe and reliable power — be compromised to achieve environmental goals. I suggest that a scorched earth is not environmentally sound. Simply stated, it is time for those environmentalists to put immediate public safety ahead of their fervor. It is also irrational that PG&E cuts power to residents and businesses, thereby cutting off means of communication when safety information is most needed. These fires in California, the hurricanes of the South and the tornadoes in between demonstrate just how vulnerable our disaster communications are. Imagine if our power grid was attacked from abroad. The dislocation would dwarf what we have seen to date. A better crisis communication system must exist in this high-tech age.

Picture the frowning Democrats, sitting in front of their televisions on Sunday morning, realizing that Donald Trump just threw a bucket of paint on the portrait of a Don Quixote in the Oval Office making foreign policy decisions in the Middle East willy-nilly.

    "articleText": "close Video Wind-driven wildfires in Northern and Southern California destroy homes, force evacuations Millions of Californians brace for more power blackouts amid strong winds; Claudia Cowan reports from Santa Rosa, California. California, the richest state in the nation—and one that’s often portrayed as the progressive harbinger of the future for the rest of the country—has been hit with its latest Third World-style disaster. On top of high poverty rates, skyrocketing homelessness, rising crime, and the return of medieval-sounding diseases, the state has been hit by a series of rolling, widespread blackouts. Millions of Californians, many in the most densely populated parts of the country have had their power shut off by the utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric. GETTY FIRE BURNS HOMES IN LOS ANGELES: WHAT TO KNOW The scale of these blackouts is unprecedented in the history of California. The local utility, PG&E, initiated the blackout in an effort to limit the potential for mass wildfires, which ravaged the state in 2018 and bankrupted the company. Exposed power lines and infrastructure make the likelihood of sparking fires much greater in places where there is ample dry fuel (more on that later). Still, the fires are back this year. The blackout, which has hit cities throughout Northern California, is causing chaos: businesses have to shut down, people can’t go to work, and in some blacked-out areas, curfews have been put in place to prevent crime. It’s a mess. Much of the blame for the blackout has been hurled at the utility, with some even turning to vandalizing PG&E offices and shooting at its trucks. Though it’s easy to criticize PG&E, which hardly looks good in this whole mess, there is a lot of blame to go around—and no, it doesn’t have anything to do with “climate change.” Poor land management has been a major contributing factor to the uptick in massive wildfires in the West and around the country. California is particularly susceptible. Fires need heat, and they need fuel. At certain times of the year in California, the state is hot as dry winds blow in from Nevada, a combustible environment for fire. That’s hardly a new situation in the Golden State. Unfortunately, there’s now far more fuel in our forests that has built up over decades because of a change in forest management strategy. Former California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, who now lives in Texas, has done a great job of highlighting this issue and explaining how the blackout crisis was largely caused by politicians. Renewable energy has been prioritized over reliable infrastructure, DeVore recently wrote in The Federalist, while there has been an uptick of vulnerable power lines to connect distant wind farms to urban centers. PG&E shifted its priority to the overpriced renewables at the behest of politicians, The Wall Street Journal explained in an article aptly titled “California’s Dark Ages.” For years, the utility skimped on safety upgrades and repairs while pumping billions into green energy and electric-car subsidies to please its overlords in Sacramento. Credit Suisse has estimated that long-term contracts with developers of renewables cost the utility $2.2 billion annually more than current market power rates. Now, in large parts of California, if you want to keep the lights on during the blackouts, you better have a flashlight or a gas lamp. Twenty-first century green dreams have led to 19th-century realities. The Dark Ages indeed. Worse than the misguided green energy push and poor infrastructure, of course, has been the shifting forest management strategy—mostly the result of misguided environmentalist ideology—that turned large swaths of the state into a tinderbox. “With a decline in the harvest came a decline in the allied efforts to clear brush, build and maintain access roads and firebreaks,” DeVore wrote in The Federalist. “This led inexorably to a decades’ long build-up in the fuel load. Federal funds set aside for increasingly unpopular forest-management efforts were instead shifted to fire-suppression expenses.” More from Opinion Liz Peek: Trump reveals Al-Baghdadi's death -- Terror fight's big win still can't get liberal media's approval James Carafano: Al-Baghdadi is dead –Trump was proven right on this one. So now what? Newt Gingrich: China-Russia military alliance would have incredible impact on US One failure led to another as poor forest management has necessitated vastly increased budgets for putting out the fires, which will undoubtedly continue to be a threat. Further, DeVore noted, these fires pose more danger to people than ever before as middle-class Californians flee the state’s expensive urban areas to the more affordable, but also more at-risk parts of the state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER So, the current blackouts are ultimately the result of short-term reality and long-term dysfunctional governance. California is a wealthy state with vast natural advantages and near-limitless potential for growth. It’s why so many Americans have moved there over the past century. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite those attributes, California’s future success looks, well, a whole lot darker due to political dysfunction and the inability to address the growing problems facing the state.

While history isn’t over, the question remains: What does the future hold? Here is what we know for sure. Video ISIS has now suffered two devastating psychological blows. The first was the obliteration of their territorial “caliphate.” Baghdadi’s obliteration is the second.

We have to work with allies. And we have to remain vigilant here at home. It would also be great if we could put aside the endless political squabbling.

    "description": "Amb. Bill Taylor was not the smoking gun or anything close. He is a bust.",
    "articleText": "close Video Steve Hilton: The truth about impeachment Amb. Bill Taylor's testimony revealed nothing new, just embellished what we already knew. Last week, the Democrats could barely contain themselves as they thought they'd found their smoking gun on Trump's impeachment: Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.: I think it's very damning. And you know, I think it puts a politically mortal peril at this presidency. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif: Devastating to Donald Trump. Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich. This is my most disturbing day in Congress. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. It's shocking, it really is shocking. \"Shocking,\" \"devastating,\" \"mortal peril\" ... they are so ridiculous, these people. What got them so excited? The testimony of Bill Taylor, our ambassador to Ukraine, who apparently claimed the president wanted to withhold military aid and the White House meeting, unless Ukraine's new president publicly said he would investigate not just 2016 election meddling, but the Bidens, too. STATE DEPT. BLOCKED STATEMENT BACKING EX-US ENVOY TO UKRAINE, DIPLOMAT TESTIFIES: REPORT Taylor's claim is also in his published witness statements. So what's the truth? Well, we don't know all of it because this whole thing is still being run in secret. The Republicans calling out the secrecy has led to a new talking point for the Democrats and Trump-hating media. The facts are bad for the president, so all they can do is attack the process. That is nonsense. And here's why -- with facts. One, there was nothing new in Bill Taylor's testimony. Essentially, he just embellished what we heard weeks ago when a bunch of text messages were leaked. Two, when Taylor was questioned about his quid pro quo claim, his story fell apart. Video \"What the Democrats wanted to believe was that Ambassador Taylor's testimony would support what the whistleblower said when in fact, his testimony established the opposite,\" Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Three, Bill Taylor's story was also contradicted by another diplomat closely involved in all of this, Kurt Volker. Volker was interviewed by the impeachment committee weeks ago, but you didn't hear the Democrats and the ruling class state media jumping up and down about that. Why? Because, as we told you weeks ago, his evidence exonerated President Trump on the main impeachment charges. This was not the smoking gun or anything close. Bill Taylor is a bust. Looks like the Democrats' love for those career diplomats they have fallen over only extends as far as the ones who want to get President Trump. So no, this was not the smoking gun or anything close. Bill Taylor is a bust. He claims he is not political or biased and says he has worked for Republicans and Democrats. That's not the point! This is about populist versus establishment, insider versus outsider, and not Republican versus Democrat. This is the system striking back. More from Opinion Rebecca Friedrichs: Chicago unions stage a fake crisis to grab power Michael Goodwin: Why are Democrats acting like they have something to hide? Liz Peek: Trump reveals Al-Baghdadi's death -- Terror fight's big win still can't get liberal media's approval Of course, Bill Taylor is political. Of course, he is biased, just like all these career civil servants coming out of the woodwork. They want power without accountability. And the very people who lecture us about democracy and the rule of law put these bureaucrats on a pedestal instead of exposing them for what they are -- arrogant, stuck up knolls trying to take down a president who is challenging the system and its power. And finally, if Bill Taylor is such a fine, outstanding, unbiased servant of the people, why the hell didn't he call on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens? Joe Biden has boasted about controlling aid to Ukraine. Joe Biden: I said, \"you're not getting a billion. I'm going to be leaving here.\" I think it was what? Six hours? I go, I said, \"I am leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.\" Well, son of a b---h, he got fired. As we keep telling you, the real scandal is not the firing of the prosecutor. It is cash for gas -- billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer cash controlled by Joe Biden going to Ukrainian energy interests, including Burisma, where his son was on the board. How much taxpayer money did Joe Biden give to a Biden family business? Why didn't Bill Taylor want to look into that? Oh, because along with Biden, he is part of the establishment and this is how they roll. And by the way, to all these Democrats pompously pontificating that it damages our national security to hold up Ukraine military aid, do you know who did that first? Your precious President Obama. He refused to arm the Ukrainians against Russia at all. It was President Trump who did. Video This whole partisan impeachment farce is the biggest crock of you know what since the last one they put out there, which consumed this country for three years and proved to be nothing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We know what this is about. They hate Trump. They hate you for voting for him in 2016, and they're terrified you'll reelect him in 2020 because Trump has got the economy booming. He has delivered his promises and the candidates they've got are all useless. Finally, this is not just about the president personally. It's about his policy agenda and the populist movement.

    "articleText": "close Video Striking teachers march on Chicago City Hall head of mayor's budget address Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says there is not enough money to meet the demands of teachers; Mike Emanuel reports from the scene. Teachers want to teach. Teachers' unions — by contrast — want power. That’s why unions hijacked the teaching profession. That’s why unions order their teachers out of the classrooms and onto the sidewalks, abandoning students to hold cities and neighborhoods hostage until the union agenda prevails. Unions employ strikes because they work. Teachers, controlled by brute force, obediently fall in line. Nervous politicians buckle when faced by cities full of angry parents whose kids have nowhere to go. Then unions get what they want — billions in tax-free dues to fund their radical leftist takeover of our schools and republic. REBECCA FRIEDRICHS: TEACHERS, YOUR UNIONS MIGHT SUPPORT TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT BUT THEY'VE ABANDONED YOU This exact union strategy is playing out in Chicago right now. For the third time since 2012, Chicago’s teachers’ unions have pulled teachers from the classrooms and put them on picket lines, leaving 361,000 students and their families abandoned for days. They’re asking for a 16 percent pay increase, but Chicago teacher salaries already range from $53,000.00 to over $125,000. And that’s before adding in Cadillac health care and pension benefits. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER They’re marching for smaller class sizes, but many Chicago classrooms are undersized. More from Opinion Liz Peek: Joe Biden is pandering to teachers unions -- It could cost him with critical voters John Lott: Armed teachers can save student lives – Don’t leave children defenseless against school shooters They’re also marching for hordes of new support staff to address the campus chaos created by union-supported “equity” policies. You see, unions promote dangerous anti-family/anti-student/anti-teacher/anti-American policies in our schools and communities. Once chaos ensues, unions place the blame on poverty, parents, school choice, and a lack of funding. Then they call for “social justice” strikes to demand a fix to the problems. The fix? You guessed it! More dues-paying members and more money and power for the unions. This is why so many families want to escape public schools. So, diabolically, unions march to demand a moratorium on charter schools to the devastation of thousands of disadvantaged families. As a teacher who’s devoted my entire life to students, I’m motivated to defeat these devilish foes. Unions gained their stronghold over teachers because we were forced by law to fund them for 50 years. That’s why my colleagues and I sued them to end forced unionism. Unions were livid. For the third time since 2012, Chicago’s teachers’ unions have pulled teachers from the classrooms and put them on picket lines, leaving 361,000 students and their families abandoned for days. Desperate to keep their hands on our money, union lawyers threatened the U.S. Supreme Court justices that if employees were freed from forced unionism, unions would react with an “untold specter of labor unrest throughout the country,” because “union security is the tradeoff for no strikes.” We won. So unions started pitching nationwide temper tantrums called “RedForEd” teacher protests — just like the strikes in Chicago. My teacher colleague Dr. Joseph Ocol always crosses Chicago’s picket line. You haven’t likely heard of him because unions silence good teachers. Joseph’s not willing to leave children unattended just because the union orders him to strike. One of his second graders was murdered while unattended — shot dead in the streets of Chicago. After that child’s tragic death, Joseph discovered 90 percent of his students lived below the poverty line and were most vulnerable between 3 and 6 p.m. So Joseph started an after-school chess club. Shortly after, the kids started winning state and national chess tournaments and blossomed under their newfound hope. That’s why he told union leaders, “I will join your strike if you will do something for the kids. I’m willing to teach the kids to play chess in the picket line.” But union leaders denied his request and showed no concern for the kids. Then they hassled Joseph for teaching instead of picketing, slandered him mercilessly in national news as a “scab,” and ejected him from union membership while continuing to take full dues from his paychecks. Repulsively, angry union activists even tried to shut down Joseph’s chess club. No wonder Chicago’s kids are falling apart. The Chicago strike, and the entire “RedForEd” strike movement, is a smokescreen. A deceptive power grab by unions. Their underlying motivation is to use America’s schools and teachers to grow the ranks of union soldiers and haul in billions more in tax-free annual dues to push their far-reaching leftist political agenda. Unions seek to abolish parental authority, introduce more chaos and indoctrinate the next generation of Americans in radical socialist ideals. This puts our republic — and our kids — in danger. That’s the bottom line. There’s only one way to end the nightmare. Teachers must reject unions to rescue our profession and our kids, and Americans must empower teachers to do so.

President Trump announced Sunday that U.S. special operations forces have killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the “world’s number one terrorist,” and “the founder and leader of ISIS.” Surely that is cause for celebration. Especially since in recent days New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, among others, have publicly fretted that the president’s recent effort to move our troops out of Syria would likely lead to a revival of that vicious terror organization. But no, not even a clear win in the fight against Islamic terror registers approval from the liberal media. Hours later, the Washington Post altered their initial obituary, which described al-Baghdadi as ”Islamic State’s terrorist-in-chief,” to call him an “austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State.” Sure, because heaven forbid the Trump administration actually gets rid of a bad guy and makes the world a little safer. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and others took to Twitter to deride Democrats and the media for dismissing the killing of the terrorist “as no big deal” and whining that they were not informed in advance. That was their response. DAN GAINOR: IMPEACH TRUMP? HECK, THE LEFT AND MEDIA WANT TO OVERTURN THE ENTIRE PRESIDENCY This is, of course, only the most recent example of how shamefully the liberal media treats President Trump. His supporters are sick of it, and so is he. Video Last week, President Trump canceled the White House subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post, and encouraged other federal agencies to follow suit. It was small; it was petty. But, after three years of taking a relentless pounding from the liberal media, it must have felt good. Thousands of other fed-up Americans have done the very same thing. The reaction of the liberal press was predictable – astonishment and outrage. How dare he? One incensed person likened the president to Mussolini; Vanity Fair’s headline called him \"Angry Little Man.\" Maureen Dowd, in the Times, blasted the “snowflake” president for not being an ardent Times reader (unlike President Obama) and confidently predicted he’ll “sneak back,” unable to stay away. Here’s the thing Ms. Dowd – you need Trump more than he needs you. We wonder what will become of the Times, and the Post, after President Trump leaves office. The half of the country offended by your offensive treatment of the man they voted for have moved on; they get their news from other sources now, sources that maybe deliver the news more fairly. Those clicks you love from your admirers will dwindle post-Trump. As you point out in your column, it is what you describe as Trump’s terrible behavior that sells papers. The stories cited daily in the Times as “most read” are mainly attacks on the president. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Trump’s exasperation with the liberal media is entirely understandable, and defensible. They have been relentless in their scathing criticism of his every word and deed from the moment he decided to run for president. Not a day goes by that the Times, for example, doesn’t lash out in the most vitriolic fashion. Why should his White House support such an organization? Why should the taxpayers who elected Donald Trump? More from Opinion Carol Roth: Canceling Halloween is not a solution – It only makes kids equally miserable Sen. Chuck Grassley: America will suffer if problems plaguing Midwest aren’t addressed by Congress Trump is not the only one disgusted with the media. Gallup has tracked opinion about the press over time; the most recent summary shows 28 percent of the country has no confidence at all in the mass media – a record. Another 30 percent said they had “not very much confidence” that the media was reporting the news accurately and fairly. Moreover, 42 percent of those surveyed thought the national news was too liberal, against only 13 percent who saw it as too conservative. Remember that the Times' publisher was so embarrassed to have completely missed the biggest political story of recent times – Trump’s victory – that he penned a sort of \"mea culpa,\" acknowledging the goof but also excusing it as the result of an “erratic and unpredictable election.” He recommitted the paper to its “fundamental mission,” which he described as reporting “America and the world honestly … striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives.” What nonsense. The Times makes zero effort to understand and certainly has never reflected the views of those who elected President Trump. I doubt there’s a single writer on their payroll who voted for Trump. Their antagonism of the liberal media costs the country dearly. Paul Krugman’s unceasing, erroneous columns talking down the economy (\"Here Comes the Trump Slump,\" \"The Day the Trump Boom Died\") dampen optimism. Consumer sentiment has mainly, thankfully, sailed right past the ominous whisperings of the economist most notorious for predicting that Trump’s election would ignite a stock market crash. But, the collective doom-and-gloom spread by Krugman and his colleagues does not move the economy, or the country, forward. The liberal press has harped relentlessly on the bad news and refused to herald good tidings, such as the positive impact of the GOP tax cuts. The campaign against the tax overhaul began even before the bill was written, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer badmouthing it as a handout to the wealthy and the liberal press falling in line. So successful, and so damaging was the concerted coverage of the tax bill that most Americans believed their taxes had actually gone up, even as the vast majority of the country actually saw them drop. Even the Times had to admit (eventually) that taxes fell for most Americans. They credited the confusion to “a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.” So, the liberal media lied about the tax bill, thus blunting the optimism it might have generated. It is also not helpful that the liberal media chooses to disparage the president every time he meets with another head of state. China’s President Xi Jinping may be trying to stall on a trade deal; some have speculated that he expects the president to lose in 2020 and has decided to wait him out. Wonder where he got that idea? The president is wrong to call the liberal media the “enemy of the people,” but he is not wrong that their coverage of his administration is biased. It is also often wrong. They were wrong about Trump in 2016, they were wrong about the Brexit vote, and they were wrong about the Trump team colluding with Russia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The liberal media is powerful; they could use that power to good effect. For instance, if the press aggressively backed Trump’s call for trade reforms from China, and used their influence to bring Americans aboard, it might speed an agreement. Or, if they are concerned about the plight of American farmers as they pretend to be, they might pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal to a vote.

    "articleText": "close Video Mary Anne Marsh: U.S. District Court decision may spell the end of Donald Trump's time in office Fox News contributor Mary Anne Marsh on why the release of the unredacted version of the Mueller report to Congress could reveal a pattern by Donald Trump of seeking foreign assistance for his campaigns in 2016 and 2020, which is illegal and bolsters the impeachment inquiry. “If we were confident the president did not commit a crime we would have said so,” Special Counsel Robert Mueller said at a May press conference after releasing his eponymous report. Now, we may find out what Mueller was talking about. On Friday, as Trump and Republicans continued to attack the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., issued a decision that may have sealed Trump's fate. Howell ruled that the Department of Justice must provide Congress with the unredacted version of the Mueller report as well as the grand jury testimony and related materials. The unredacted information disclosed in the report could answer what did Trump know and when did he know it. Specifically, Howell’s ruling sets into motion a series of events that could reveal Trump knew in advance about the emails stolen by Russia and released by WikiLeaks in 2016 to harm Hillary Clinton. The events are the release of the unredacted Mueller report to Congress by October 30, the Roger Stone-WikiLeaks trial scheduled to begin on November 5, and the public impeachment inquiry hearings by the House that will start a week or so later. Collectively, these three events could show a pattern by Trump of seeking foreign assistance for his campaigns in 2016 and 2020, which is illegal and bolsters the impeachment inquiry. REP. JIM BANKS: ADAM SCHIFF LIES ABOUT TRUMP REPEATEDLY – SHOULDN'T BE LEADING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Remember, Congress never received the unredacted Mueller report with the grand jury testimony and related materials they are entitled to because Attorney General William Barr wrongly withheld it since Mueller submitted his report to Barr last April. Now Congress is about to get it and that could be the undoing of Trump. More from Opinion Dan Gainor: Impeach Trump? Heck, the left and media want to overturn the entire presidency Marc Thiessen: Democrats not serious about Trump impeachment – Inquiry is all about politics First, Howell’s decision not only requires that the redactions, grand jury testimony and underlying evidence in the Mueller report be released to the House Judiciary Committee by Oct. 30, but it also established that the impeachment inquiry is legitimate. “Tipping the scale even further toward disclosure is the public’s interest in a diligent and thorough investigation into, and in a final determination about, potentially impeachable conduct by the president described in the Mueller report,” Howell said. The Mueller report contains many redacted passages of interest, including possible references to a call between Trump and Stone about the release of emails by WikiLeaks that could confirm Michael Cohen’s testimony about it. Cohen alleged to the House Oversight Committee last March that Trump received a phone call from Stone between July 17 and 20, 2016, informing him that WikiLeaks was planning to release emails that would damage Hillary Clinton. By the end of that week, WikiLeaks posted thousands of emails stolen by Russia in an attempt to disrupt the Democratic National Convention and harm Clinton. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In addition, the alleged call between Trump and Stone is likely to be addressed in the Stone-WikiLeaks trial scheduled to start in Washington on Nov. 5. Stone faces a seven-count indictment that includes one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering. The combination of the unredacted Mueller report and the Stone trial could confirm whether Trump knew about the release of the emails from Stone in advance. Finally, the House plans to begin public hearings into the impeachment inquiry about a week after the start of the Stone-WikiLeaks trial. The inquiry is focused on the call by Trump to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and the relationship between the release of military aid and the pressure to investigate Joe Biden. If the unredacted Mueller report and Stone trial reveal that Trump knew in advance that the stolen emails were going to be released, then it establishes a pattern by Trump of seeking foreign assistance to help his campaigns. That is illegal and thereby bolsters the investigation into his call to Zelensky. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Such disclosures would further increase public support for Trump’s impeachment and removal from office. The combination of the facts, evidence, and public support would force many, if not most, Republicans to support Trump’s impeachment as well. The stretch between Halloween and Thanksgiving could bring the greatest threat to Trump to date with much to fear and little to be thankful for. It may well be the beginning of his impeachment and the end of his time in office. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARY ANNE MARSH",

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, former leader of ISIS, was killed in a raid by U.S. Army Delta Force and Rangers in Syria. This is a momentous occasion with at least as much significance strategically as the death of Al Qaeda head Usama bin Laden. We can now identify a clear end point for the Islamic State caliphate in Iraq and Syria because the self-proclaimed caliph himself is dead. Baghdadi and bin Laden led rival views of jihadist conquest. Al Qaeda preferred to remain dispersed and occasionally pop up to conduct terror attacks. They grew affiliated groups in many places, but never tried to hold ground as if they were a nation. ISIS, however, quite obviously ran up their black flag of jihad in Iraq and Syria and ruled a large quasi-state with oil revenue and even rudimentary government for several years. The success Baghdadi achieved is worth noting. For a while there was a physical caliphate the global jihad could point to and claim they had accomplished a major goal of the Islamist movement worldwide. But even if they thought it would last and grow, their atrocities meant the civilized world could never countenance that. JOHNNY 'JOEY' JONES: CELEBRATE BAGHDADI'S DEATH — AND AMERICA'S RESOLVE TO FIGHT TERROR And as Al Qaeda noted, this planted a target on them. The U.S. built a coalition to cut down their black flag and now we have also cut the head off the snake. Now, what is the U.S. exit strategy for Syria? CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER President Trump has instituted a good part of the plan we were asked to write by the National Security Council almost two years ago for an End Game in Syria. We based it on these identified threats: “The danger that Iran will otherwise end up with de facto control of the Sunni areas and safe transit across Syria is extremely high. A third major Sunni insurgency is also likely if Iran or its proxies control these areas. Turkey is negotiating a separate peace with Iran and Russia for control of the North.” More from Opinion Rubin and Vatanka: US can maximize pressure against Iran's leaders while helping its people Newt Gingrich: China-Russia military alliance would have incredible impact on US James Carafano: Trump follows Founding Fathers’ foreign policy, author finds Our plan called for three main objectives (though the U.S. could not get the Kurds and Turkey to agree after two years of negotiations): A buffer zone for Turkey to contain the PKK Kurds, a U.S.-designated terror group. Protection for the Syrian Kurds, who helped so much in the victory over ISIS. Security of oil resources so Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran cannot use them. The United States was never interested in a permanent presence in the region and certainly not in Syria. Now we must solidify the gains we have made and make a few last pushes to ensure that Assad and Iran do not have a path to undo these successes and create the land bridge to the Mediterranean the mullahs in Tehran so desperately crave. There are gains in leverage for Turkey and Russia in the arrangements we have made, but those who are crowing that this was a giveaway to Vladimir Putin and Recep Erdogan should consider what, if anything, has been given. Turkey is trying to build a buffer zone to stop PKK terror attacks but maintaining that is going to be an ongoing fight against terror groups that have a new set of atrocities to rally around. Putin’s major gains have mostly been media-based as he is credited for a win that really wins him nothing but trouble. Russia’s only strategic interest in Syria is the airbase and naval port, both of which are far removed from all of this. The United States was never interested in a permanent presence in the region and certainly not in Syria. We were there to kill the ISIS caliphate and we have done that convincingly. Russia and Turkey may be left with a mess of simmering insurgency and civil war that could remind them to be careful what you wish for. So, what should the US wish for? 1. Deny a land bridge or Shia Crescent across Iraq and Syria that allows Iran to control and supply the region. 2. Empower the Kurds and Sunni in Syria by working with regional allies to rebuild and create trade. 3. Push Erdogan and Turkey to decide whether they are a U.S. ally per NATO or not. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The America First foreign policy President Trump has enacted is a pragmatic approach grounded in the idea that we cannot be involved in open-ended foreign deployments with no clear objectives or path to victory. We can and will act decisively when an urgent U.S. strategic interest is threatened and no tyrant around the world should feel emboldened or safe. But we will not be the neighborhood watch sticking around to make sure things can’t go bad again. That is a job for the people whose neighborhood it is. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JIM HANSON",

Today Americans should celebrate. Today we should acknowledge the blood and treasure, as President Trump says, spent on fighting our enemies and eliminating terror around the world. The death of this villain, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is not just a Trump administration accomplishment and it’s not just a single military operation. This victory is brought to us by years of deployments, thousands of U.S. troops losing limbs and sacrificing their lives, and a generation determined to seek vengeance and justice abroad so terror doesn’t strike us at home. Today should quiet voices of partisanship and give way to celebrating a moment in history when honorable men and women executed orders and brought some semblance of justice to four American families and countless innocent people around the world who have suffered from the actions of this religious perversion we call ISIS, which was led by Baghdadi. But that isn’t the Washington way, although I would argue it is the American way. TRUMP DESCRIBES AL-BAGHDADI AS 'WHIMPERING AND CRYING' BEFORE DYING IN US OPERATION: 'HE DIED LIKE A COWARD' Unfortunately, as fear and the fate of certain death reverberates through the minds of our enemies, partisan spin and political talking points will be strewn across D.C. and onto our TVs and phones.

Some may be so petty as to suggest that the death of Baghdadi isn’t the victory for Trump that killing Usama bin Laden was for Barack Obama. They’ll call this a calculated campaign move to help secure Trump’s re-election. However, when the sun rises tomorrow, one thing is unquestionably true: our number one enemy is dead. A man who left a trail of pain and destruction through evil acts and unimaginable terror saw his own life end after he was hunted down by American troops. More importantly, whoever takes his place knows his fate will surely be the same. Baghdadi may become a martyr and ISIS may not be fully defeated, but the message we have sent to the world is that we will never succumb to such evil. I served in Afghanistan. I lost my legs and more than a dozen friends there between 2009 and 2012, a decade after we invaded that country to eliminate the threat of Al Qaeda and kill Bin Laden. It’s no secret that distractions like Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Taliban muddied our fight in the War on Terror, both abroad and here at home. Politics and election rhetoric skewed foreign policy and defense strategy. That's why I believe we should welcome a president intent on disrupting such a cycle. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The day Bin Laden finally was killed, I felt a sense of accomplishment, a vindication for pain and suffering endured and witnessed. I knew he wasn’t calling the shots for Al Qaeda; I knew his death wouldn’t instantly make the world a better place. But his death did send a message that we are a nation intent on accomplishing our mission, even when our own politics seems to get in the way. We sent a similar message with the death of Baghdadi. We will not soon forget, we will not give up, and we will never quit. In the words of President Trump himself, “We will win.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "description": "Like all \"Medicare-for-all\" supporters, Warren is misleading the public about the damage her plan would do to the finances and health of every American.",
    "articleText": "close Video Warren teases plan to fund pricey Medicare-for-all Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will release a plan to pay for Medicare-for-all after sidestepping questions about raising taxes to fund the plan. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised to release her plan to pay for \"Medicare-for-all.\" Throughout her campaign, Warren has come under fire for refusing to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to fund her health care plan. Many of her fellow Democrats — including \"Medicare-for-all\" architect Bernie Sanders — have made clear that the plan would require tax hikes for everyone. But Warren isn't just dodging the tax question. Like all \"Medicare-for-all\" supporters, she's misleading the public about the damage her plan would do to the finances and health of every American. ARNON MISHKIN: DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL RACE HEATING UP – BIDEN, WARREN AREN'T ONLY CANDIDATES WHO COULD WIN Even \"Medicare-for-all\" supporters acknowledge it would be pricey. A new report from the left-leaning Urban Institute predicts the plan would cost $34 trillion over its first decade. Sanders has said that it could cost up to $40 trillion over 10 years. That's more than the cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security combined. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Warren claims she can finance \"Medicare-for-all\" by taxing the rich. But aggressively taxing wealthy individuals and corporations would only generate enough revenue to cover 40 percent of the cost of \"Medicare-for-all,\" according to a new study by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. More from Opinion Penny Nance: Hillary Clinton’s Tulsi Gabbard attack has taught us THIS Tucker Carlson: Elizabeth Warren embodies fakeness - no wonder Democrats are playing the Trump impeachment card Rep. Jim Banks: Adam Schiff lies about Trump repeatedly – Shouldn’t be leading impeachment inquiry That's why Sanders has floated a number of new taxes on almost every single American, including a 4 percent tax on each household and a 7.5 percent payroll tax. Sanders claims Americans would pay less for health care under \"Medicare-for-all\" than they currently do, even taking into account their higher tax burden. Warren has promised something similar — that \"Medicare-for-all\" would \"lower costs for middle-class families.\" According to an analysis by an Emory University professor, 70 percent of working, privately insured Americans would pay more for health insurance under a single-payer, \"Medicare-for-all\" system than they do today. But the evidence suggests otherwise. According to an analysis by Emory University professor Kenneth E. Thorpe, 70 percent of working, privately insured Americans would pay more for health insurance under a single-payer, \"Medicare-for-all\" system than they do today. They'd face even higher taxes if \"Medicare-for-all\" wound up costing more than projected. It wouldn't be the first time budget experts underestimated the cost of a government insurance program. In 1967, the House Ways and Means Committee predicted that the newly created Medicare program would cost around $12 billion by 1990. Medicare spending actually reached $110 billion in 1990. \"Medicare-for-all\" advocates claim that the focus on its cost to the federal government is disingenuous. We're already spending well over $3 trillion a year on health care. The Warren/Sanders plan would relieve individuals and employers of that spending — and re-apportion it to the federal government. Sanders and his allies like to cite a study from the libertarian Mercatus Center, which assumes that \"Medicare-for-all\" will adopt the existing Medicare program's low payment rates — and thus save the country $2 trillion over a decade. Of course, extending Medicare's payment schedule across the entire health care system would reduce payments to doctors and hospitals by 40 percent, relative to private insurance. And it would raise demand for care by 11 percent. In other words, \"Medicare-for-all\" posits that doctors and hospitals will have no qualms about treating more patients for less money. It's more likely that doctors and hospitals will respond to lower payment rates by reducing the supply of care they're willing to deliver. Americans would find themselves in the same position as patients in the United Kingdom's government-run National Health Service, where more than 4 million are currently waiting for care. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Those Britons pay an awful lot to wait in line. The average household in the United Kingdom pays over £5,000 in taxes each year just for health insurance. That's an increase of 75 percent since 2000. And it's likely to rise further. Two British think tanks predict that each British household will have to pay an additional £2,000 per year to keep the NHS running as the population ages. The American people are unlikely to reward politicians who raise their taxes by thousands of dollars — and then tell them to get in line for health care. Perhaps that's why Warren has been uncharacteristically mum on her plan for paying for \"Medicare-for-all.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SALLY PIPES",

    "articleText": "close Video Eric Shawn: Pres. Trump’s Iran sanctions ‘are working’ Fmr. Rep. Chris Gibson says pressure will force the regime back to the table. It has now been almost 18 months since Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued 12 demands to Iran and imposed a “maximum pressure” campaign to compel Tehran to change behavior. Critics are incorrect to say pressure against Iran cannot work: Overwhelming pressure and diplomatic isolation forced revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to release American hostages. Then, in 1988, he accepted a ceasefire in the Iraq-Iran War — likening it to drinking “from a chalice of poison” because the financial toll of unending war had grown too great to bear. To some degree, the “maximum pressure” campaign has also been successful. Ordinary Iranians feel the pressure. Despite their promises to the contrary, neither European, Russian nor Chinese partners have meaningfully come to Iran’s assistance. The country remains diplomatically isolated. NEWT GINGRICH: CHINA-RUSSIA MILITARY ALLIANCE WOULD HAVE INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON US Still, if any pressure campaign is to fully succeed, the Trump administration must remember what every president from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush understood: The Iranian public and the Islamic Republic are not synonymous. A 2012 survey conducted by Israeli political strategist Yuval Porat found that the Iranian society’s potential for liberal democracy exceeded countries like South Korea, India, Ukraine, and Romania. Coercion must target the Islamic regime, but not its people. Put another way, if the U.S. goal is to hobble or change Iran’s revolutionary regime, it is essential to empower the Iranian people rather than repress then. The former promotes freedom; the latter allows the Islamic Republic’s leadership to rally the public around the flag. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER A case in point where “maximum pressure” goes wrong is the broader 2017 travel ban which today restricts visas for Iranians and citizens of seven other countries. While Pompeo was wise to restrict U.S. visas for relatives of regime officials and to limit movement of Iranian diplomats in New York, the broader ban is demonstrably counterproductive. It undercuts the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s outreach to Iranian oppositionists at home and abroad. More from Opinion Andrew McCarthy: Trump can fight impeachment with THIS defense against Ukraine quid pro quo charge Tom Del Beccaro: California's power blackouts, energy nightmare and more are coming your way, America James Carafano: Trump follows Founding Fathers’ foreign policy, author finds According to a survey by Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian-Americans (PAAIA) — the largest grassroots Iranian American political organization — more than three-quarters of Iranian Americans say they oppose the ban. More than half of Iranian Americans, meanwhile, say that the policy has prevented attendance at family events like weddings, funerals, graduations or attending to relatives’ health emergencies. Maximum pressure could bring down the regime, but it could also snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. While Trump has been unable to show how the ban has advanced its goals, the policy hemorrhages Iranian goodwill and undercuts U.S. messaging in a country where almost 40 percent — 32 million people — are under 25, educated, and hold a positive disposition toward America. Rather than bludgeon Iranians, an effective pressure campaign would seek to drive a wedge between ordinary Iranians and their government. Reformism is not the answer. Not only do reformist politicians remain loyal to the theocracy, but they are also its fig leaves: While they hold out hope for gradual reform, they will never control the deep state institutions necessary to implement it. While Trump prefers to wield an axe, a scalpel would be more effective. A wiser regimen would fund trade unions — something progressives should be able to get behind — to simultaneously empower ordinary Iranians while forcing the regime to divert money away from weapons programs and proxy groups. Or, perhaps Defense Secretary Mark Esper could send hospital ships to Dubai and offer Iranian military veterans free health care. If they accept, it would be a propaganda (and perhaps intelligence) coup. If Iranian leaders restrict their travel, it will demoralize Iranian officers. After all, there can be no regime change without first splintering the Revolutionary Guards. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maximum pressure could bring down the regime, but it could also snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. In Iraq, maximum pressure crippled the economy to such an extent that, more than 16 years after regime change, the now-allied government still struggles to overcome its impact. What Iran needs is not maximum pressure, but smart pressure: Trump and Pompeo should wield a big stick against the regime, but if they seek positive change, then they also must both simultaneously shield the Iranian public from its bruises and perhaps even offer independent Iranian civil society some carrots.

I hate haunted houses and the gory side of Halloween. Why? There are many reasons, really, but here is one. In a day and age of alarming wickedness – from global terrorism to psychotic people who kill for the thrill of it – is it really wise to deliberately and voluntarily induce horror into our minds and our neighborhoods? CAROL ROTH: CANCELING HALLOWEEN IS NOT A SOLUTION – IT ONLY MAKES KIDS EQUALLY MISERABLE Go ahead, call me prudish or puritanical. Or boring. Or worse. The owners of McKamey Manor in Summertown, Tenn., obviously disagree.

Then there’s a cob-web covered house a few miles from where we live in Colorado Springs with mannequins hanging from the porch rafters. But wait – there’s more. A beat-up old car is parked in the driveway, a blood-splattered mannequin hanging out its window. The last piece of the gory display is a knocked over baby carriage, made to look like it was hit by the car, complete with a dead, bloodied “child” slumped on its side. More from Opinion Arnon Mishkin: Democratic presidential race heating up – Biden, Warren aren’t only candidates who could win Dan Gainor: Anti-Trump media dream up their scariest Halloween nightmare Christen Limbaugh Bloom: Could you be the answer to someone else's prayer? And they call this entertainment? I call it sick. My community is hardly alone. I suspect there are similar displays in your town. In recent years, Halloween has become big business. The National Retail Federation reported Americans spent $9 billion last year on costumes, candy and decorations. I assume the rise in the darker side of Halloween is attributable to a constellation of factors ranging from a rise in secular beliefs to the influence of media and the escalating nature of things. The degree of guts and gore notwithstanding, scaring people for entertainment likely dates back to the beginning of recorded history. Riveting tales of suspense are legendary. But like anything else, it’s human nature to escalate, push the envelope, and take things to the extreme. According to most historians, the origin of the haunted house can be traced back to 19th century England. In 1802, the French artist Marie Tussaud created a big stir in London when she sculpted and assembled a collection of “death masks” featuring the faces of guillotine victims. It was called the “Chamber of Horrors” – and at the time it generated an enormous cultural buzz. Believe it or not, Walt Disney, long considered America’s icon of wholesome family fun, is credited with launching the modern-day haunted house craze. Opening in 1969, Disneyland’s “Haunted Mansion” became a huge it, proving once again that Hollywood shapes culture in more ways than one. I have Christian friends who object to the holiday altogether, citing its pagan and creepy origins. I respect their convictions and have to admit that from a theological standpoint, I’m on shaky ground recognizing the yearly festival. Nevertheless, I’ve always enjoyed the innocent side of the Halloween or harvest holiday, first as a kid, and now as a parent. When I hear the rustle and crunch of fallen leaves underfoot, I’m transported back to hours upon hours of trick-or-treating on Long Island streets. My costumes included Superman, Batman as well as baseball and football players. It was always such great fun to carve pumpkins, bob for apples and roam the neighborhood in the crisp fall air with my brothers and sister, collecting the coveted candy and homemade treats our neighbors so generously dispensed. I’m looking forward to taking our boys trick-or-treating again this Thursday evening, hopefully adding to their storehouse of happy memories. But I assume the rise in the darker side of Halloween is attributable to a constellation of factors ranging from a rise in secular beliefs to the influence of media and the escalating nature of things. Psychologists will tell you that what was once titillating soon proves boring, leading producers to magnify horror productions to get the same thrill or chill. To be sure, I know there are a lot of fine people who enjoy a good scare and who feel they can easily separate the fact from the fiction. But the human mind is a tender, fragile, highly sensitive – and mysterious creation. The fact of the matter is that we become what we think about – and I’ve just never understood why anybody would want to ponder the ghoulish, inane and profane. As a favorite pastor used to say, “Garbage in, garbage out. What goes down in the well comes up in the bucket.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I’ve long appreciated the timeless wisdom of the Apostle Paul, who once advised his friends, “Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things.” If you ask me, that kind of advice is all treat and no trick.

Odom shared the moment on social media, saying that Schneerson, who is often referred to as 'The Rebbe,' shared 'a beautiful message of love and kindness to the world.' I asked myself this question the other day because of a recurring theme in my Bible study on the Book of Ephesians. Having read this book many times in the past, this study has personally reinforced for me the belief of many theologians, which is that the Bible always has new lessons to teach us, no matter how many times we’ve read it. For the first time, my eyes have been opened to the message of unity in the church woven repeatedly throughout the message of Ephesians. In fact, it’s so prevalent I’m shocked I never noticed it there before. I now realize that this theme of church unity probably never stood out to me because until very recently, I didn’t fully understand what “church unity” means at its core. I’ve heard the term “community” used countless times in church. But I’ve always associated this word with Bible studies and small groups. But through this study, God has enlightened my perspective on how I envision unity within the church. It began when my pastor, Josh Kelsey of C3 NYC Church, preached a sermon specifically on this topic. At that time, I had already known I’d be studying the Book of Ephesians in the next month, but had no idea the book was so focused on this idea. When I started reading through the study, I was amazed to find so many of the themes my pastor had preached just weeks before resurfacing through an entirely different medium. I love these instances when God makes things so obvious as though He’s waving a neon sign of the message in your face.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This verse makes clear that when individuals decide to put their faith in Jesus and follow Him, they automatically become part of something bigger than themselves: the church (Christ’s body). Being a part of this body shouldn’t consist solely of membership in a physical church or small group. God asks us to shift our perspective to seek every opportunity to help others know Him better, and to see every person as someone who He created to make the body of the church better. As Christians, we are not only called to encourage others and build one another up, it’s actually an essential part of God’s design for the church. We all need reassurance from fellow believers, and we each have something in ourselves – given to us by God – that others need from us. Paul warns us that if we fail to obey this command, we will never reach our full potential and neither will the church. God creates every human being for a specific purpose to contribute something unique to His body. With this in mind, believers should all think of themselves as potential answers to the prayers and problems of others.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES RESOLUTION ON IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS “Under House Rules you championed at the beginning of this Congress, major legislation is required to be posted 72 hours in advance of a vote,” they wrote. “Yet, here, on the gravest and most solemn work the House can do, you are forcing the House to consider a resolution with text that is still not available two days before the vote.” “Without text, we know nothing about the Democrats’ intended impeachment process. Your website describes the resolution as ‘directing certain committees to continue their ongoing investigation,’” they continued. “Chairman Schiff does not need a resolution to continue leaking selective facts from his basement bunker.” They added: “We can only assume, therefore, that this resolution is necessary to allow Democrats to subvert the ordinary legislative process.” The fiery statement from them and other Republicans indicates the looming vote will not ease their concerns about the process being used to investigate Trump over allegations he improperly sought a politically related investigation from Ukraine and may have used U.S. military aid as leverage — which the president denies. Republicans have for weeks complained about closed-door interviews being conducted as part of the probe and the lack of a formal House vote, challenging the legitimacy of the current framework for impeachment proceedings in the absence of one. McGovern and Pelosi, D-Calif., announced Monday that the House would indeed vote on a resolution to formalize and establish the parameters of the Trump impeachment inquiry. Pelosi made clear that the vote is being conducted because of the Republican complaints. “We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,” Pelosi said Monday. She accused Trump and his GOP allies of holding the position that \"because the House has not taken a vote, they may simply pretend the impeachment inquiry does not exist.\" The resolution is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a measure that sets process ground rules. But in their letter Tuesday, the ranking members went on to allege the resolution “will allow the Committees to ‘side step traditional time limits’ and allow unelected congressional staff additional time during public hearings to question witnesses.” “The Democrats’ entire impeachment process is fundamentally unfair,” they wrote. “It is rigged. The American people see through this partisan charade.” Video They added: “No matter how hard you try to legitimize this sham impeachment inquiry, it cannot hide the Democrats’ goal of relitigating the results of the 2016 presidential election.” Pelosi announced the Trump impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, saying at the time that \"the president must be held accountable\" for his \"betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\" The inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.

    "articleText": "close Video Fire crews race to tamp down Getty Fire hotspots before Santa Ana winds return to Los Angeles Eight homes were destroyed and thousands of residents remain evacuated after a wind-driven brushfire swept through the steep hills of Los Angeles' Brentwood neighborhood; national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports. Despite coming into office with a budget surplus of around $36 billion and enjoying favorable approval ratings, California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first year in office has been anything but tranquil. Newsom, who spent the previous eight years as lieutenant governor to Democrat Jerry Brown, has in the first 10 months of his term had to take the helm in dealing with a slew of pressing issues from a massive homelessness crisis and rising housing costs to sky-high gas prices and decaying roads. STRENGTHENING WINDS INCREASE SIZE OF MENACING KINCADE FIRE Now, with the state entering its traditional fire season, Newsom is grappling with massive wildfires everywhere from Los Angeles to the state’s storied wine region, while also fighting to limit blackouts by Pacific Gas & Electric Corp., the state’s largest utility provider -- in what is posing a complex and urgent challenge for his administration. “The next 72 hours will be challenging,” Newsom said during a press conference over the weekend. “I could sugarcoat it, but I will not.” GEYSERVILLE, CA - OCT. 25: Gov. Gavin Newsom surveys a home destroyed in the Kincade Fire, Friday, Oct. 25, 2019, in Geyserville, Calif. (Karl Mondon/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images) On Monday, fire crews across the state were battling a blaze in the star-studded hills around Los Angeles, forcing thousands of people to flee in the middle of the night and destroying several large homes. Up north in the Sonoma wine country, firefighters were trying to get a handle on an almost week-old blaze that doubled in just a day to at least 103 square miles. Adding to Californians' frustration was PG&E beginning another round of fire-prevention blackouts that are expected to affect nearly 600,000 customers in 29 counties, or about 1.5 million people, and leave them without power for possibly five days or more. PG&E’s move comes as the company admitted that a PG&E transformer malfunction and one of its power poles falling over may have been responsible for two smaller fires that broke out in the San Francisco Bay Area over the weekend. Video Despite acknowledging that it was in part his own responsibility to make sure blackouts did not happen, Newsom has roundly criticized PG&E and the state’s other utility companies’ failure to modernize electrical systems. He said shutting off power shouldn't have to be the alternative in a state that is so technologically advanced. MANY HOUSEKEEPERS, GARDENERS WENT TO WORK DESPITE GETTY FIRE EVACUATION ORDER: REPORT \"I have a message for PG&E: Your years and years of greed. Years and years of mismanagement. Years and years of putting shareholders over people. Are OVER,\" Newsom said Friday on Twitter. California’s Republican lawmakers were quick to point the blame at Newsom and the state’s Democratic supermajority. “[Gavin Newsom’s] FAILURE: 180,000 evacuated and 1 Million without power due to Democrats' INACTION to clear excess vegetation and secure power lines,” former Republican state assemblyman Travis Allen tweeted. “How much more do Californians have to endure of the California Democrat Party's failure and excuses?” Matt Shupe, a Republican political consultant in California, concurred with Allen’s comment – arguing that while the governor has done what he can to combat the wildfires, including declaring a state of emergency tapping into state and federal funds, the risk of wildfires could have been decreased if Newsom and state Democrats had taken a different approach with environmental policies. In their natural state, forests are regularly thinned by fire but the billions of dollars that the state spends fighting wildfires and restrictions on logging have allowed forests to accumulate an overload of vegetation and dead trees. “Newsom prides himself on being the most environmentally friendly politician,” Shupe told Fox News. “But there needs to be a more pragmatic approach than just leaving these trees to turn into tinder.” Video Many Californians affected by both the fires and the blackouts, however, are not blaming Newsom, but PG&E – saying the company is more concerned with keeping itself financially above water than with improving the safety of their lines. PG&E is in bankruptcy after its equipment was blamed for a string of disastrous fires during the past three years. Its stock dropped 24 percent Monday to close at $3.80 and was down more than 50 percent since Thursday. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's so obvious it's just to protect them from more liability,\" Janet Luoma of Santa Rosa said at a Red Cross evacuation shelter. Jeff Schlegelmilch, the deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told Fox News that the blame is likely shared by both the state government and the state’s power utilities. He said that these types of wildfires are likely only to increase given the effects of climate change and that instead of shutting off power – which he argues creates its own “pseudo disaster” – the state and power utilities need to think long term about how to deal with the problem. Video “Proper forest management is obviously key, but there needs to be more spending to update the power infrastructure in the state and make it safer,” Schlegelmilch said. He added: “The problem here is much bigger than just the response to the fires. These issues need to be addressed when talking about economic development and investment.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "description": "How late is too late?",
    "articleText": "close Video Hillary Clinton takes thinly veiled shot at President Trump at the funeral of Rep. Elijah Cummings Tammy Bruce, Charlie Hurt and Gina Loudon weigh in on Hillary Clinton's attack on President Trump. **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** On the roster: Dems ponder late entry: White knight or Don Quixote? - South Carolina priest refused Biden communion - Army colonel corroborates quid pro quo claims - Sessions said to be considering Senate return bid - Dirty birds DEMS PONDER LATE ENTRY: WHITE KNIGHT OR DON QUIXOTE? How late is too late? That’s the question some anxious Democrats are asking as they look beyond the existing field of 2020 candidates for potential nominees to face President Trump. In the week since a NYT report about Democratic donors looking for new candidates to enter the race was published, there’s been quite a bit of huffing and puffing over the possibility. It’s a fun Washington parlor game, no doubt. But is it anything more than that? From a practical perspective, it’s probably already too late for all but the most famous, best-liked political figures in the nation to build a campaign that could compete. And that’s a very short list indeed – one that, by our thinking, currently comprises just one person: Michelle Obama. But what if someone other than the former first lady wanted to launch a bid at this late date? Names mentioned for a late launch include former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and former Vice President Al Gore. Candidates like those would certainly make a splash upon entry, but it’s hard to imagine that any of those microwaved leftovers would be more than yet another second-tier contender in a crowded field. This is already a group in which well-known sitting senators are struggling to get to 3 percent of the vote after months of campaigning and millions of dollars spent. It just doesn’t stand to reason that the aforementioned – especially those only begrudgingly accepted by Democrats in the past – would be doing much better. As Nate Silver points out, while some Democratic elites may be unsatisfied with their choices, the party as a whole is quite happy with what’s on offer. Polls show very high levels of satisfaction among Democratic voters. And the only place to start would be in attacking the frontrunner, Joe Biden, a move that would only further alienate voters. Maybe the party insiders are right that the field is actually weak, but if voters don’t agree, a late entrant looks like Don Quixote, not a white knight. And if a candidate like that did want to run, it’s not just the constraints of politics that would be challenging, but the electoral calendar itself. Democrats have frontloaded their primary schedule for this cycle in hopes of a swift decision. That means that the filing deadlines for key contests are now just weeks away, including New Hampshire on Nov. 15. More ominously for potential late entrants, Democrats will allocate more than a third of all delegates on Super Tuesday in the first week of March, which means major filing deadlines are fast approaching. The biggest prize of them all, California, requires candidates to file by Nov. 26 for its Super Tuesday contests, with other delegate-rich states like Texas and Massachusetts following soon thereafter. It may not technically be too late for a candidate with deep pockets and a well-known name to launch a candidacy, but it will be soon. And practically speaking, it’s probably already past time given the demands of fundraising and organizing. If Democrats do end up with a split decision and a contested convention this summer, it’s possible that delegates could turn to a party elder not already on the ballot. But barring a meltdown in Milwaukee, Democrats will almost certainly have to choose from among those already running. The musings of donors at dinner parties will more likely slip from memory more quickly than their last bottle of Beaujolais. SOUTH CAROLINA PRIEST REFUSED BIDEN COMMUNION Florence [S.C.] Morning News: “Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church’s 9 a.m. Mass. … ‘Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,’ Morey told the Morning News via email. … Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. ‘I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,’ Morey added.” The storm of Biden media coverage seems to have passed - FiveThirtyEight: “When news about President Trump’s call to Ukraine first broke in late September, it seemed like former Vice President Joe Biden would be inextricably linked to the story. Biden was mentioned in more cable news clips and online news stories that week than every other 2020 Democratic candidate combined, according to data from the TV News Archive, which chops up cable news across the three networks we monitor — CNN, MSNBC and Fox News — into 15-second clips and Media Cloud, a database of online news. That week, Biden was mentioned in 74 percent of cable news clips, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the next most-mentioned candidate, was only in 16 percent of clips. In the past two weeks, however, as the initial flood of impeachment coverage has ebbed, so has the extra attention for Biden.” Bernie gains ground in New Hampshire - CNN: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (21%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18%) are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden stands a shade behind at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg rounds out the field of four who reach double-digits with 10%. Behind that group, three candidates land at 5% in the poll -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Andrew Yang. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who stood at 9% in a July New Hampshire poll, now holds just 3% support.” Harris blames her ethnicity, gender for poor performance - National Review: “Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris described electability as the ‘elephant in the room’ of her campaign and pondered whether America is ready for a woman of color to be commander in chief. ‘Essentially, is America ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president of the United States?’ Harris said in an interview with Axios on HBO. ‘There is a lack of ability or a difficulty in imagining that someone whom we have never seen can do a job that has been done 45 times by someone who is not that person.’ The same conversation happened when Barack Obama ran for president, the California senator added. Harris has been especially vocal about both racial justice and women’s rights during her 2020 campaign.” Harrop: Amy, what’cha wanna do? - Real Clear Politics: “A new piece in The Economist, ‘Amy Klobuchar for sanity,’ urges Democrats to give the senator ‘a look.’ It portrays her as an exemplar of Midwest pragmatism who could become a moderate alternative to Joe Biden. Mayor Pete's ace is his fine intellect and military service in Afghanistan. … His support for extending health coverage to undocumented immigrants has political strategists slapping their heads. Democrats don't like talking about this, but Buttigieg's outwardly gay identity, as well as his tender age of 37, could work against him in a national election. That leaves Klobuchar as one of the more plausible Democrats to beat Trump. Her momentum follows a frontal assault on Elizabeth Warren's ‘Medicare for All’ plan during the debate. Klobuchar called it a ‘pipe dream’ that would require a significant tax increase on the middle class.” THE RULEBOOK: TRICKLE DOWN “Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13 TIME OUT: UNDER PONTIUS PILATE NatGeo: “Pontius Pilate is a man many Jews and Christians love to hate. For Christians, the Roman governor of Judaea played a central role in the execution of Jesus around A.D. 30, while for Jews he was a callous ruler who set the stage for the rebellion that led to the destruction of Jerusalem four decades later. But a new discovery suggests that Pilate also spent a good deal of time and money embellishing the famous city that drew Jewish pilgrims as well as visitors from around the Roman Empire. Archaeologists tunneling beneath a Palestinian neighborhood just south of Jerusalem’s walls are uncovering a monumental stepped street that led to the foot of the Temple Mount, the sacred platform that once held the Jewish Temple and now is home to some of Islam’s holiest sites. The impressive walkway stretched more than a third of a mile, was 26 feet wide, and required some ten thousand tons of limestone slabs.” Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.

ARMY COLONEL CORROBORATES QUID PRO QUO CLAIMS WaPo: “National Security Council Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s testimony in the House impeachment probe Tuesday is shedding new light on how Trump administration officials pressured Ukrainian leaders into investigations that could benefit the president, corroborating other witnesses with a firsthand account of the alleged attempt at a quid pro quo. Vindman’s prepared remarks directly challenge the testimony of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who defended the president’s actions and told House investigators that no one had raised concerns about them. Sondland told the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., in September text messages saying [Donald] Trump had not engaged in a quid pro quo; those text messages were provided to investigators by former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker earlier this month.” House to vote Thursday on impeachment procedures - Fox News: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday the House will vote this week on a resolution to formalize -- and establish the parameters -- of the Trump impeachment inquiry. In a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution ‘affirms the ongoing, existing investigation’ and ‘establishes the procedure’ for future investigative steps. ‘We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,’ Pelosi said. Fox News has learned the vote will take place Thursday on the House floor. It is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a resolution that sets process ground rules. … The White House argued Monday that the move proves Democrats have been conducting an ‘unauthorized’ inquiry.” Pelosi looks to keep pressure on GOP with vote - The Atlantic: “The House will be on recess next week, and Democratic members will have to address the impeachment inquiry when they meet with their constituents. For lawmakers in swing districts, the fear of having to take a vote on impeachment—which drove Pelosi’s initial decision not to have one—may have given way to anxiety that the GOP’s accusation of railroading has been resonating with the public. And for most of the party, a vote shouldn’t be difficult: All but a handful of House Democrats have already come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry… Polls have shown a significant bump in support for impeachment since Pelosi announced the start of the inquiry, and it’s less of a vulnerability for Democrats. The pressure will now be on Republicans: Will those like Representatives Francis Rooney of Florida, Will Hurd of Texas, and Mark Amodei of Nevada, who have voiced concerns about Trump’s actions, back the formal opening of an inquiry?” SESSIONS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING SENATE RETURN BID Politico: “Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is strongly considering jumping into the race for his old Senate seat in Alabama, according to multiple Republican sources familiar with the matter. Sessions would scramble the already crowded field of Republicans seeking to take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a 2017 special election to fill the remainder of Sessions' term and is widely viewed as the most vulnerable senator on the ballot next year. … Sessions, 72, must decide within days whether to run: Candidates have until Nov. 8 to qualify for the ballot. Five Republicans are already in the race: Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court judge who lost the special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.” North Carolina to toss GOP-drawn House map - The [Raleigh, N.C.] News & Observer: “North Carolina’s 2020 congressional elections must happen under new maps, a panel of judges ruled Monday evening, saying that the current Republican-drawn maps are unfair to many voters. The legislature must now redraw the state’s 13 U.S. House districts. The judges — two Democrats and one Republican from different parts of North Carolina — wrote that the maps show signs of ‘extreme partisan gerrymandering’ which ‘is contrary to the fundamental right of North Carolina citizens to have elections conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people.’ Monday’s ruling, a preliminary injunction, said the state may not hold any elections for Congress using the current maps passed in 2016. … The judges ruled that if there aren’t new maps in time for the primary elections on March 3 then they could delay all or some of the primaries until later in 2020.” PLAY-BY-PLAY U.K. heading toward an early general election to break Brexit deadlock - NBC News Ross Douthat: The overstated collapse of American Christianity - NYT America’s largest private coal producer, Murray Energy, bankrupt after failed Trump rescue bid - Bloomberg AUDIBLE: NAH “I'm not missing anything.

DIRTY BIRDS Anchorage [Alaska] Daily News: “Alaska’s ravens and crows are shiny black pranksters… Rock-dropping black birds — maybe ravens, maybe crows — are accused of smashing out glass in a half-dozen vehicles parked at Soldotna’s Central Peninsula Hospital last week. Keith Randall, the hospital’s security manager, heard about the spate of broken windshields, rear windows and sunroofs and figured he was dealing with a vandalism problem. Randall quickly realized he was. But it wasn’t humans doing the damage. The evidence pointed to black birds… Off-duty nurse Cathy McDaniel was killing time in her pickup … when she heard a giant boom… McDaniel saw a rock. She saw her shattered sunroof. She tossed the rock on the ground -- and saw a black bird fly down, pick it up, and fly off with it. … The hospital posted a Facebook story about the rock-wielding birds. Several commenters shared stories of their own encounters with ravens.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The lovable old guy [Bernie Sanders] with the big crowds and no chance at the nomination is hardly taken seriously (except by Hillary Clinton, whose inability to put him away reveals daily her profound political weakness).” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Chicago Tribune on June 2, 2016.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com A federal judge issued a ruling Tuesday blocking an Alabama law that would make abortion a felony in nearly all situations, regardless of the stage of the pregnancy. U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, temporarily preventing the law from being enforced as a lawsuit over the law brought by abortion providers moves forward. ALABAMA JUDGE THROWS OUT TEEN'S LAWSUIT AGAINST ABORTION CLINIC ON BEHALF OF ABORTED CHILD \"The court is persuaded that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the Act violates an individual's constitutional right to obtain a pre-viability abortion, and thus that it violates her constitutional rights,\" the ruling said, noting that \"banning abortion before viability violates Supreme Court precedent.\" The law, known as the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, would make it a felony for anyone to perform an abortion, except in situations where a doctor determines that there is a \"medical emergency\" related to the mother's physical condition or if the fetus has a \"lethal anomaly\" that would cause it to be stillborn or die soon after death. The law would not have punished women receiving abortions. Alabama legislators approved the measure this year, hoping to mount a court challenge to abortion rights. The law was set to take effect Nov. 15 and is the most hardline of the anti-abortion measures enacted this year, as states emboldened by the new conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court take aim at Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "articleText": "close Video House to hold first vote on formal impeachment investigation Resolution will put lawmakers on the record as they head into a more public phase of the impeachment inquiry; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill. President Trump railed against Democrats Tuesday morning as he argued their party leadership is trying to \"destroy\" the GOP but will ultimately end up harming themselves. The president specifically mentioned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced Monday that the House will vote on an impeachment inquiry resolution on Thursday, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is heading up the ongoing closed-door probe. TRUMP DEFENDS KEEPING 'LEAKER' SCHIFF, PELOSI OUT OF THE LOOP ON AL-BAGHDADI \"Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party,\" Trump tweeted. \"Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by a corrupt politician, Adam Schiff!\" Trump is the latest Republican to criticize Democrats for their recent tactics. Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said Sunday that Schiff's Intelligence Committee has been so busy with impeachment-related activities that they have not had a briefing related to terrorism in \"well over a month.\" It comes as Democrats have complained that the president did not brief Pelosi or Schiff ahead of time on the weekend operation that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The president told reporters that he did not tell Pelosi about the raid beforehand because he \"wanted to make sure this kept secret” and did not \"want to have people lost.\" Similarly, Trump said Monday that he did not give Schiff advance notice of the raid \"because I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington,\" calling the House Intelligence Committee chairman a \"corrupt politician.\" Schiff's impeachment investigation continues Tuesday with the testimony of Army Lt.

    "articleText": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for Oct. 29 Fox News Flash top headlines for Oct. 29 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com George Conway, attorney and husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, launched into another tirade against President Trump on Tuesday, urging public officials and others to “just stop” defending the president and saying he “belongs” in prison. “To the members of Congress, public officials, and talking heads still defending @realDonaldTrump: Just stop,” he tweeted. “Especially the lying. He has no defense. Don’t go down with him in history in disgrace. The sooner we get this over with and he’s gone, the better off everyone will be.” KELLYANNE CONWAY, IN HEATED CLASH WITH REPORTER, SAYS HUSBAND 'GETS HIS POWER THROUGH ME' Responding to a tweet predicting that Trump will end up in prison, Conway added: “Absolutely he will. And it’s where he belongs.” Separately, regarding the recent boos Trump received at a World Series baseball game, where the crowd yelled “lock him up,” Conway described the chant as appropriate. “No — it’s the fact that he’s a criminal and the fact that this chant that came from his rallies couldn’t be more fitting to apply to him,” he tweeted regarding the impetus for the chant. KELLYANNE CONWAY'S HUSBAND MAKES AWKWARD APPEAL FOR 'SOMEONE' ON TRUMP'S 'RUNAWAY TRAIN' TO STOP HIM The comments are the latest in a stream of anti-Trump sentiment from Conway, who has clashed with the president for months. Trump has called George a “stone cold LOSER & husband from hell.” George Conway’s tweets have long attracted attention, considering Kellyanne Conway is a staunch defender of the president and has a reputation for wading into all media environments, hostile and friendly, to tout Trump’s agenda. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday from Fox News. Video That dynamic returned to the spotlight last week after audio emerged of the White House counselor scolding a Washington Examiner reporter for a reference to the Conway marriage in a story about Kellyanne Conway reportedly being considered for White House chief of staff. She later issued a statement in which she pushed back against personal questions she called “gossipy, inappropriate and irrelevant.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “I’ve previously noted that it is unusual – especially in Washington and especially in Republican politics – for a man to gain newfound fame and power through his wife, following his own stories, decades-long career as a respected and outstanding litigator in New York, which I have long admired,” she said. “Like every couple I know, George and I disagree on many big things and agree on many big things. Exactly none of it affects my position as Counselor to the President,” she said. “Exactly none of it is anyone’s business.”",

    "description": "The federal judge presiding over the case of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has canceled a hearing scheduled for next week, citing his lawyers’ latest motion -- which made a slew of misconduct allegations against the government while seeking access to supposedly exculpatory evidence.",
    "articleText": "close Video Flynn hearing canceled after brief allegedly reveals FBI manipulated interview records Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down the 'bizarre twist and turns' in the case against the former national security adviser. The federal judge presiding over the case of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has canceled a hearing scheduled for next week, citing his lawyers’ latest motion — which made a slew of misconduct allegations against the government while seeking access to supposedly exculpatory evidence. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan had scheduled a hearing for Nov. 7 with Flynn’s attorney and federal prosecutors in the long-running case, but said Monday it would no longer take place. FBI AGENTS MANIPULATED FLYNN FILE, AS CLAPPER ALLEGEDLY URGED 'KILL SHOT': COURT FILING “In view of the parties’ comprehensive briefing concerning 109 Defendant’s Motion to Compel Production of Brady Material, the Court cancels the motion hearing previously scheduled for November 7, 2019,” Sullivan wrote Monday. The cancellation comes just days after Flynn’s attorney Sidney Powell filed a 161-page brief demanding the government produce all evidence related to Flynn, while urging the court to “dismiss the entire prosecution for outrageous government misconduct” and hold the prosecutors in contempt. “#BREAKING: Judge Sullivan has canceled our hearing in early November because of the ‘comprehensive briefing’ of the parties,” Powell tweeted late Monday. It's unclear whether the cancellation signals the judge is considering Powell's demands. The explosive court document, filed last week, alleged that FBI agents manipulated official records of Flynn’s 2017 interview that led to him being charged with lying to investigators. The entire case against Flynn stemmed from the 2017 FBI interview, in which Flynn was asked about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding those conversations during his interview, as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Powell alleged in the court filings that FBI officials manipulated Flynn’s FBI 302 — a form used by agents to report or summarize interviews. It is not clear who may have done the alleged editing, though ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok was involved in the original interview. “Those changes added an unequivocal statement that ‘Flynn stated he did not’ — in response to whether Mr. Flynn had asked Kislyak to vote in a certain manner or slow down the UN vote [on sanctions],” Powell wrote. “This is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on the issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.” Powell also alleged that agents added: “or if Kislyak described any Russian response to a request by Flynn.” “That question and answer does not appear in the notes, yet it was made into a criminal offense,” Powell wrote. “The draft also shows that the agents moved a sentence to make it seem to be an answer to a question it was not.” FLYNN LAWYER WANTS PROSECUTORS TO TURN OVER CELLPHONES FROM MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR LINKED TO RUSSIA PROBE Powell also alleged that on Jan. 23, 2017 – the day before the FBI interviewed Flynn at the White House – “the upper echelon of the FBI met to orchestrate” strategies that would have Flynn talk “in such a way as to keep from alerting him from understanding that he was being interviewed in a criminal investigation of which he was the target.” “In short, they planned to deceive him about the entire scenario, and keep him ‘unguarded,’” Powell claimed. Powell went on to reference newly discovered text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page days following the publication of the salacious anti-Trump dossier; media leaks from the FBI and Justice Department; and details surrounding the unexpected recusal of the former judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras. Prosecutors have strongly rejected claims they're hiding evidence, saying recently \"the government has exceeded its discovery and disclosure obligations in this matter,\" including by providing Flynn with thousands of pages of documents. Federal prosecutors earlier this month called the defense's filings a “fishing expedition.” On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a response seeking guidance from the judge while raising concerns that Flynn's legal team is raising these objections even after a guilty plea. \"In an extraordinary reversal, the defendant now claims that he is innocent of the criminal charge in this case,\" the federal prosecutors wrote. \"He makes this claim despite having admitted his guilt, under oath, before two federal judges (including this Court.)\" \"The defendant also argues--based almost entirely on evidence previously provided in discovery--that the government engaged in 'conduct so shocking to the conscience and so inimical to our system of justice that it requires the dismissal of the charges for outrageous government conduct,'\" they continued, saying that for the \"first time,\" Flynn's legal team is arguing the government had \"an obligation\" to provide evidence to him \"prior to charging him in a criminal case.\" The federal prosecutors also criticized Flynn's team over process, arguing in their filing that \"issues may not be raised for the first time in a reply brief.\" \"In light of this minute order, it may be that the Court intends to strike any arguments or claims raised for the first time by the defendant in his Reply. And it may be that the Court plans to require the defendant to raise any new claims for relief in a properly pled motion to which the government can fully respond,\" they wrote. Powell’s defense of Flynn has caused an escalating battle with the government, with Flynn’s sentencing still up in the air for his guilty plea. The government said in late August that the case was ready for sentencing, after months of delay. Sullivan has set a Dec. 18 sentencing date, though it’s unclear whether it could be pushed off again.",

Alexander Vindman's opening statement to House lawmakers says he did not think it was proper to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen; Catherine Herridge has the details. A White House official testified behind closed doors Tuesday that he had concerns about President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the heart of Democrats' impeachment inquiry, according to prepared remarks -- as the president ripped the witness as a \"Never Trumper\" and challenged his account. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who serves as a director on the National Security Council (NSC), arrived Tuesday morning to testify before the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees. His prepared opening statement, obtained by Fox News, expresses concern over Trump's request to have Ukraine investigate political opponents. But in the run-up to the testimony, the president repeatedly swiped at the official via Twitter. PELOSI SAYS HOUSE WILL VOTE THIS WEEK ON RESOLUTION FORMALIZING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY \"Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call,\" Trump tweeted. \"Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!\" He went on to tweet: \"Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call 'concerned' today’s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\" He also tweeted: \"How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?\" The transcript of that call, as released by the White House, is available here. Indeed, Vindman said in his opening statement that he has \"never had direct contact or communications with the President.\" The statement says, however, that Vindman did listen to Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky, which prompted a whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of improperly trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic activities in the 2016 election, as well as Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The complaint then resulted in the impeachment inquiry being led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. As Trump alluded to in his tweet, Vindman said in his statement that he \"was concerned by the call\" because he \"did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen[.]\" Vindman also said that weeks before the phone call, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland made statements at a meeting with a Ukrainian official regarding Ukraine conducting investigations, and that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton \"cut the meeting short\" at that time. Vindman went on to say that during a debriefing after the meeting, Sondland discussed that it was important for Ukraine to investigate the Democrats, the Bidens and Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company for which Hunter Biden served as a board member. Vindman said he told Sondland that this was inappropriate and that he reported his concern to the NSC's lead counsel. Trump's call with Zelensky took place 15 days later, and Vindman said he was among those who listened to it in the Situation Room when it happened. Both Trump and Zelensky have stated that there was no pressure placed on Ukraine to conduct investigations. Others have alleged that Trump also held back military aid to Ukraine as leverage in seeking those investigations, though Trump insists there was no quid pro quo. Sondland, who testified Oct. 17, also said Trump told him there was no quid pro quo. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Also expected to testify this week are Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Kathryn Wheelbarger and the National Security Council’s current Russia and Europe director Tim Morrison. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday the House will vote this week on a resolution to formalize – and establish the parameters of – the Trump impeachment inquiry. In a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi said the resolution \"affirms the ongoing, existing investigation\" and \"establishes the procedure\" for future investigative steps.

    "description": "A bipartisan budget watchdog released a report Monday detailing options for how the federal government could pay for \"Medicare-for-all,\" the health care plan popular with 2020 Democratic presidential contenders -- and its findings show there would be no way to fund the expanded health program by simply raising taxes on the rich.",
    "articleText": "close Video Democratic rivals pile on Elizabeth Warren at presidential debate Candidates ease up on Joe Biden, focus on Sen. Warren during televised Democratic debate; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' A bipartisan budget watchdog released a report Monday detailing options for how the federal government could pay for \"Medicare-for-all,\" the health care plan popular with 2020 Democratic presidential contenders — and its findings show there would be no way to fund the expanded health program by simply raising taxes on the rich. The report, published by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, examines a variety of potential ways to raise the estimated $30 trillion over 10 years necessary to fund \"Medicare-for-all,\" including a 32 percent payroll tax, a 25 percent income surtax and a 42 percent value-added tax. These methods could all raise $30 trillion, the report says, but there is no way for the federal government to bring in that much money simply by taxing rich people. \"There is not enough annual income available among higher earners to finance the full cost of 'Medicare-for-All,'\" it says. \"On a static basis, even increasing the top two income tax rates (applying to individuals making over $204,000 per year and couples making over $408,000 per year) to 100 percent would not raise $30 trillion over a decade.\" An accompanying chart lists the tax-the-rich funding option as \"IMPOSSIBLE.\" HOUSE REPUBLICANS RELEASE PLAN IN BID TO FULFILL TRUMP PROMISE AS 'PARTY OF HEALTH CARE' The role of middle-class taxes in funding \"Medicare-for-all\" has become a point of contention in the Democratic primary, and it showed at the most recent debate in Ohio. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tiptoed around questions from the moderators about whether or not middle-class taxes would increase under her \"Medicare-for-all\" health care plan. Warren chose to focus on net costs instead. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families,\" she said. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who endorses a public option plan rather than Warren's single-payer \"Medicare-for-all,\" accused her of being evasive. \"Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except for this,\" he said. \"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is fond of reminding Democratic contenders endorsing \"Medicare-for-all\" that he \"wrote the damn bill,\" was more open than Warren about his plans to finance the $30 trillion health care plan. ELIZABETH WARREN'S CAMPAIGN IS AT A 'MAKE-OR-BREAK' MOMENT, SAYS CHARLES PAYNE \"It is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\" he said, “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.” A 32 percent payroll tax increase would bring the rate to 47 percent on most wage income, according to the CRFB report. A 25 percent income surtax would force the lowest federal income tax rates to 35 percent and compel the top earners to pay 62 percent of their income. The options for financing \"Medicare-for-all\" without increasing taxes are similarly immoderate. The CRFB says the federal government would need to cut \"non-health federal spending by 80 percent\" in order to pay for \"Medicare-for-all\" without increasing taxes. This would require cutting Social Security benefits from approximately $18,000 to about $3,600 each year and cutting troop numbers from 1.3 million to 270,000. If a Warren or a Sanders administration decided to finance \"Medicare-for-all\" simply on debt, consequences could be dire, according to the report. BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR SLAM WARREN FOR NOT SAYING HOW SHE'LL FINANCE 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' \"Deficit-financing 'Medicare-for-All' would be far more damaging to the economy,\" the report says. \"Assuming that such a massive increase in the debt would not roil financial markets or lead to high inflation, we estimate that a 108 percent of GDP increase in the federal debt would shrink the size of the economy by roughly 5 percent in 2030 – the equivalent of a $4,500 reduction in per-person income – and far more in the following years.\" The CFRB report also points out lawmakers could combine several of the above-listed options to reduce the impact any one option might have. As an example for one way a bill could get to $30 trillion in revenue over 10 years, the report suggests, \"a 16 percent employer-side payroll tax with a public premium averaging $8,000 per household ($3,000 per person), $5 trillion of taxes on high earners and corporations, and $1 trillion of spending cuts.\" The report also acknowledges the best way to finance \"Medicare-for-all\" might be to make the plan less ambitious than progressive leaders like Sanders and Warren have proposed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"While the financing options above are quite large in magnitude, they could be reduced significantly by reducing the cost of 'Medicare-for-All' itself,\" the report says. \"These cost reductions could be achieved in part by reforming or reducing provider payments, improving care coordination, and identifying policies to reduce excessive utilization of care.\" Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

The ship sank on March 21, 1760, off the Sogne archipelago, and was found on March 10, 2019. Divers in Norway have discovered the wreck of an 18th-century Dutch merchant ship that has eluded searchers for decades. Members of the Sogne Diving Club in southern Norway found the undisturbed wreck of the Juffrau Elisabeth, according to a statement released by Norway’s Directorate for Cultural Heritage on Oct. 25. \"This discovery is important because no one has been robbing this wreck for items,\" Karl Klungland, head of the Sogne Diving Club told Fox News, via email, noting that the ship's artifacts are still on the seabed. 360-YEAR-OLD SHIPWRECK REVEALED USING VIRTUAL REALITY The diving club hopes that some objects can be recovered from the wreck site and exhibited in a local museum. \"We are also hoping that remaining objects can be kept at sea bottom so that other divers can get the same feeling as we got when we discovered this untouched wreck,\" Klungland added. A composite image of the wreck site generated from several thousand photos of the Juffrau Elisabeth wreck. taken by Karl Klungland. (Karl Klungland/Sjøfartsmuseet) The ship sank on March 21, 1760, off the Sogne archipelago. “The vessel sank under dubious circumstances and the Dutch Captain Pitter Eelkesh later received criticism during the inquiry,” said Norway’s Directorate for Cultural Heritage in the statement. With all of her sails up, Juffrau Elisabeth struck several skerries, or small rocky islands, according to the Directorate. “The recent discovery is significant, and it will be an incredible source of information for scientists,” it added. “There are very few preserved shipwrecks from this period in Norway.” HISTORIC 17TH-CENTURY DUTCH SHIPWRECK DISCOVERED NEAR SOUTH AFRICAN BEACH Hanna Geiran, director general of the directorate, described the discovery as an “incredible find” in the statement. The Directorate said that Sogne Diving Club will receive “a record-breaking finder’s reward” for discovering the shipwreck. NRK reports that the Sogne Diving Club has been searching for the wreck of the Juffrau Elisabeth for 40 years. The wreck was found on March 10, 2019, according to NRK. 'PIRATE SHIP' HAND GRENADE DISCOVERED NEAR 17TH-CENTURY WRECK SITE Klungland told Fox News that the diving club was founded in 1979. Divers who subsequently became members of the club were already searching for the wreck at that time, he explained. The Norwegian Maritime Museum will now document the wreck site. Photogrammetry will be used to create a 3D-model of the wreck and an underwater drone will take photos of the wreck. Some artifacts will also be retrieved from the ship’s final resting place, according to officials. In a separate project, experts have harnessed virtual reality to create a stunning virtual dive of a 17th-century shipwreck.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com As the debate rages on whether Pluto, currently a dwarf planet, should be given back its planet status, it may soon be joined by an asteroid that could wind up being the smallest dwarf planet in the solar system. Asteroid Hygiea, the fourth largest space rock in the Asteroid Belt, was observed for the first time by astronomers in high-resolution. It's spherical in shape and may wind up taking the crown for the smallest dwarf from Ceres, also located in the Asteroid Belt. “Thanks to the unique capability of the SPHERE instrument on the [Very Large Telescope], which is one of the most powerful imaging systems in the world, we could resolve Hygiea’s shape, which turns out to be nearly spherical,” said the study's lead author, Pierre Vernazza, in a statement. “Thanks to these images, Hygiea may be reclassified as a dwarf planet, so far the smallest in the Solar System.” A new SPHERE/VLT image of Hygiea, which could be the Solar System’s smallest dwarf planet yet. As an object in the main asteroid belt, Hygiea satisfies right away three of the four requirements to be classified as a dwarf planet: it orbits around the Sun, it is not a moon and, unlike a planet, it has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. The final requirement is that it has enough mass that its own gravity pulls it into a roughly spherical shape. This is what VLT observations have now revealed about Hygiea. (Credit: ESO/P. Vernazza et al./MISTRAL algorithm (ONERA/CNRS) PLUTO SHOULD BE A PLANET AGAIN, RESEARCHERS ARGUE \"By comparing Hygiea’s sphericity with that of other Solar System objects, it appears that Hygiea is nearly as spherical as Ceres, opening up the possibility for this object to be reclassified as a dwarf planet,\" the study's abstract states. In addition to the spherical requirement for dwarf planet status, Hygiea already orbits the Sun, is not a moon, and has \"not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit,\" the ESO added in its statement. The research has been published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy. Though Hygiea may eventually be given dwarf planet status, it's significantly smaller than Pluto or Ceres, with a diameter of just 267 miles. Pluto's diameter is approximately 1,490 miles, while Ceres' diameter is approximately 590 miles. Following the discovery, the International Astronomical Union will eventually vote to determine whether Hygiea can be given dwarf planet status or if it will remain an asteroid.

The galaxies have to collide at just the right orientation so that they interact to create the ring, and before long they will have merged completely, hiding their messy past.\" The ESA added that the side-by-side juxtaposition of the two central bulges of the stars is unusual. Given that they're approximately the same size, it's like that the galaxies were also the same size prior to the crash. \"This is different from the more common collisions in which small galaxies are gobbled up by their larger neighbors,\" the ESA said. It's believed that the ring will last for approximately 100 million years, to be followed by the galaxies merging with one another in 1 to 2 billion years, the Daily Mail reported.

You don't see this every day. Or maybe ever. A giant great white shark gave shark-diving tourists a rare treat when it was spotted swimming upside down off the coast of South Australia. Diving company Calypso Star Charters posted the video to its Facebook page, noting this was the first time this type of incident had ever been seen in the area. \"We do not see them do this very often at all. In fact, it was the first time Capt. Dave had seen it himself!\" the company wrote in the Oct. 3 post. MASSIVE, 17-FOOT GREAT WHITE SHARK BITES DIVING CAGE: 'THE THRILL OF A LIFETIME' A Calypso Star Charters spokesman told Fox News they were not sure what caused the shark to swim on its back like that. \"It swam on its back for several seconds as depicted in the video but the shark was in the vicinity of our dive cage for a couple of hours much to the delight of our guests,\" the spokesman said in a Facebook interview. The spokesman added that the female shark was not tagged and it was approximately 12 feet long, or 3.5 meters. The footage was taken by one of the tour's customers, Wendy Bower-Leech. Despite similarities, the shark in the video is not experiencing tonic immobility, a \"trance-like state\" where the shark is turned on its back and disoriented, akin to human hypnosis, according to Shark Trust. The incredible video comes just days after another great white, a 17-foot behemoth named Bullet, was captured on film biting and shaking a shark-diving cage off the coast of Mexico.

    "articleText": "(Credit: Shutterstock) Wormholes, passageways that connect one universe or time to another, are still only theoretical — but that doesn't mean physicists aren't looking for them. In a new study, researchers describe how to find wormholes in the folds of our galaxy. These hypothetical passageways, created by folding a region of space like a piece of paper, are predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. But they require extreme gravitational conditions, such as those around supermassive black holes. In the new study, two researchers came up with a method to search for wormholes close to home, around the Milky Way's central, supermassive black hole, called Sagittarius A*. If a wormhole were to exist around Sagittarius A*, the stars on one side of the passage would be influenced by the gravity of stars on the other side, the researchers said Related: 5 Reasons We May Live in a Multiverse If physicists can detect small changes in the expected orbits of stars, such as a star called S2 that orbits Sagittarius A*, it may indicate that a wormhole is close by, the researchers said in a statement. Current methods aren't sensitive enough to see the slight changes in orbit that would be caused by a star at the other end of the wormhole, but new techniques and longer observations might render it possible within the next couple of decades, study co-author Dejan Stojkovic, a cosmologist and professor of physics at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, said in the statement. Yet even finding these slight changes in orbit wouldn't prove that a wormhole is nearby, he added. \"When we reach the precision needed in our observations, we may be able to say that a wormhole is the most likely explanation if we detect perturbations in the orbit of S2,\" Stojkovic said. \"But we cannot say that, 'Yes, this is definitely a wormhole.'\" That is because other unknown celestial objects on our side of the wormhole can also be exerting a gravitational pull and causing the changes. But not everyone's convinced. The star's altered trajectory due to a wormhole is \"unobservable irrespective of how accurate the measurements are,\" Serguei Krasnikov, a physicist at the Central Astronomical Observatory at Pulkovo in Russia, who was not involved with the research, wrote in a commentary published in the preprint server arXiv. That's because, even with more-precise measurements, astronomers can only measure the total acceleration of a star, not the additional acceleration caused by the gravitational influence of a star on the other end of a wormhole, he wrote. And even if a wormhole were ever found, it might not be open for voyage. People and spaceships probably won't be able to pass through a wormhole, because \"realistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don't know how to do that,\" Stojkovic said. \"To create a huge wormhole that's stable, you need some magic.\" The paper assumes that a stable wormhole can exist, which is not supported by General Relativity, said Jolyon Bloomfield, a lecturer in the department of physics at MIT, who was also not part of the study. \"I'm not convinced that the setup is valid, and hence do not trust the results that follow.\" If there is any deviation in observed acceleration of stars around Sagittarius A*, it’s “significantly more likely that a modification to General Relativity is being observed, rather than the effects of a wormhole,” he told Live Science.

Now we can start reaping the fruits of more than 10 years of work,” added Predehl. Another eROSITA image of the A3391/3395 system of clusters of galaxies shows the different processes that lead to the formation of so-called gigantic structures in the universe, according to scientists. The clusters, which look like large nebulae in the images, actually span tens of millions of light-years across, and contain thousands of galaxies each.

Ghirardini (MPE), MPE/IKI) GET THE FOX NEWS APP “X-rays give us a unique view of the Universe, hidden in visible light,” said Kirpal Nandra, director of high-energy astrophysics at MPE. “Looking at an apparently normal star, in X-rays we might see an orbiting white dwarf or neutron star in the process of devouring its companion. Visible light shows the structure of a galaxy traced by its stars, but the X-rays are dominated by supermassive black holes growing at their centers.\" Nandra continued: \"And where we see clusters of galaxies with optical telescopes, X-rays reveal the huge reservoirs of gas filling the space between them and tracing out the dark matter structure of the Universe. With its performance demonstrated, we now know that eROSITA will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the evolution of the energetic Universe.\" The eROSITA was launched on July 13 as part of the Russian-German Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space mission and has now entered its target orbit 100 days after launch.",

(KWCH/NNS) That would be the third grille he’s had on the truck because this isn’t the first animal he’s run into, just the smallest. The other two were damaged by deer.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com An Illinois couple who got married in Northern California's Sonoma County on Saturday — with a massive wildfire raging nearby — posed for a dramatic wedding portrait wearing masks. Wedding photographer Karna Roa captured the photo of the bride and groom, who got married at the Chateau St. Jean Winery in Kenwood, Calif., on Saturday, as the Kincade Fire burned just miles away.

An Illinois couple got married in Northern California's famous Sonoma County on Saturday as a massive wildfire raged nearby, posing for a dramatic wedding photo as they wore masks, the photographer told Fox News. (Karna Roa/KMR Photography) Roa told Fox News she did have some reservations showing up to the Chateau St. Jean vineyard in Sonoma County to photograph the wedding on Saturday, given the situation. “The whole area, of course, was super smoky,” she said. “I would love to say this is the first time it has happened, but this is the third year in a row in October that wine country has experienced this.” She said the couple, Katie and Curtis Ferland, from Chicago, are currently on their honeymoon, and not immediately available for an interview. THOUSANDS ORDERED TO EVACUATE AS WILDFIRES THREATEN LOS ANGELES-AREA NEIGHBORHOODS Curtis Ferland told WLS-TV in an earlier interview that he thought the wedding would need to be canceled after learning of the widespread wildfires. \"The first thing we see on TV when we turn it on is flames everywhere,\" he said. After arriving on the West Coast for their wedding, Katie and Curtis reportedly had to move to a hotel when their Airbnb rental lost power. The two were also forced to move the location of their rehearsal dinner because of the fire. WLS-TV reported that most of their vendors and staff were forced to evacuate on Saturday, but the ceremony still took place. Sara Sugrue, the wedding planner, had to redesign the entire event the night before the nuptials, according to the news outlet. \"We actually worked off a skeleton crew to make this happen,\" she said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Roa told Fox News it was the wedding planner who suggested the now-viral photo of Katie and Curtis in their masks. “Because of all of the changes in the plans and all of the stress leading up to the wedding, the wedding planner suggested that they do at least one image with the masks on,” Roa told Fox News, adding that the masks were available to everyone who attended the wedding, but the guests were only outside for 20 minutes because of the smoke. “When the couple put on the masks and it came time for this photo, I immediately thought of the American Gothic painting from 1930 and how that painting represented the normal for America of the time period,\" Roa said. \"All of a sudden this moment represented the new normal for wine country in October.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After their wedding, early on Sunday morning, the Ferlands and all of their guests were reportedly forced to evacuate.

    "description": "It's a forgettable car.",
    "articleText": "close Video 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 test drive The 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 is no one-trick pony. The most powerful Ford ever is as happy on a twisty track as it is on a drag strip, Fox News Automotive Editor Gary Gastelu says. The 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 is a forgettable car. (Ford) That is to say, it takes about 10 seconds of driving it on a racetrack to nearly forget you’re in a Mustang. Not a drag strip, mind you, but a twisty road course. In this case, the one outside of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway’s NASCAR oval, where Ford debuted the all-new GT500. The way it accelerates, turns and stops is uncannily effortless for a model that has traditionally been a burly bruiser. That’s what previous GT500s were, going back to the 1967 original. Driving one, even the latest 2013-2014 edition, made you feel like Wile E. Coyote with an Acme rocket strapped to the roof. With a 760 hp supercharged 5.2-liter V8 nicknamed the Predator under the hood, the new GT500 has more power than any that’s come before it, but harnesses with technology that seems alien to the Mustang. The Predator is based on the Voodo engine used by the Shelby GT350. It features a stronger block, trades the Voodo's flat-plane crank for a cross-plane crank and has a 2.65-liter supercharger strapped to the top of it. (Ford) At its starting price of $73,995, the GT500 is equipped with foot-wide Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 4S tires, computer-controlled MagneRide shock absorbers that can adjust their stiffness 1,000 times per second and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission that changes gears in eight-hundredths of one. Some will no doubt bemoan the lack of a stick-shift, but Ford doesn’t have one potent enough to handle the engine’s 625 lb-ft of torque and also wanted the GT500’s performance to be as accessible as possible, so the robots won. Left to its own devices, the GT500 is capable of accelerating to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds and covering a quarter-mile in 10.7 seconds on its best day, according to Ford. Both figures are .1 seconds quicker than its rival, the bigger, heavier 797 hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye can manage. It retains the Mustang’s line-lock feature that holds the car in place as you do a burnout to warm up the tires and a launch control system that makes it easy to get going and send the engine screaming to its 7,500 rpm redline between shifts. (Ford) Hit the brakes and the GT500’s 16.5-inch front and 14.5-inch rear discs stop it as if you’ve dropped an anchor equal to its 4,200 or so pounds, which is a couple of hundred more than any other Mustang. This sort of straight-line performance is great and all that, but the twist is how the GT500 handles the turns. The car has more vents in it than a building in spy movie, but they’re not just for cooling its monster motor and brakes. They also channel air through the body to reduce lift at speed. A $1,500 handling pack adds a set of aerodynamic whiskers to the front corners of the car and a Gurney flap on top of the rear spoiler to turn more of the air passing by them into downforce, while an $18,500 Carbon Fiber Track Pack cranks up the effect. (Ford) It completely swaps the rear spoiler for a giant wing designed after the one on the Ford Mustang GT4 racing car that helps the GT500 generate 550 pounds of downforce at its electronically restricted 180 mph top speed. Stickier summer-only Pilot Cup Sport 2 tires on lightweight carbon fiber wheels, deep Recaro front buckets and a rear seat delete that turns the GT500 into a two-passenger coupe are also included. With this arsenal in place, the GT500 goes around curves as if it’s swinging at the end of a string. The grip and poise are uncanny. The faster you drive, the smaller and more nimble it feels. You find yourself attacking long sweepers and esses without a second thought, the way you would in something that started its life as a high-end sports car, not a $28,000 pony. When it does reach the limit, it leaves plenty of room for error as you reel it back in. (Ford) Much of the credit goes to an advanced traction and stability management system that allows you to floor the accelerator with much abandon and figures out how much power you really need in any situation. I didn’t try shutting it off, because I’m exactly the kind of mediocre, middle-age lowest common denominator driver the engineers were looking to keep safe when they programmed it, but the ones I spoke with said it’s faster if you don’t, anyway. While many owners will no doubt tow their GT500s to the track with an F-Series truck Ford is happy to sell them on the side, I don’t think they’d mind driving it there much at all. The steamroller tires add some noise, but the firm ride is perfectly acceptable on the road. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That said, be sure to plan for a few extra stops for gas. The GT500’s fuel economy is a pretty dismal 12 mpg city and 18 mpg highway, while the Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye manages 13 mpg and 22 mpg, the latter thanks in part to a higher top gear ratio. But there’s a different kind of fluid on the options list that will make your gas bill look cheap. Along with the regular $1,000 decals, Ford is offering a limited number of GT500 with hand-painted racing stripes for $10,000. They don’t make the car any faster, but they may be worth their weight in gold if you send it across the auction block someday. I’m sure you’ll always remember it fondly if you do. ---------- 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Base price: $73,995 Type: 4- or 2- passenger, 2-door rear-wheel-drive coupe Engine: 5.2-liter supercharged V8 Power: 760 hp, 625 lb-ft torque Transmission: 7-speed automatic MPG: 12 city/18 hwy",

    "description": "As Californians on Tuesday are forced to once again confront the dual threats of wildfires and blackouts, the apparent new normal of having a utility switch off power in hopes of preventing forceful winds from sparking fires is proving to be too much for some residents.",
    "articleText": "close Video Blackouts and wildfires have Calif. residents drawing up moving plans Dealing with flames and forced blackouts appears the be the new normal for several homeowners in California. Many are faced with living in the dark for long periods of time or evacuations. As Californians on Tuesday were forced to once again confront the dual threats of wildfires and forced blackouts, the apparent new normal is proving to be too much for some residents. The nation's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Corp., will turn off the power for a third time this year to prevent powerful winds from damaging its equipment, which can lead to a blaze igniting. Up to 605,000 customers -- about 1.5 million people -- in 29 Northern California counties will be affected by this latest round of power cuts starting Tuesday. That means people who had the power go out Saturday and were still just getting the lights back on Monday are now faced with the prospect of being in the dark again for several days. The power cuts come as fire crews continue to battle the Kincade Fire in the state's wine country, a blaze that's destroyed 57 homes and damaged another dozen, with 90,000 homes and other buildings considered threatened. About 156,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, while others have taken to shelters due to the power outages.

How am I going to replace it?\" George Wiget, who evacuated his home in Bodega Bay, Calif. due to wildfire risk and power outages, said he would leave California \"tomorrow\" if he had enough money to do so. (KTVU) Another resident of Petaluma, Scotty Richardson, told the Associated Press he was \"furious, furious\" over the idea more outages, and the ongoing outages \"can't be the new normal.\" \"PG&E can't figure out how to deliver power reliably without killing people,\" Richardson said. \"This is more than three strikes — it's a failure of epic proportions.\" A Lafayette police officer stops traffic for a schoolboy at an intersection that has lost power Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in Lafayette, Calif.

Power lines owned by PG&E may have started two wildfires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area, even though widespread blackouts were in place to prevent downed lines from sparking in dangerous winds. The utility told state regulators on Monday the fires matched blazes that destroyed a tennis club and forced evacuations in Lafayette, about 20 miles east of San Francisco. The fires began in locations where power was kept on because they were not designed as high risk. \"They don't seem to know what the hell they're doing,\" Chris Sherman told the AP about PG&E while at a shelter in Santa Rosa. \"I'm not sure that they're really protecting anything.\" New video from the ground shows obstacles facing firefighters in California As the Kindcade Fire swells to twice the size of San Francisco, new video from the ground shows the flames on the frontlines; Claudia Cowan reports from the scene. The California Public Utilities Commission said Monday it was planning to open a formal investigation into the Public Safety Power Shutoffs within the next month. If regulators find that rules were broken, they can impose fines up to $100,000 per violation per day. “The state cannot continue to experience PSPS events on the scope and scale Californians have experienced this month, nor should Californians be subject to the poor execution that PG&E in particular has exhibited,” said CPUC President Marybel Batjer said in a statement. TOM DEL BECCARO: CALIFORNIA, PG&E, WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND In addition to the probe, the commission also plans to review the rules governing blackouts, will look to prevent utilities from charging customers when the power is off and will convene experts to find grid improvements that might lessen blackouts during next year's fire season.

This is a drive straight into hell. A harrowing video emerged Tuesday showing what firefighters are dealing with as they battle the largest wildfire currently burning in California, one that's menacing the state's wine country and threatening to explode with the return of powerful winds. The Kincade Fire, which began late Wednesday near Geyserville, Calif., had grown to 74,324 acres by Monday evening and was only 15 percent contained, according to Cal Fire. The blaze has so far destroyed 123 structures, 57 of which are residential homes. About 90,000 structures remain threatened by the fire, according to Cal Fire Division Chief Jonathan Cox. \"We’re playing both offense and defense right now on two different sides of the fire, and we’re going to have to flip-flop that tomorrow when that wind event comes through,” Cox said at a Monday night news conference.

    "articleText": "Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your Tuesday ... National Security Council official to testify that he was 'concerned' after listening to Ukraine phone call, alerted counsel As part of the House's formal impeachment inquiry, a top official at the National Security Council is expected to testify Tuesday that he listened to the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Situation Room, and reported his concerns to the NSC’s lead counsel. Video In prepared remarks obtained by Fox News, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a director of national security affairs, wrote: “I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine.” He added, “Following the call, I... reported my concerns to NSC’s lead counsel,” a reference to top NSC lawyer John A. Eisenberg. Video The Democrats’ inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during the July phone call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld. The White House and the president’s allies have maintained there was no such quid pro quo. Meanwhile, more questions are emerging about Hunter Biden’s business dealings. Click here for more on our top story. Video Republicans hit back at House Dems for announcing impeachment inquiry vote: 'like un-ringing a bell' Vindman's testimony comes as House lawmakers are preparing a vote on formal impeachment inquiry later this week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday the House will vote on a resolution to formalize -- and establish the parameters -- of the Trump impeachment inquiry. In a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution \"affirms the ongoing, existing investigation,\" \"establishes the procedure\" for future investigative steps and to potentially prevent the Trump administration from withholding documents and preventing witnesses from testifying. Fox News has learned the vote will take place Thursday on the House floor. It is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a resolution that sets process ground rules. Video Republicans hit back Monday at Pelosi over the planned vote, with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would play a role in a Senate impeachment trial -- saying, “A vote now is a bit like un-ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President Trump for weeks.\" Video Al-Baghdadi informant was inside compound at time of raid, Kurdish general tells Fox News The U.S. raid that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was months in the making and involved significant intelligence from Kurdish allies in Syria – including a rare informant at the heart of ISIS who was in the compound at the time of the raid, Fox News has learned. Video Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander, told Fox News how they tracked al-Baghdadi after the caliphate fell. The general said the informant “told us that he moved west to Idlib, and to a specific house. We told American intelligence on May 15, and together set up a secret cell, which had three Americans in it.” The SDF informant told them about the tunnels under the compound, how many people were with al-Baghdadi, and that he was planning to move, having been at that location for months.

Many housekeepers and gardeners who work at multimillion-dollar homes in some of Los Angeles' most upscale neighborhoods arrived to work Monday despite mandatory evacuation orders over fires threatening the area because they were either unaware of the situation or simply needed the day's pay, a report said. STRONG WINDS INCREASE SIZE OF KINCADE FIRE A report in the Los Angeles Times said that these workers could still be seen on the streets in Brentwood and other affluent areas that had been evacuated hours earlier. STEPMAN: BLACKOUTS A SELF-INFLICTED MESS \"If they say I have to evacuate, I will,\" Chon Ortiz, 50, who was cutting grass, told the paper in Spanish. \"But I need the work.\" Video The reporter spoke to several workers who babysit, perform housecleaning duties and general yard work in the neighborhood that is home to some of Hollywood's biggest names. One woman who showed up for work told the paper she met the family she works for as they were leaving the house. They told her they wouldn’t be using her that day and handed her a mask. The early morning scene in the area was chaotic, and no doubt, many families who employ these workers simply forgot to tell them about the evacuations due to the traumatic conditions. At least eight homes were destroyed and six damaged in the LA-area blaze, fire officials said. Some of the recognizable names driven from their homes included LeBron James and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Others who own homes in the evacuation zone include Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat running for president, who was not home at the time; Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger; and rapper and producer Dr. Dre. David Boyle, 78, awoke at 3 a.m. to his doorbell ringing and police officers pounding on the front door. They warned him the wildfire was advancing toward his house near the Getty complex. GET THE FOX NEWS APP “They said, ‘You need to evacuate.’ I’m like, ‘When?’ They said, ‘Now,’” Doyle said.

Strengthening and shifting winds on Tuesday are expected to reenergize the Kincade Fire, placing red flag weather warnings into effect for most of the San Francisco Bay Area as northern California’s sweeping wine country battles what’s now the state's largest fire this year. The fire, which began late Wednesday near Geyserville, Calif., has surged through Sonoma County, forcing about 185,000 people to evacuate their homes, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. JARRETT STEPMAN: CALIFORNIA BLACKOUTS ARE A SELF-INFLICTED MESS – DON'T JUST BLAME PG&E FOR THE NEW DARK AGES As of Monday, about 115 square miles had been scorched and 123 structures, including 57 houses and the historic Soda Rock Winery whose stone facade dates to 1869, had been destroyed, the Sacramento Bee reported. New evacuation orders were put in place for a portion of Lake County as the fire was expected to move eastward. “We are fully capable and ready to respond to all of the state’s fire emergencies plus going through this part of the season,” Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said, according to The Bee. “I want you to feel very confident that the fire service system and emergency response system is ready for California’s emergencies going into the rest of this fire season.” Firefighters braced for high winds to return by Tuesday, with gusts expected to reach 60 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Officials said the fire was about 15 percent contained as of Monday evening, an improvement from just 5 percent containment earlier in the day. Winds in the region briefly died down Monday, allowing firefighters to catch up to the blaze. “We’re playing both offense and defense right now on two different sides of the fire, and we’re going to have to flip-flop that tomorrow when that wind event comes through,” Cal Fire Division Chief Jonathan Cox said at a Monday night news conference. The windstorm prompted officials to issue “red flag” warnings for “critical” fire weather in most of the Bay area from early Tuesday until Wednesday afternoon as the blaze may spread rapidly and become more difficult to control. The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office on Monday permitted residents in two evacuation zones west of the metropolitan hub of Santa Rosa along the Pacific Coast to return home but warned they may need to leave again should conditions worsen, the Post reported. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Monday issued a state of emergency as several wildfires blazed across the state, including the Getty Fire near Los Angles. Pacific Gas & Electric company on Monday made the decision to cut power for about 600,000 northern and central California customers amid high wind conditions, The Bee reported. The power utility company implemented a historically large blackout over the weekend on nearly 1 million customers, prompting criticism from officials who questioned what Newsom was doing to ensure veterans hospitals and other facilities could remain in operation. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM Speaking at a news conference at the Sonoma County fairground Monday evening, Newsom said PG&E had to “get their act together,” as widespread blackouts could not be the new normal in its approach to high wind wildfire conditions. He added a major investigation by the public utilities commission would assess the company's protocol.",

(AP) “It has become necessary for us to make a great shock to fix the crisis,” Hariri said. “Our responsibility today is how we protect Lebanon and revive its economy.” The move comes only hours after a mob of supporters from the Hezbollah party attacked anti-government protest camps in the country’s capital of Beirut. THOUSANDS OF LEBANON DEMONSTRATORS KEEP PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENT Lebanese riot policemen separates between anti-government protesters, left, and Hezbollah supporters, right during a protest in Beirut, Lebanon, Thursday, Oct. 24, 2019. (AP) What began on Oct. 17 as a fight over a tax on Whatsapp calls has now erupted into “a war scene,” according to a local TV presenter. The predominately non-violent demonstrations were disrupted by the Shia-Islamist group who are upset that their country is being paralyzed politically and economically. Soldiers and riot police have been trying to separate the two groups using non-deadly force, but have been unsuccessful. Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, stated Friday that the roads around Beirut's center should be reopened and hinted that the protestors were being funded by foreign enemies attempting to infiltrate their agendas. “Someone is trying to pull it… toward a civil war,” Nasrallah said Friday about the country’s uprisings. A riot police officer, center right, stops other policemen from beating a protester who lies on the ground, after clashes erupted between an anti-government protesters and Hezbollah supporters near the government palace, in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019. (AP) Hezbollah, the country’s most powerful armed group, backs a majority of the Lebanese government since its formation following the 1975-1990 civil war. They are represented by Parliament Speaker and Shia Muslim Nabih Berri, who traditionally splits up political leadership equally with a prime minister representing Sunni Muslims and a president representing Maronite Christians.

Before the U.S. military positively identified the headless body of the world’s most wanted terrorist killed in a daring raid, a Kurdish spy slipped into Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s compound and stole his underwear to confirm the long-sought ISIS leader's identity through DNA, a Kurdish official said. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) senior adviser Polat Can said Monday that the Kurdish-led force’s own sources tracked al-Baghdadi to Idlib, Syria, before beginning to work with the CIA to keep tabs on the terror leader. He said al-Baghdadi was known to move often and was soon expected to change locations. HOW ISIS LEADER AL-BAGHDADI'S HEADLESS BODY WAS ID'D MINUTES AFTER DEATH Before al-Baghdadi could move, a Kurdish undercover operative was able to reach him and retrieve the self-styled “Caliph’s” underwear, Can said. Through a DNA test, he said they were able to confirm “100%” that the person of interest was al-Baghdadi. “All intelligence and access to Al Baghdadi as well as the identification of his place, were the result of our own work,” Can wrote. “Our intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute.” AL-BAGHDADI INFORMANT WAS INSIDE COMPOUND AT TIME OF RAID, KURDISH GENERAL TELLS FOX NEWS In announcing al-Baghdadi’s death, President Trump had said the Kurds provided “helpful” information but didn’t provide “a military role at all.” Video While U.S. officials have not confirmed Can’s account, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF commander, had told Fox News on Monday that the Kurdish force had an informant inside the compound at the time of the raid. The agent had told them about the tunnels under the compound, how many people were with al-Baghdadi and about his planned move. Al-Baghdadi was killed after he fled down a dead-end tunnel with three children – where he was found \"whimpering\" and trapped – and detonated a suicide vest. WHO'S LEADING ISIS NOW THAT AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD? Al-Baghdadi’s head remained intact following the blast, allowing commandos to use biometrics, specifically facial recognition, to immediately identify him. Trump said they had also brought along samples of al-Baghdadi’s DNA to verify his identity with an onsite test that produced positive results in only 15 minutes. People look at destroyed houses near the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, Sunday, after an operation by the U.S. military which targeted Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, (AP) It was unclear what kind of devices were used to positively identify al-Baghdadi, but over the past several years the military has been developing technology for portable DNA labs that process results quickly. The technicians were able to take “substantial pieces” of al-Baghdadi’s remains from the site, Trump said. AL-BAGHDADI KILL: HOW THE DARING MILITARY OPERATION WENT DOWN On Monday, Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that al-Baghdadi’s remains were “disposed of appropriately” in accordance with the law of armed conflict, but didn’t elaborate. A source has told Fox News he was buried at sea, similar to Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden, who was killed in 2011. While it remains unclear who exactly will take over the terror organization, Trump confirmed on Tuesday that al-Baghdadi's \"number one replacement\" was killed by American troops, without naming the target.

    "description": "Brits are facing the prospect of going to the polls just weeks before Christmas, after the opposition Labour Party announced Tuesday that it would back Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a December general election to break the country’s Brexit stalemate.",
    "articleText": "close Video UK Parliament passes Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, rejects fast-track timetable British lawmakers back Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit bill in principle but vote down his timetable, threatening October 31 deadline for U.K.'s exit from the European Union. Brits are facing the prospect of going to the polls just weeks before Christmas after the opposition Labour Party announced Tuesday that it would back Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a December general election to break the country’s Brexit stalemate. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced that the party would back the call for an early election since he said that the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union at the end of October without a formal withdrawal agreement was “off the table.” BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION TO BREAK BREXIT IMPASSE “The Labour Party loves debate, but they also love the end of the debate, and this is the end of the debate and we’re going out there to win,” he said, surrounded by supporters. Lawmakers will vote later Tuesday on the exact date of the election. Johnson has requested Dec. 12, but other opposition parties have suggested a few days earlier. Johnson has been calling for a general election for months after it became clear that, with no majority in the House of Commons, he faces an uphill climb to get his agenda through the chamber. His timetable to get his Brexit withdrawal agreement through Parliament was voted down last week. The next scheduled election is not until 2022. He appealed to Corbyn last week to \"end this nightmare and provide the country with a solution as soon as we reasonably can.\" \"If I win a majority in this election, we will ratify the great new deal that I have negotiated, get Brexit done in January and the country will move on,\" he wrote. BRITISH PARLIAMENT FINALLY APPROVES BORIS JOHNSON'S BREXIT BILL - BUT MOMENTS LATER VOTES DOWN THREE-DAY TIMETABLE But opposition parties had consistently opposed those calls for an early election, claiming that they would only do so once the chance of a “hard Brexit’ on Oct. 31 was ruled out and a number of votes for an early general election failed in Parliament. Conservatives have claimed that the opposition was instead due to the Tories’ commanding lead in the polls. Britain's main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks to lawmakers during an election debate in the House of Commons, London, Monday Oct. 28, 2019. (House of Commons via AP) But the Oct. 31 deadline was killed off last week after Johnson’s withdrawal agreement was rejected by Parliament, forcing him to request a further delay from E.U. leaders. That request was accepted by E.U. leaders, pushing the scheduled British departure off again until the end of January. Johnson has also promised not to put his withdrawal agreement again to Parliament before the election in an effort to win support for an early vote. Johnson’s Tories are ahead in the polls, with an Opinium Poll last week giving them a 16-point lead over Labour, but a number of factors could complicate that. One is the prospect that Brexiteers, unhappy with yet another delay to the implementation of the 2016 vote, could either stay at home or flock to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party -- splitting the pro-Brexit vote. At the same time, Labour face a similar challenge from the anti-Brexit and left-of-center Liberal Democrats. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Conservatives are likely also to be wary of believing in polls showing them ahead. In 2017, when Brits last went to the ballot box, many polls predicted they would be returned with a powerful majority. However the election produced a hung parliament, and then-Prime Minister Theresa May kept hold of power only by allying with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

Bob Maginnis on Turkey's deal with Russia: Erdogan is 'pushing the envelope' Turkey and Russia to conduct joint patrols in northern Syria; reaction and analysis from retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bob Maginnis. UNITED NATIONS – Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon on Monday accused Turkey of being a hub for regional terrorism while saying its recent incursion into Syria has resulted in the strengthening of the Islamic State terror network. Speaking during a United Nations Security Council debate on the Middle East, Danon said the council spent too much time on Israel and called on its members to do more to thwart the ambitions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \"Erdogan has turned Turkey into a safe haven for Hamas (terrorists) and a financial center for funneling money to subsidize terror attacks. Erdogan’s Turkey shows no moral or human restraint towards the Kurdish people. Erdogan has turned Turkey into a regional hub for terror,\" Danon said. The quarterly open debate often has been criticized over perceived one-sided attacks against the Jewish state. Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon lashed out at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in pointed remarks. (AP, File) Danon complained, “As Erdogan expands his terror campaign into Syria, the U.N. Security Council focuses on Israel. It is a disgrace to this body’s mandate that this Council continues to target Israel instead of the atrocities performed by Erdogan. Recycling old arguments over and over against Israel instead of focusing on the devastation caused by Erdogan, as we sit here today, will not save the lives of the Kurdish people.” He continued, “Israel warns against the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds, and calls upon the international community to take action and provide aid to the Kurdish people.” Danon added, “His violence in Syria also resulted in the strengthening of ISIS. While he was busy murdering those who have helped keep the world safe from the threat of ISIS, he allowed ISIS members to break out of prison and subject the world to future attacks.” Before the meeting, Danon would not say if Israel played an intelligence role in the mission to kill ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi this past Saturday, but he congratulated the Trump administration during his speech on the operation that saw the death of the terror leader. Video United States U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the council, “the world is a much safer place,” following the death of al-Baghdadi. She thanked “America’s fearless women and men in uniform, our intelligence community and our partners that executed this mission flawlessly, for their efforts in bringing the leader of ISIS to justice.” Craft focused the rest of her message on calling for more action against Hamas. She said the extremist group received less criticism than Israel and pointed out that its behavior had never been “seriously scrutinized by this council or the General Assembly.” She continued, “If this institution is genuinely concerned with peace, we should be eager to examine Hamas’ behavior more closely.” Video Last December, then-Ambassador Nikki Haley tried to persuade the General Assembly to condemn Hamas. Her efforts came close to success but were thwarted by a procedural move from the Kuwaitis and Bolivians which meant the U.S. resolution needed a two-thirds majority of votes. U.N. FAILS TO ADOPT U.S. RESOLUTION CONDEMNING HAMAS TERROR Turkey’s United Nations Ambassador Feridun Sinirlioglu responded to Danon’s earlier remarks aimed against his country and accused the Israeli government of having a “terrorist ideology.” He told the council, “Today, once again, we have listened to our daily dosage of lies. When these lies come from the representative of terror, they are just a waste of time.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Iran’s deputy ambassador, Eshagh Al Habib, followed his Turkish counterpart in condemning Israel, accusing it of waging wars in the region. He also called on the Security Council to implement its resolutions against Israel and blamed the U.S. for shielding her closest Mideast ally. Earlier in the day, Palestinian Ambassador to the U.N. Riyad Mansour shared a similar message. He called on the council and international community to take action against Israel if it continued to violate resolutions, saying Israel “must bear the consequences of its violations.” Mansour said they should include “sanctions and prosecution in courts.”",

NORTHERN SYRIA – The U.S. raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was months in the making and involved significant intelligence from Kurdish allies in Syria – including a rare informant at the heart of ISIS who was in the compound at the time of the raid, Fox News has learned. Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander, told Fox News how they tracked al-Baghdadi after the caliphate fell. The general said the informant “told us that he moved west to Idlib, and to a specific house. We told American intelligence on May 15, and together set up a secret cell, which had three Americans in it.” Video The SDF informant told them about the tunnels under the compound, how many people were with al-Baghdadi, and that he was planning to move, having been at that location for months. That’s when the U.S. carried out the attack at the compound Saturday, and brought out the informant safely. Informants within ISIS are extremely rare. To have one so close to the leader is unheard of, and a remarkable achievement for Kurdish forces. Mazloum said the raid could not have been possible without Kurdish intelligence. Video PICTURED: MILITARY DOG THAT HELPED U.S. FORCES TAKE DOWN AL-BAGHDADI Separately, a senior U.S. defense official described the SDF as a “key player” in the operation but noted the SDF and Kurds did not fly in with U.S. forces. The official said 11 children who were in the al-Baghdadi compound were “physically turned over to a trusted individual in the area.” Mazloum also talked about the aftermath of President Trump's recent decision to pull troops from northeastern Syria -- a move critics say left Kurds who'd faithfully helped the U.S. contain ISIS vulnerable to a Turkish invasion. “After the Americans pulled out, the Turks invaded, and we had no choice but to do a deal with the Syrian government and Russians. They were able to protect us. So, the Syrians moved to the border in place of the Americans.” Video Fox News saw this, along with numerous cease-fire violations at the northern Syria front on Sunday. Syrian government forces took up their positions right opposite Turkish forces, which were just over half a mile away. The Kurds said in the long run, they just couldn’t push back the Turkish Army themselves. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gun battles raged, and Turkish drone strikes and gunfire were regularly observed. Mazloum also opened up about the future in Syria, saying it wasn’t too late for the U.S. to come back and protect the Kurds. “Our relationship with President Trump depends on him fulfilling his promise of protecting us.” Fox News' Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com The family of 21-year-old British tourist Amelia Bambridge, who vanished after a beach party on a popular vacation island in Cambodia last week, arrived in the country Monday to join the search that so far has yet to uncover any leads in her disappearance. Bambridge vanished Wednesday night from a beach on Koh Rong island off the country’s southwestern coast. Her phone, money and credit cards were found in her bag on Police Beach the next morning. Her passport later turned up in her room at a hostel where she'd been staying. Nearly one week after her disappearance, about 150 people have joined the search, including divers, police, navy personnel and other volunteers, but nobody has announced any further signs of her. Bambridge's father has said he's losing hope that his daughter will be found alive. (Lucie Blackman Trust/Family via AP) MISSING VIRGINIA GIRL, 14, FEARED ABDUCTED BY MAN WITH 'SUICIDAL IDEATIONS,' POLICE SAY “We don't seem to be making any headway,” Bambridge’s brother, Harry, told the BBC. “We have got no leads to go off. I left my emotions on the plane. All I'm doing is concentrating on finding my sister.” Searchers have scoured the island’s jungle, where other missing tourists previously have been found safe, without results. One official, Koh Rong commune chief Chhoeun Chantha, told The Associated Press he suspected Bambridge may have drowned because her belongings turned up near the water’s edge on the beach. Harry has questioned the possibility of his sister drowning. “For me, something's not right,” he told the BBC. “We have had divers out searching the water. The water is shallow so the chances of her drowning are quite slim.” As many as 150 searchers have been looking for Bambridge on land and sea, checking hotels and guest houses on the island. (Sihanoukville province Authority Police via AP) Bambridge’s father, Phil, who lived in Vietnam teaching English, told the Guardian he didn’t think his daughter would be found alive as the search entered its third day. “I hope a miracle does happen, but I don’t think we’ll see her,” he said. Bambridge has not been seen since last Wednesday night when she went to a beach party on Koh Rong island in southwestern Cambodia. (Sihanoukville Province Authority Police via AP) CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Her family said her trip to Asia began on Sept. 27, when she flew to Vietnam. Her father told the outlet he advised her on safety precautions before she set off. Koh Rong, about 15 miles offshore in the Gulf of Thailand, covers an area of about 30 square miles.

    "articleText": "close Video Defense Secretary Mark Esper leads Pentagon briefing on raid that killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi U.S. forces assaulted al-Baghdadi's compound in Barisha, Syria and found the ISIS leader hiding in a tunnel where he detonated a suicide vest. Islamic State spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, considered a potential successor to terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also was killed in Syria in a separate attack by U.S. forces, a senior State Department official confirmed to Fox News on Monday. Al-Muhajir had been considered a “number two” to al-Baghdadi, according to the official. The second U.S. military operation took place in Turkish-held Jarabulus in northern Syria, a 3-hour drive from where al-Baghdadi was killed near another border town with Turkey, Fox News has learned. This file image made from a video posted on a militant website in April 2019 purportedly shows former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. (AP/Al-Furgan media) AL-BAGHDADI KILL: HOW THE DARING MILITARY OPERATION WENT DOWN Hours after U.S. Special Operations forces raided al-Baghdadi’s compound in northwestern Syria, the top Kurdish leader for the Syrian Democratic Forces, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, tweeted: “Following the previous ops, a senior assistent for al- Bagdadi is called Abu Hesen al Mouhjir was targeted in a village named Ein al Baat near Jaraboul city, the mission was conducted via direct coordination of SDF Intel & US military apart the ongiong ops to hunt ISIS leaders.” Al-Baghdadi was killed during Saturday night’s daring raid in Syria and after years of intelligence gathering, U.S. Special Operation Forces had no doubts the mutilated body of the man killed during that raid was the long-sought ISIS leader. U.S. Special Operation Forces employed new technology and DNA testing to positively identify al-Baghdadi's headless remains almost immediately. TRUMP DEFENDS KEEPING 'LEAKER' SCHIFF, PELOSI OUT OF THE LOOP ON AL-BAGHDADI RAID While the commandos had visually identified al-Baghdadi before he bolted down a dead-end tunnel with three children -- where he was found \"whimpering\" and trapped before detonating a suicide vest -- that wasn’t enough. Various accounts have told of his death in the past, only for him to surface yet again. “There wasn’t much left,” President Trump said of al-Baghdadi’s remains during a Sunday morning news conference following the raid, “but there are still substantial pieces that they brought back.” Al-Baghdadi’s head remained intact following the blast, allowing commandos to use biometrics, specifically facial recognition, to immediately identify him, Fox News National Correspondent Jennifer Griffin reported. Biometrics is a method of authenticating a person’s identification that uses human features such as fingerprints, facial recognition or other physical characteristics. WHO'S LEADING ISIS NOW THAT AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD? The U.S. military operation that killed the elusive ISIS leader also succeeded in decapitating the organizational structure of the international terror group facing a leadership vacuum in the latest of several major setbacks. While it remains unclear who exactly will take over the terror organization, President Trump said in March the caliphate was “obliterated” and the U.S. will “continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end.” The terror group has yet to officially name a successor. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The terror group already had lost vast stretches of its physical caliphate that stretched across parts of Syria and Iraq, but counterterrorism experts have cautioned they expect the group's ideology to endure beyond al-Baghdadi.
