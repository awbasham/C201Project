    "articleText": "…by Gordon Duff, Senior Editor A few days ago, Russia, Syria and the Kurdish Defense Forces came to an agreement to cooperate against Turkey. At a later date, Syria’s Kurds are to seek the best political deal they can get from Damascus. The situation is this, Turkey is not doing so well on the battlefield, their fake army of mercenaries and criminals are being slaughtered by extremely well-armed and well-trained Kurds (thanks USA!), while American troops fled Northern Syria leaving behind radios, dirty laundry, house pets and their dignity and honor. Two weeks into the fight, after telling the US that Pence can go to hell, Erdogan and Pence agree to allow the Kurds (and Syrian Arab Army) to withdraw so Turkey can move out its wounded, bury its dead, and tow away 3 dozen burned out hulks that used to be German-built Leopard tanks destroyed by latest version American TOW missiles, which the Kurds have by the thousands. Where is Turkey’s air force? Well, with Syria moving forward, BUK2 and Pantsir S1 units are deploying with the Syrian Arab Army with some forward deployment of longer range S300 systems. This, of course, leaves Damascus vulnerable to Israeli attack were it not for an agreement between Russia and Israel which is being tested as we speak. Where the farce is can be explained easily. The US ran away and now has no “standing”, as the US has no troops in the field. Syria has control of US areas, and Russians have moved forward to the line of contact in several areas containing Turkish advance where other forces are not yet deployed. In the last 72 hours, Syria now controls 20% more territory than before, the kind of “big win” only seen with Hitler’s blitzkrieg. Syria has its oil back, much of it, its water supplies and its agricultural centers, all lost to American and Kurdish control. Syria may not be stronger today, but a Syrian army backed by Kurds with a load is stronger still. Cover for Syrian Army movements against Turkey are Iranian forces. This is where things get difficult. Iran is close to Turkey, a major economic partner. Russia is close to Turkey, a major economic partner. Then we have the agreement itself, between the US, who has nobody left on the ground, and Turkey, who isn’t doing so well, a nation whose currency is worthless and whose economy, even without Donald Trump, is in freefall. Pence has agreed to award much of Northern Syria to Turkey, setting up a safe zone guaranteed by US troops that no longer exist and in consultation with no one actively fighting on the field. Erdogan says he is willing to let the Kurds withdraw, while Kurds are doing quite the opposite, moving forward to confront Turkey, aided by the Syrian Army which has an air force and extremely powerful mobile air defenses as well. OK, in a day, two days, Erdogan will meet with Putin and all this will be straightened out, or everyone hopes. Yet, Russia’s fake “zio-press,” and we mean RT and Sputnik, are spinning this as a great victory by Turkey against Russian-backed Syria? What we do know is that Putin and Lavrov will never allow a Turkish “safe zone” guaranteed by non-existent US forces inside Syria. It will NEVER happen. The Erdogan-Pence Treaty of 2019 will go down in history with the invention of brown toilet paper. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "title": "The Legal Lynching of a Truth-Seeker: Jim Fetzer’s Stalinist-Style Show Trial",
    "description": "This is bigger than Jim Fetzer and Sandy Hook. This is about saving the Bill of Rights...",
    "articleText": "Stalinist events featured rousing images. Jim Fetzer's trial featured a tear-jerking backdrop image of Noah Pozner By Kevin Barrett, Veterans Today Editor Tuesday was the final day of Jim Fetzer’ defense against Lenny Pozner’s libel lawsuit. I attended and wrote up a “just the facts” report that evening. At almost the same moment I published my report, the jury came back with a verdict awarding close to half a million dollars to Lenny “Jim Fetzer gave me PTSD” Pozner. Now it’s time for an opinion piece. And as much as I sympathize with Mr. Pozner, assuming his account is accurate, my opinion is that Jim Fetzer got a raw deal…and that the reverberations of this case will be disastrous unless it is overturned. The whole courtroom drama was carefully scripted and controlled to ensure that the jury, as well as onlookers and reporters, got to hear only one side of the story. Fetzer was never allowed to present his defense. Jim Fetzer’s defense is simple: Truth is an absolute defense against libel, and Fetzer published statements alleged by Posner to be libelous because he believed them to be true. What’s more, he still believes them to be true. Whether he is right I do not know. But I do know he is sincere in his beliefs. I watched Jim Fetzer take the stand, swear to tell “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth”—and then watched him silenced and admonished, and the jury hurriedly chased out of the room, when he tried to speak the truth as he saw it. Jim merely said he still believed his “libelous” statements were true. Asserting the contrary would be a lie. Not saying anything would be a lie by omission. So he was admonished and threatened by the court for the sin of not lying on the witness stand! As I understand it, at no point during the two phases of the trial was Jim Fetzer ever allowed to present to a jury the evidence that led him to believe that Sandy Hook was an Operation Gladio style psy-op (which those who have read Daniel Ganser’s NATO’s Secret Armies know is entirely plausible) and that there was no actual school shooting (which does seem farfetched, but stranger things have happened). How could he present a truth defense without showing the evidence that led him to believe his allegedly libelous statements were in fact truthful? According to the 7th Amendment of the Constitution: In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved… Yet as I understand it—and perhaps someone can correct me in the comments if I am wrong—Jim Fetzer was never given the right of trial by jury to determine whether he had or had not committed libel. Instead, an obviously biased judge presided over that crucial first phase of the case, denying Jim’s Constitutionally-guaranteed right to a trial by jury. The same judge prevented Jim from presenting his truth defense, which would have entailed giving Jim full scope to present the evidence that led him to believe his statements were truthful and therefore not libelous. It was only in the second, penalty phase of the trial that a jury was convened. And during that phase, not only was Jim prevented from presenting his truth defense to the jury, he was prohibited from even mentioning it, or from telling the truth about his beliefs. Meanwhile the Pozner team was allowed to engage in shameless emotional manipulation of the jury. They even projected a huge adorable picture of Noah Pozner on the screen as the backdrop to the crucial back-to-back testimony of Lenny Pozner and Jim Fetzer! (Jim Fetzer, of course, was not allowed to use the big screen to project images that raise questions about the official story of Sandy Hook—images that can be found in Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, but which were, along with all other evidence supporting Fetzer’s truth defense, in essence banned from the courtroom.) Chilling Effect? One of the most dangerous repercussions of Pozner-vs.-Fetzer is its potential chilling effect on free speech. The decision awarded more than half a million dollars in “damages” based on the premise that a book presenting an alternative interpretation of a historical event hurt someone’s feelings. There was no tangible connection between the “libelous” statements in the book and any actual damages—loss of income, medical bills, etc. It was all about emotions: “This tearjerking Hollywood-style courtroom spectacle has whipped us into tearful sympathy with Pozner and two minutes of hate for Fetzer. Let’s express our emotions with a damage award.” Following the court’s logic, if a German-American’s feelings are hurt by a book portraying Germans as villains in World War II, why not sue the author for libel and ban the book? Why not drag the author into court—and refuse to allow him to present the reasons he thinks his anti-German interpretation of World War II is truthful? Of course that would never happen, since popular prejudices are in sync with hatred of Germany’s mythic villainy; the court would find ways to rig the process to support the popular prejudice. So how about these more plausible examples: African-American plaintiffs sue publishers for hurting their feelings by publishing 19th-century texts that include libelous portrayals of blacks; the grandson of Lyndon Johnson sues authors who have hurt his feelings by arguing that LBJ participated in the JFK assassination coup; a father who lost a son in Iraq sues an antiwar author for hurting his feelings by asserting that the invasion of Iraq was a criminal war based on lies and that his dead son was a war criminal. One can imagine an almost infinite number of possible “libel” cases along these lines. And while only a few are likely to actually happen, that is a few too many—because the chilling effect of such lawsuits will terrorize authors and publishers into avoiding controversial or unpopular historiography. This is precisely what the Bill of Rights, whose purpose is to protect controversial and disturbing speech about matters of public import, is supposed to prevent. I have had my differences with Jim Fetzer on many issues, including Sandy Hook. Specifically, I think we should be very careful about asserting or insinuating “nobody died” theories about suspected false flag events, for reasons that should by now be obvious. But this is bigger than Jim Fetzer and Sandy Hook. This is about saving the Bill of Rights, which is under attack today as never before. Regardless of whether Jim is right or wrong about Sandy Hook, regardless of how mistaken some of his approaches may have been, the outcome of Pozner v. Fetzer presents a clear and present danger to freedom of expression in the United States. The process of Pozner v. Fetzer appears to have been rigged precisely for the purpose of engineering this controlled demolition of our Constitutional rights. It must be appealed and overturned.

So far there is no British public demand for an investigation of the investigation, something that screams out as being needed, as the government has demonstrated no earnest intention of even revealing what they do know, much less what they don’t know. As James O’Neill covers below, even the frozen coroner’s inquiry as to how Dawn Sturgess died from what was claimed to be Russian-supplied Novichok, with the now usual no evidence of such, is completely ignored. And as to why the Skripals have been kept under wraps, no official has attempted to give any reason whatsoever.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge Biographic Literaric 1817. The above quotation, now more than 200 years old, remains a perfect encapsulation of the ongoing farce (or tragedy) that is the case of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Mr Skripal was a Russian intelligence agent who betrayed his country. After serving part of his prison term he was released and moved to England where he lived in the small English city of Salisbury. His daughter Yulia, a Russian citizen and resident of Moscow, visited her father in Salisbury in March 2018. Whilst she was there, father and daughter became seriously ill while in the centre of town. They were found on a park bench and taken to hospital. They both recovered, and apart from a brief statement by Yulia some weeks later, neither has been heard from since. At the time of the incident, the then United Kingdom Prime Minister Therese May, made a series of unequivocal statements about the incident in which she blamed Russia as being the Government responsible for the Skripal’s illness. She further claimed that the agent used to disable the Skripals was a Russian developed agent she labeled “Novichok.” The Russian sounding name and its reputed origins were evidence, May claimed, that the Russian government was responsible for what happened to the Skripals. The United Kingdom government imposed sanctions on Russia. In this they were joined by a number of other countries, including Australia. As more information became available, the United Kingdom government’s version became less and less plausible. In fact, many of the allegations made by the United Kingdom government were downright absurd. It is sufficient to note here that the alleged agent used to protect the Skripals was a highly toxic substance where only minute quantities are required to cause an almost instant death. The Skripals were said to be infected at Sergei’s home. There has never been a satisfactory explanation of how the pair were infected, yet managed to survive several hours, during which time they travelled, fed ducks in the park, ate a meal, and walked through the city centre. The official version was beyond absurd. Facts however, did not seem to matter with a gullible media rushing to report the government’s absurdities, and a number of countries expelling Russian diplomats. The ordinary alleged Western principles of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after a proper legal process were simply abandoned in the anti-Russian hysteria that was generated. Quite why the Russian government would wish to assassinate a former spy whom they had released and allowed to depart Russia some years previously was never explained. Even less plausible was any motive as to why Russia would seek to kill Yulia while visiting her father. She was, as far as one can tell, a blameless Russian citizen living in Moscow and planning her forthcoming marriage. Logic, or the lack thereof, has never been regarded as an essential element in western propaganda. That the real reason for the propaganda barrage against Russia may have been to disrupt the then forthcoming World Cup football finals in that country looks increasingly likely. The tournament was in fact a huge success, including for the tens of thousands of British fans who traveled to Russia for the event. Shortly after the Skripals fell ill, the story was given extra legs by two British citizens falling ill from allegedly discovering a tainted (but unopened) bottle of perfume. That woman victim, Dawn Sturgess, later died. This gave rise to fresh anti-Russian hysteria in the British media and kept the story alive for a few more weeks. Since then, there has been a serious lack of interest by the western media. That two Russians, one a British resident, the other a Russian resident, should disappear off the face of the planet was apparently not of interest. The western press were equally silent on what was a blatant breach of international law, of the rights of the Russian government with regard to one of its citizens, or even the whereabouts or fate of two blameless (on the media’s own narrative) human beings. It is known that the British government issued at least one “D” Notice, a device to prevent the media from reporting facts relating to a specific incident. No explanation has been given for that D Notice, although it is know that the identity of the named person, which was suppressed, was a friend of Sergei’s and an active British spy. This association, and the details of this man’s activities, suggested that there was a broader agenda at play than an attempt to destroy the success of the World Cup finals. Again, the singularly incurious British media seem content to allow this blatant censorship of what is self evidently a material issue itself speaks volumes. Under British law, where there is a suspicious death, a Coroner’s Court hearing must be held. The death of Dawn Sturgess clearly fell within that definition. The first such hearing was held on 19 July 2018 and immediately adjourned. And the initial adjournment is not uncommon especially when Police inquiries are ongoing, as was the case here. Earlier this month (October 2019) however, the Coroners Court issued a public statement in which is announced that the inquest into Dawn Sturgess’ death had been adjourned indefinitely. This is an extraordinary development. It means in effect that the whole of the allegations made over the preceding 18 months, about the cause of death, the persons allegedly responsible, and all the political and propaganda barrage that went with it has now effectively being abandoned. The Coroner’s Court cannot establish to the requisite standard how Ms Sturgess died, much less the identity of any individual or government that might be responsible. As might be expected, the announcement by the British coroner has been met with a studied silence why the western media. The linking of Ms Sturgess’ death to the alleged activities of two Russian citizens seen in Salisbury on the day the Skripal’s became ill, and the lurid allegations about their alleged activities, have similarly collapsed. The whole sorry saga has been disclosed as the complete nonsense that critics of the official original British version, and that of their unquestioning allies such as Australia, always said that it would. The discovery of the stricken Skripals by the daughter of a woman who just happened to be the highest ranking British military nurse, and who just happened to be nearby, was another feature that singularly failed to interest the incurious media, content as ever to repeat British government propaganda. The other feature that has been allowed to disappear down the memory hole is the whereabouts of the Skripals. They have been neither seen nor heard from in more than 15 months. The British media and their equivalents elsewhere remain singularly incurious about this feature. It is proof yet again of the timeliness of Coleridge’s axiom about (in this case the media’s) singular lack of curiosity and willingness to suspend disbelief. Protestations about the “rule of law” are revealed yet again for the self-serving words that they are.

    "articleText": "BBC: Harry Dunn’s parents rejected a “bombshell” offer from Donald Trump to meet the woman accused of involvement in their son’s fatal crash. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said they felt “a little ambushed” when the president revealed Anne Sacoolas was in the next room at the White House. Mrs Sacoolas returned to the United States under diplomatic immunity days after the crash which killed Harry, 19. Harry’s parents said they wanted to meet Mrs Sacoolas, 42, in the UK. Mr Dunn said a White House official told them she would not be returning to the UK, but Mr Trump said he would “try to push this from a different angle”. Harry Dunn died on 27 August when his motorcycle crashed with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. ‘Not prepared’ Mrs Sacoolas – who is reportedly married to a US intelligence official stationed at the base – was interviewed by police but then returned to the United States after claiming diplomatic immunity. That status has since been cast into doubt by the Foreign Office and Mr Dunn’s family want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK. Loading... Speaking on CBS This Morning, Mr Dunn said the president had suggested the meeting with Mrs Sacoolas “two or three times”. “We said no, we didn’t feel it was right. He said ‘she’s here, let’s get it on, get some healing,’ something like that,” Mr Dunn told the US TV network. “There was a bit of pressure but we stuck to our guns.” In a separate interview, Mr Dunn said: “We didn’t want to be railroaded into, not a circus as such, but into a meeting we weren’t prepared for.” Loading...

    "articleText": "Editor’s note: Trump, according to recent Federal court opinions, confirmed by appeals court, is subject to arrest for these issues in New York. These are, in fact, his biggest vulnerabilities which involve dozens of cases of easily proven lender and tax fraud. “Newly unearthed tax documents show stark differences in how Donald Trump’s real-estate businesses reported losses and profits at two Manhattan buildings, depending on who the intended audience was. ProPublica reports it obtained documents showing Trump’s business gave a lender very different figures than ones provided to New York City tax authorities. The numbers made buildings appear more profitable to the lender, and less profitable to the officials who determined its property tax. The figures show “versions of fraud,” said Nancy Wallace, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley, adding: “This kind of stuff is not OK.” Trump reportedly informed the lender that he took in double the amount of rent from one building as he reported to the tax office in the same year, and gave out two different occupancy figures. New York City’s tax forms state that ‘false filings are subject to all applicable civil and criminal penalties.'” https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-tax-documents-show-wild-inconsistencies-says-report?ref=home from ProPublica: “Taxes have long been a third rail for Trump. Long before he famously declined to make his personal returns public, a New York Times investigation concluded, Trump participated in tax schemes that involved “outright fraud,” and that he had formulated “a strategy to undervalue his parents’ real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns.” Trump’s former partners in Panama claimed in a lawsuit, which is ongoing, that Trump’s hotel management company failed to pay taxes on millions in fees it received. Spokespeople for Trump and his company have denied any tax improprieties in the past. In February, Cohen told Congress that Trump had adjusted figures up or down, as necessary, to obtain loans and avoid taxes. “It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes,” Cohen testified, “and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.” Loading... The two Trump buildings with the most notable discrepancies shared a financial trait: Both were refinanced in 2015 and 2016 while Trump was campaigning for president. The loan for 40 Wall Street — $160 million — was then the Trump Organization’s biggest debt. The fortunes of 40 Wall Street have risen and fallen repeatedly since it was constructed in 1930. Once briefly in the running to become the world’s tallest skyscraper (before being eclipsed by the Chrysler Building and then others), the 71-story landmark had an illustrious history before falling into disrepair as it changed hands multiple times. Trump says in his book “Never Give Up” that he took over 40 Wall Street for $1 million during a down market in 1995. Others have reported the price as $10 million. Trump gave the property his signature treatment, decking out the lobby in Italian marble and bronze and christening it “The Trump Building.” Tenants such as American Express moved in. But the rent rolls suffered when big-name tenants fled to Midtown in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. Less blue-chip operations replaced them. In recent years, there were more setbacks. About two years ago, for example, high-end food purveyor Dean & Deluca canceled plans to locate an 18,500-square-foot emporium on the higher-priced first floor. The space remains empty.” From Veterans Today: Last week a Federal Court in New York affirmed that Trump’s tax returns had to be turned over. The decision (below) went much further, citing that Trump has only very limited protections against indictment and even incarceration and that Trump’s financial dealings in New York were not in any way protected from indictment by a former opinion that Trump believed (and the fake news supported) that asserted otherwise. The court, and now the Federal Appeals Court as well, said the whole thing is “bullshit” and that Trump can be indicted any day and that process, in New York, is ongoing, waiting for what just happened. “An appeals court on Friday rejected President Trump’s plea to halt a subpoena for his financial records by the House Oversight Committee, Politico reported. The subpoena was initially issued earlier this year to the president’s accountants at Mazars USA. The 2-1 decision, with Trump-appointed D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao dissenting, upholds a lower court decision that found the subpoena to be valid. The president’s income-tax returns will likely be handed over to House Democrats soon, but it’s unclear if the case will first see another appeal.”(Daily Beast) VT: The court decision below overturns the Nixon era justice department opinion, never confirmed by the Supreme Court, that a sitting president could not be indicted. The short introduction, including the link to the full decision, bases the claim on a number of obvious issues. A president could be involved in crimes with others and cover for them. Presidents are not Kings, they are both president and a private person, and this is from the founding fathers. There are restrictions to arresting a president but not prohibitions and of the cases involved, many before Trump took office, no immunity is possible and arrest could happen at any time. On others…issues arise here as to procedures and possible protections. Best read it yourself rather than depend on pundits. Trump court finding Loading...

    "title": "Jim Fetzer and Lenny Pozner Testify During Day 2 of Sandy Hook Trial",
    "description": "The afternoon session featured back-to-back testimony from Lenny Pozner and Jim Fetzer.",
    "articleText": "By Kevin Barrett, Veterans Today Editor Madison, WI Jim Fetzer’s defense against Lenny Pozner’s defamation suit got interesting today, day two of the penalty phase of the trial. (Disclaimer: I have been friends with Jim since 2006, and though I don’t always agree with him, I respect his courage and sincerity. It was an honor to have lunch with him on this, the critical day of the penalty phase of his trial.) Pozner won the first phase last June when the court determined that four of Fetzer’s statements alleging a fake death certificate for Noah Pozner were defamatory; then on September 13 Fetzer was found in contempt of court for sharing images of Pozner’s deposition. Fetzer argues that he shared the images, which the court had deemed confidential, as part of his legal defense research. Fetzer claims the images show that the Lenny Pozner in the deposition is not the same person depicted in at least some previous publicly circulated images of Lenny Pozner. Pozner is asking for one million dollars in damages from Fetzer. The jury’s job is to determine an award amount, which theoretically could range anywhere between zero and one million dollars. The penalty phase of the trial began Monday with opening arguments and a lengthy videotaped deposition of a forensic psychologist, who asserts that Pozner suffers from PTSD as a result of Fetzer’s four defamatory statements. The forensic psychologist, who was presumably hired by Pozner’s legal team, predictably supported Pozner’s narrative: After suffering the loss of his son Noah at Sandy Hook, Pozner says, he experienced PTSD for more than a year, only to have his recovery cut short, and his symptoms exacerbated, by his discovery that online Sandy Hook skeptics were claiming that the school shooting was a hoax in which nobody died. Since then, Pozner says, he has been waging an online battle against Sandy Hook skeptics (he calls them “hoaxers”) which has kept him mired in PTSD. Much or most of the suffering he has experienced, Pozner suggests, is the fault of Jim Fetzer, whom Pozner and his lawyers are casting as the kingpin and prime inspiration of the Sandy Hook skeptics’ movement. Fetzer’s legal team questioned the “Fetzer caused my PTSD” claim. While acknowledging that Pozner would have suffered PTSD from the loss of his son in December 2012, they suggested that it was not entirely Fetzer’s fault that Pozner has been re-traumatizing himself by spending much of his time since 2014 combing the internet for material that he says traumatizes him and trying to get it removed. Fetzer’s team’s cross-examination of the psychologist pointed out that normally PTSD sufferers avoid stimuli that reawaken the trauma. The afternoon session featured back-to-back testimony from Lenny Pozner and Jim Fetzer, both called to the stand and questioned by the plaintiff’s (Pozner’s) lawyers. In front of a huge, adorable Noah Pozner picture projected on the screen, Lenny Pozner recounted dropping off his son Noah at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. He described seeing his son’s body at the funeral a few days later. He said that in 2014 he encountered the online claims of Sandy Hook skeptics and tried to engage with them in a cordial and transparent way, but soon began to feel harassed and increasingly upset at their claims that his son Noah had never existed. He said he has persistently tried to get such claims removed from the internet as a way of defending his son. Below are reconstructions from my notes on Pozner’s testimony. The notes were cut short by a bailiff ordering me to shut down my laptop, since I was not one of the two mainstream journalists who had been approved for electronic devices. * Lenny Pozner: Noah was a twin to my youngest daughter. The last time I saw Noah would have been on the morning of December 14. I dropped my three kids off at the car line. (At the funeral) his forehead was the only part that was not covered (due to injuries). I became aware of Mr. Fetzer in mid-2014. (Asked if he had read Jim Fetzer’s edited book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook): No, I haven’t read the book, just the parts about me. I felt it said a lot of ugly things. I wanted to defend my son. I needed to be his voice. (Answering question): I’m concerned for my safety, my family’s safety. I’m concerned for my children’s future, how they could be treated. I was concerned someeone would do something…something bad. (Asked why he thought Fetzer’s four defamatory statements had damaged his reputation): It causes people to believe I lied about my son’s death, that my son didn’t die…. (Asked how he has been affected in terms of fearing contact with people): I’m very cautious about what I reveal…I never know how people might react…people might accuse me of being this villain that Mr. Fetzer portrayed me to be. (Asked whether he held Jim Fetzer responsible for the criminal acts of Lucy Richards, who left obscene, threatening messages on Pozner’s answering machine): Lucy Richards was sentenced to prison for making death threats against me. (But why hold Fetzer responsible?) It was the way she said what she said, and the way she talked about Noah, and about me…she accused me of faking my son’s death, hiding my son, that he’s not really dead. Part of her sentence is she’s not supposed to read (Fetzer’s) website. * Jim Fetzer, called to the stand by the plaintiff’s lawyers as a hostile witness, was questioned about his responsibility for the alleged four defamatory statements, all of which involved claims that the copy of Noah Pozner’s death certificate circulated by Lenny Pozner in 2014 was inauthentic—claims Fetzer still argues were accurate. Fetzer said that he (and in some cases collaborators including co-authors, editors, and publishers) were indeed responsible for publishing those statements, which were not defamatory, but truthful. Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington immediately ordered the jury out of the room and admonished Fetzer that the court had already ruled that those statements were defamatory and that no further impugning the findings of the court would be tolerated. When the jury filed back into the courtroom, Judge Remington ordered them to ignore Fetzer’s statement. Toward late afternoon the defense decided not to call two witnesses, Tony Mead and Kelley Watt, who had traveled from Florida to testify. Both sides offered closing arguments. Though I missed the closing arguments (had to pick up my wife after a dental appointment) a friend and colleague who wishes to remain anonymous summarized them for me. What follows is based on what my source, who was present in the courtroom as a spectator, recounted afterward. Pozner’s attorneys made broad emotional appeals, saying Pozner has experienced pain and suffering due to losing his son and then having the wounds re-opened by his battles with online Sandy Hook skeptics whose ideas, they claim, are derived from Fetzer’s book and web postings. Fetzer’s attorneys argued more narrowly on two key issues. They asked why the psychologist expert witness who diagnosed Pozner with Fetzer-induced PTSD did not estimate any monetary damages from that PTSD. Nor, in fact, did Pozner or his legal team. No claims were made about the dollar value of any losses in earning ability Pozner may or may not have suffered. There was no claim whatsoever of any loss of income or medical bills. Fetzer’s team also argued that Pozner’s side had not presented any convincing evidence supporting the claim that Fetzer’s defamatory statements about the death certificate had caused Lucy Richards or any other unstable Sandy Hook skeptic to harass Pozner; no evidence was presented that the harassers even read Fetzer’s defamatory statements, much less acted on them. Fetzer’s lawyers reminded the jury to set aside their personal feelings and emotions: They shouldn’t decide on the basis of whether they like or dislike Fetzer or agree or disagree with him. Damages are not supposed to be emotional or punitive, Fetzer’s attorneys said, but are only related to actual dollar-value loss (which had not been demonstrated). The jury retired to consider their verdict. A few hours later, well into the evening, they ordered pizza. A few mainstream journalists, including a New York Times reporter, remained in the courtroom to await the verdict. Whatever and whenever the verdict, they have just been scooped by Veterans Today. This is the first report of what went on in the courtroom, and when all the dust has settled it may remain the most fair and balanced. As soon as the verdict is in I will post an update below.

    "articleText": "BC: America, the Runaway Train BC stands for NEO’s Banned Classic. This article was originally published by our journal on 11.06.16 For some reason, this article is missing from Google search results. Since this article remains pretty relevant to those geopolitical events that are taking place on the geopolitical stage today, we deem it possible to present it to our readers once again. Should it go missing again, you may be confident that you will see it republished by NEO once more, should it still remain relevant by that time. Nearly half a century ago I demonstrated to stop the Vietnam War. At the time I was attending Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. On every public occasion, and they have so many in America, holidays of every kind, we would get together, meet in a small park near the state capitol building. By “we” I mean Vietnam veterans, not all of us but most, literally hundreds of us, often bearded with shaggy hair but others who “went along with the program” but to millions of Americans and maybe even hundreds of thousands of veterans, that “program” didn’t include backing America’s war against the people of Vietnam. We marched as a group, wearing the shirts from our “utility” uniforms with ribbon bars attached. The majority, me included, wore combat decorations. We marched side by side with veterans from World War II and Korea, took our place in parades with brass bands and floats. This time is forgotten, the idea that war veterans could stand against wrongdoing, the idea that “warriors” as they now call them, have a moral duty to those who died, and, perhaps much more important, a moral duty to those we killed as well. You see, we who served all knew the Vietnam War was evil, totally wrong and that the government of South Vietnam was utterly corrupt and hated by the Vietnamese people. After all, we were there, it was obvious, any idiot could see it. But then, where are those “idiots” now? Since then America has invaded Panama and Grenada, if you could imagine anything as stupid, and fought several losing wars in the Middle East. It is now considered “passé” to bomb anyone, anytime for any reason, for no reason, to attack any nation and no one says anything, there are no veterans “hitting the streets,” no cities brought to a halt, no president forced into hiding the way Nixon was. More than that, being against war, openly discussing the childish pretexts America used to get into conflict after conflict, questioning the propaganda, the lies, the false flag scenarios like “Tonkin Gulf” were mainstream politics. There was an idea that doing right, as hard as that might be, recognizing how powerful the imbedded forces inside America were that loved so very much to do wrong, to profit from war and suffering, to exploit the poor of the world or to wage useless conflicts for profit, Americans knew about this, recognized it, at least the educated, and this was considered a political issue. The Kennedy’s talked about it, maybe even two were murdered because of speaking up against war or, as is much more likely, speaking up and acting against “the elites” that build the American military machine for one purpose, to cleanse planet Earth of those who oppose “the elites.” Is it that simple, is it a “right or wrong” issue? How did America become a sick place? Loading... Americans have no idea. Propaganda and hate has been stomped into the American soul for so long now, the vast majority of Americans, certainly none that have remained in the military and intelligence services, have a rudimentary knowledge of right and wrong. They don’t care, never ask questions, always take the easy way out, sell out for a paycheck or, at higher levels, a chance at “hind teat.” We can lay out the history, find groups to blame, point fingers, even suggest solutions but it is clearly time America admitted one thing, to the majority of people in the world, America is the “Evil Empire,” the “bad guy,” to be feared, even hated. Yes, people from around the world want to come to America but there is a new reason. Despite the horrific damage done to America by the elites who have bought government, the total surveillance state with militarized police and rigged elections, America has done far worse to other nations, leaving them stripped bare. Do we need a list? There is little question America has destroyed Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan. These nations have been stripped bare, the death toll may be questioned, whether hundreds of thousands or millions, but the blame is purely American. America, or the elites, and calling criminals “elites” is a painful habit, have inherited the mantle of the mercantilists of the 18th century. It goes further than the bombed out counties, a list that grows each year. Even Europe at the verge of collapse is only a small part of it as is the Far East, waiting for a meaningless war to be staged there as well. The human spirit, the will to resist, is being crushed around the world. There is no shortage of conflicts, but as even the most simplistic research will quickly yield, the “elites” quickly hijack every movement, every citizens revolt, using social media, paid actors, seeding black propaganda, turning anything positive, anything good or clean into “more of the same,” two-bit color revolutions and “aggressive war on the cheap” fought by deluded fools and $300 a month mercenaries. Read Dickens, it’s in there. Colonial wars were, at least in the 19th century, considered a normal outlet for dealing with Europe’s “overpopulation.” You either sent “surplus population” overseas, exiled them to places like Australia or other penal colonies, or killed them off in wars, marching tens of thousands a day into waiting machineguns as was done at the Somme in 1915. The Britain we see today was made at the Somme and fields like it, where an unwanted generation was purposefully butchered. You see, Britain had no need for “the best and brightest,” the “elites” who profit from slavery, human and narcotics trafficking, from controlling mineral wealth or staging theatrical wars knew that generations of “the capable” would be a threat. War after war kept the British people slavish and subservient, produced leaders like Blair and Cameron. Even Germany is no longer Germany. Would Hitler have changed all of that, was there some secret purpose, perhaps not so secret, in warring against exactly what we are talking about. But, then again, having this discussion about Hitler or the Kaiser or what the World Wars were really about is actually illegal and if not “illegal” is certainly not something to be discussed. Try discussing the Soviet Union. This is no longer 1991. Today’s world, with the Soviet Union gone, is far worse than it had been with them around. Could a case be made for Soviet Russia and Communism as a bulwark against “the elites,” all that stood then against slavery for mankind and the armies of bankers, just as Marx and Lenin had warned? Frankly, we can’t even discuss these things, not and hope to be heard, we can’t teach them in schools, best not publish them in books, certainly we can’t bring this into the political arena. What about those who pick up that mantle, who “stand against?” Were one to look for lists of “monsters and tyrants” chances are such a list would be populated by those the veterans who marched with me in 1970 and until the Vietnam War ended, might well have been on another list, one quite different in nature. As unpleasant as such things have become, we will take a moment to look at the “Obama question.” This is a man that, while in the Senate, stood against the war in Iraq. This is a man outspoken against torture, against rendition, a man with a liberal domestic policy, who closed many doors on “the elites” who had bankrupted America under Bush. Yet Obama never challenged “Homeland Security,” the monstrous dehumanizing bureaucracy that undermined all constitutional limitations on centralized power, a challenge to Federalism that no one spoke against, not “strict constructionists,” not “conservatives” nor any, not one, on the Supreme Court. Drone killings have gone on, and if anything gotten worse. America still pours cash into Israel, and Israel still wars on the world. Nothing has been investigated, least of all the childish pretext of “9/11,” now more “sick joke” than national tragedy. In light of the disclosure of the decades long secret partnership between Israel and Saudi Arabia, no informed person can question what really happened then nor can they doubt why. Though Obama pushed through the Iran settlement, he is still leading NATO to war against Russia, he allowed the monstrous coup, or better termed “soft invasion” of Ukraine and still pushes an insane war against the people of Yemen. Moreover, America’s covert role in supporting ISIS, al Nusra, al Shabab and Boko Haram is the worst kept secret in the world. Since the Vietnam War and the widespread civil revolt that brought down a president and ended a war, there has been but a short-lived “anti-Wall Street” movement, quickly brought down by the state and dwindling protests against the daily police murders of people of color. Past that, all civil demonstrations in America either support war, call for more oppression or are orchestrated by “elites” and stacked with FBI informants and agent provocateurs. Everyone else is either complacent, bought off or afraid.

As Gordon published last week, VT was shown the Syrian archive files of Turkey’s looting of Aleppo, factories cleaned out of their product inventories and with their machinery ripped from its foundations and shipped back to Turkey. The Kurds are no angels, as they assisted ISIS in moving their huge tanker columns of stolen Syrian oil through Iraq up to Turkey’s back door for a discounted-sale transaction. So Mr. Erdogan cries crocodile tears. Mass media never covered any of the above, but at least it is covering the large number of countries aligned against the Turkish incursion. When is the last time Turkey has done anything real for a coalition it is in? Here is the blooper Erdogan made this morning over his fake Kurdish terror war claims. “We are members of NATO, and the charter of the bloc has Article 5 (urging the response of all members of the alliance when one of them is under attack). We are under the threat of a terrorist organisation. And in accordance with Article 5, NATO should be with us. Loading... Notice he used the term ‘under the threat of” not being attacked, as he has always been indicating but never saying it in plain English because he has never offered any proof, like Syrian Kurd perpetrators caught in the act inside Turkey. Erdogan is talking about a separate Kurdish group on the Iraq border. But because Erdogan has used proxy terrorism in his foreign policy against Syria in a number of way, he has put Turkey on the firing line for getting some payback, which is legal under the 4th Geneva conditions as in, “Do unto others as they do unto you.” Erdogan has been an embarrassment to both Iran and Russia in the Astana group, using the leverage he has via buying Iranian oil and getting Russian arms and the gas pipeline, while being a rogue member of their group.

An arms sales embargo and other measures are on the table over what Turkey touts as a legitimate counterterrorist campaign. Erdogan on Monday criticized a lack of support from nations that are supposed to be allies under NATO. “According to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which side should they take? They need to stand by us,” he told reporters, referring to the cornerstone of the agreement that says a military attack on one member is an attack on all of them. Erdogan said some people in Turkey thought the mistreatment was due to the fact that their nation is the only Muslim-majority NATO ally. He chose to believe that European leaders were simply misinformed about what Ankara was doing, the president said. “I’ve seen that they, unfortunately, do not know many of the facts and are under the pressure of very serious disinformation,” he said. Turkey’s Operation Spring of Peace targets Syrian Kurdish militias, which in Ankara’s eyes are nothing but an extension of its domestic Kurdish guerrillas. Supporters of the Kurds say they played a key part in defeating jihadist forces in the northeastern part of the country, with the US providing air and artillery support. Loading...

Will the YPG be shifted to other less sensitive areas, or will it be disbanded and absorbed into the Syrian military under one command? Will it be morphed into a national guard? It seems like Erdogan is more concerned with his economy in free fall and that weakening his political power at home. Turkey is a great tourist designation now, with the lira in the toilet. If the Kurdish border simmers down, maybe this diplomatic progress can slide over to Idlib where the situation is reversed. It is Turkey who is supporting Muslim jihad terrorism in Syria, so maybe Syria should impose the Jim Dean plan, a 30-kilometer “safe zone” inside Turkey to prevent jihadis, weapons and supplies moving over the border. That would be an interesting discussion. I have this wonderful video of an Erdogan adviser, in Turkish, explaining to the host how he tried to get the jihadis to calm things down in Idlib, as they already controlled it and raising hell there was going to keep getting them bombed by the SAA. He suggested that if they wanted to kill infidels, the jihadis should go to Damascus, Homs, Latakia, Deir Ezzor, anywhere in Syria and knock themselves out.

Our aim is to identify an acceptable solution. We want the areas under the control of the Syrian government to be cleared of militants of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party [PKK] and the Self Defense Forces [YPG],” told a news conference in Istanbul on October 18, according to the Russian news agency TASS. The Turkish President went on to state that he has no objections against placing the “safe-zone” under the Damascus government’s control. On October 9, the Turkish military and its Syrian proxies launched a large-scale military operation to establish the “safe-zone” in northeast Syria. However, a breakthrough deal between Damascus and Kurdish forces allowed Syrian troops to enter the region, which limited the movement of Turkish forces. Facing this unexpected development, Turkey accepted a US-proposed ceasefire which would force Kurdish forces out of the designated “safe-zone.” Less than 24 hours after its beginning, the ceasefire appears to be collapsing, with both side not fulfilling their commitments. Erdogan’s new statements indicate that Ankara likely hopes to strike a deal with Moscow that would force Kurdish forces out of the “safe-zone” in exchange for the deployment of the Syrian military.

Click to donate >> – First published … October 18, 2019 – US President Donald Trump’s decision to pull American troops out of Syria seems to be linked to the escape of Daesh elements from jails in the north of the Arab country, which can finally result in the regrouping of the notorious Takfiri terrorist outfit, a media report says. Fears are growing that thousands of Daesh terrorists may escape from Syrian jails, as Kurdish prison guards are reportedly leaving their posts to gear up for fighting back the Turkish military that has started an operation against Kurds in northeastern Syria. The operation started following the Trump decision, which was widely seen as a go-ahead to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the beginning of Operation Peace Spring. Experts have told Sputnik Arabic that a big question mark hangs over the pullout, as Washington was fully aware of the huge number of Daesh terrorists held in prisons under the authority of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northern Syria. Enas al-Maqsusi, an Iraqi lawmaker from the Sairoon alliance, told Sputnik on Thursday that the move was part of an international plot against Syria and Iraq, warning about its dangers for the two Arab countries and the entire region. She said what was happening in northern Syria was “an episode of an international series with known goals and heroes.” The lawmaker says the fact that Daesh members have remained in the SDF prisons up to now, especially without a trial, is questionable. “One can say they have been held up to now in order to be allowed to leave at a certain time, which is happening now, especially as these operations will be followed by other scenarios that will become clear in the coming days,” she noted. Maqsusi expressed surprise at the withdrawal of US forces from Syria and said the move will help Daesh reorganize itself. Back on Tuesday, a senior Iraqi security expert claimed that Washington is attempting to transfer 3,000 members of the Daesh terrorist group from Syria to Iraq. Hafez al-Basharah told the Arabic-language al-Ma’aloumeh news website that the US is plotting to create a safe area for Daesh members in Iraq. He added that Washington has chosen three areas in Iraq for the Daesh relocation, and seeks to transfer the militants first to the regions under Turkey’s military attacks in Syria and then to Iraq. “The first region that the US intends to transfer the Daesh terrorists is an area between Al-Bukamal in Syria and Qa’em in Iraq; the second region is Ain al-Assad base; and the third area is one of the US bases in the Iraqi Kurdistan region,” Basharah said, according to Fort-Russ website. The Arabic-language media outlets had reported in July that Washington planned to bring back a more dangerous version of Daesh to Iraq and Syria after its failure to achieve its goals in the region. Last year, Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei had warned that the United States was relocating Daesh from the Middle East to Afghanistan to rationalize its military presence in the region. By transferring Daesh from Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan, the White House seeks “to justify the continuation of its presence in the region and to create security for the Zionist regime,” Ayatollah Khamenei said in January 2018.

Click to donate >> – First published … October 18, 2019 – Turkish airstrikes kill at least five civilians while sporadic clashes continue with Kurdish forces despite a ceasefire agreed between Ankara and Washington in northeast Syria. Machine gun fire and shelling could be heard while smoke arose from one part of the town, Reuters reported on Friday. Probable casualties and damage resulting from the clashes in the town have yet to be confirmed. The civilians were killed following Turkish airstrikes on Bab al-Kheir which lies east of Ras al-Ayn, according to Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The reports come only 13 hours after Turkey agreed to “pause” the assault for five days allowing Kurdish fighters to withdraw from a determined “safe zone” north of Syria. The Turkish capital hosted more than five hours of negotiations between a US delegation and Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier in the day. US Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Thursday that Ankara’s incursion “will be halted entirely on completion” of the withdrawal of the fighters. Certain details regarding the withdrawal, however, appear to be disputed between the parties to the agreement. Pence has said that the deal obliges Turkey to not engage in military operations in the Syrian border town of Ayn al-Arab, also known as Kobani. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has, however, said Ankara has made no commitments about the town. Also speaking on Thursday, Mazlum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces which leads Kurdish-led forces in the region, told a Kurdish TV station that the group would accept the deal but that it was limited to the border areas running between Ras al-Ayn and the town of Tal Abyad. Turkey launched its invasion of Syria on October 9 with the alleged aim of creating a “safe zone” south of its border with Syria. Ankara says Kurdish forces operating in the area are terrorists linked to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militant group, which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984. Speaking earlier on Thursday, however, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad dismissed Ankara’s announced objectives in Syria. “No matter what false slogans could be made up for the Turkish offensive, it is a flagrant invasion and aggression,” he said. The Syrian president vowed to “respond to the assault and confront it anywhere within the Syrian territory through all legitimate means available.” Earlier this week, Syria deployed troops to northern Syria after Kurdish-led forces turned to Damascus to counter the Turkish invasion. Kremlin urges Ankara to provide details Following the deal on Thursday, Moscow issued a statement urging Ankara to provide information regarding the deal negotiated with the US. “We expect to receive information from Turkey,” Russia’s RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Erdogan is due to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Syria next week in Russia. Russian troops have also been deployed alongside the Syrian forces that have been sent to counter the Turkish invasion. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that its military police were patrolling areas between Turkish and Syrian forces near Syria’s northern city of Manbij, which is a flash point currently under Syrian control. The patrols seeks to avoid confrontations between the two opposing forces. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

Turkey last week began pounding the positions of Kurdish fighters with jets and artillery and sent in troops to purge them from the area east of Euphrates. The offensive came three days after Trump announced he would pull US troops from the region, effectively exposing its allied Kurdish militants to their archenemy, Turkey. Trump’s move to withdraw troops from Syria was widely condemned by both Republican and Democratic Party lawmakers in Congress. On Thursday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said his government will respond through all legitimate means available to the Turkish offensive. During a meeting with visiting Iraqi National Security Advisor Falih al-Fayyadh in Damascus, Assad said foreign schemes in the Middle East region have been foiled throughout history, and the Turkish criminal aggression, launched by Erdogan’s administration, on Syria falls within such plots.

October 17, 2019 – On October 16, units of the Syrian Army entered the city of Raqqah for the first time since 2014. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has controlled the city since 2017, when they with help from the United States seized it from ISIS. The Syrian Army reportedly established several observation posts in the area and continued deployment within the SDF-held area. According to pro-government sources, government troops are also preparing to enter the Omar oil fields. A day earlier, on October 15, Syrian troops and Russian Military Police units started patrolling the contact line between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF near Manbij. On October 16, US-led coalition forces withdrew from the Kharab Ashk military base where dozens of US and French troops had been deployed. US-led forces burned the base in order to destroy equipment that they were not able to evacuate. The Turkish Army and Turkish-backed militants are developing their offensive on SDF positions. They captured thirteen villages west of Tell Abyad and made another attempt to secure Ras al-Ayn. According to pro-SDF sources, 49 Turkish-backed militants were killed in an SDF counter-attack in the town. SDF units employed US-supplied military equipment. Pro-Turkish militants captured a Humvee armored vehicle near the town. There are also reports that the SDF and the Syrian Army jointly recaptured the villages of al-Ahras, al-Rihaniyah and Manajir from Turkish-led forces south of Ras al-Ayn. Loading...

Whatever the case, Syria is back, as the Syrian Arab Army races toward the Turkish border, at least in those areas where Turkey isn’t already engaged in intense combat with Kurdish forces. Then, on October 16, Erdogan announced he would refuse to meet Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo and the current national security advisor, nobody bothers learning their names, they only last a few days. Erdogan says, “Trump or nothing. We also know a visit to Moscow with Putin is scheduled, one or two days? First of all, perceptions are, when war is involved, always misconceptions. When you win one war, you simply prepare for the next one and there is always a next one. You know, the situation here reminds me in some ways of China after the US entered World War II. General “Vinegar Joe” Stillwell was tasked by President Roosevelt and Chairman JCOS Marshall to bring together Chaing and Mao in a unified front against the Japanese. There had been cooperation inside China between Chaing and Mao after the death of Sun Yat Sen. Despite fake history, Chaing Kai-shek was certainly a communist, a devotee of Stalin but of a different breed and variety than Mao and his followers who the US termed as “agrarian reformers.” The two great leaders came to blows in 1934 leading to the People’s Liberation Army fleeing across China in what was termed the Long March. Japan took advantage of circumstances, having seized Manchuria in 1931 and began further incursions into mainland China. In 1936, General Zhang Zueliang kidnapped Chaing and forced a detente that would allow joint opposition to Japan to take precedent over the ongoing civil war. This is the situation Stillwell inherited when he entered Chunking, as it was spelled then, the inland provisional capitol of China. Problem is, as America poured cash into Chaing’s war effort, none was spent fighting the Japanese and all was withheld to fight the next war, assuming the US would defeat Japan, an obvious inevitability. Chaing’s wife was Mei-ling Soong. Her brother was TV Soong, the Rothschild banking partner that controlled much of the banking in the Far East. Thus, American cash intended to fight Japan in actuality bought much of General Motors though a complex system of leveraged stock purchases while more cash still was spent in Washington buying support for Chaing from among the political enemies of President Roosevelt, many of whom were at one-point strong supporters of Adolf Hitler. One asks then, why the history lesson and how does this apply? Well, let’s see, Turkey and Russia are close friends, and there are strong suspicions that Donald Trump pushed Turkey into the Russian camp. As to whether this policy serves America as well is yet to be seen. If Trump is correct, and 20 years of deeply embedded American policy has been poorly conceived and based on fake evidence and falsified intelligence, then derailing this policy with a pull out in Syria and realignment with Turkey may well force America to mend its ways despite efforts by the powerful Israel policy to keep America at war in the Middle East forever. Call this “educated conjecture.” We then look at who the Kurds really are. Back in 2007, when Turkey invaded Iraq to confront the PKK, a communist Kurdish splinter group Turkey terms as terrorist, I sat down to what was a daily meal with Kurdish leaders for what turned out to be an education. “We want Turkey to destroy the PKK. Look at the meal on the table. We have rice, we have fish from the Euphrates River for you, our honored guest, we have chicken, flown in from America on C130s, but little else, no olives, no oils to cook with, do you know why? You see, nothing comes from Baghdad. Our trade is with Turkey and Syria but the road to Syria is closed and our border with Turkey is now a warzone where the PKK makes our lives impossible. We have no gasoline, no diesel fuel, we can’t repair our water system and sewers, our hospitals have no medicines, you see, not all Kurds are real Kurds, some are communists with their own loyalties and ideas. We are building a nation and they would tear it down over politics, greed and fake idealism. We want our children to return from around the world now that Saddam is gone.” The message, a simple one, the Kurds fighting Turkey weren’t the Kurds that made up the majority, the autonomous KRG in Iraq, nearly 9 million, with another 3 million or more in diaspora. Moreover, as with China, it has been the job of the Kurds in Iraq to maintain a homeland, working with Baghdad, Washington, Ankara, Tel Aviv or whoever is necessary. Additionally, and paraphrasing Donald Trump, the fight with ISIS was not a Kurdish fight but rather one with roots, at least inside Iraq, between former Sunni Baathists and the Shiite majority. In time, as with China, the threat of ISIS became clear and a joint effort, with Iran taking on a significant role, much more significant than the US, deciding the conflict. Then we look to Syria. The Turkish incursion just returned Syria’s water supplies, their oil fields, their best agricultural land. We also note that Trump’s statements that the Kurd’s didn’t have “clean hands” to an extent is based on the poor decision making of the socialist groups that made up the Kurdish forces allied to Washington and their desire to ethnically cleanse Syria’s Arabs, an effort that consumed much more time than fighting ISIS. Yet we see the figure of 11,000 dead but little evidence of fighting, no video, no reporters on the ground except for a closely controlled “tame” few. The Kurdish and American war on ISIS is the least reported, worst documented war in world history. What is evident, as is always the case, is that all parties are now realigning for a new war. What is clear is that the time of orchestrated “Arab Spring” conflicts and American mischief is at an end, leaving things as they were before 9/11, at the brink of a very different war with nothing changed.

Seyyed Abbas Araqchi made the remarks in a meeting on Wednesday with his Swedish counterpart Anika Soder in Tehran, where they held the fifth round of Iran-Sweden political consultations. Araqchi said that Iran’s decision to take further steps towards suspending its nuclear commitments “will remain unchanged until the desired conditions are met and Iran’s economic interests from the JCPOA are ensured.” In compliance with Articles 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, Iran has, since May, gone through three stages in scaling back parts of its commitments in retaliation for Washington’s withdrawal from the accord and Europe’s failure to protect Iran against the sanctions that the US re-imposed on the country in the aftermath of its exit. Iran has given another two months to the European signatories to take meaningful action to save the JCPOA as a France-led diplomatic process is underway between the two sides. PressTV-‘Iran mulls more steps to slash JCPOA commitments’ Loading... Tehran says it will reverse the decision if the other parties take action to save the nuclear deal. Tehran says its reciprocal measures will be reversible as soon as Europe finds practical ways to shield the Iranian economy from unilateral US bans. Araqchi said despite Washington’s withdrawal from the JCPOA and re-imposition of sanctions, “Iran has tried to keep the windows of interaction and diplomacy open, while Europe has only relied on political support and refused to keep the accord alive.” “Iran’s decision to put up maximum and active resistance against was a response to Washington’s “unacceptable” of “maximum pressure” in dealing with the Islamic Republic, the official said. He said that Iran’s one-sided implementation of the deal’s terms is not justifiable, calling on Europe to “adopt constructive approaches” and “rebuild trust” with Iran. Soder, for her part, said that Sweden along with other European countries would continue efforts to preserve Iran nuclear deal. During the Wednesday meeting, Araqchi and Soder also discussed the latest international developments as well as issues of mutual interests. Loading...

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also confirmed that the two sides had agreed on a “great” new Brexit deal, which would still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments. “We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control,” Johnson said in a tweet. “Now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.” British lawmakers are set to vote on the agreement during a special sitting of the House of Commons on Saturday.

Trump and Erdogan, in another phone call we would all love to hear, agreed to push the lie that the American trained and supplied YPG that has lost 11k fighters under US command, is actually a terrorist group and that he, Donald Trump now supports their mass murder. Below, from Foreign Policy, journal of the Council on Foreign Relations, the prime advisory group for the US State Department is their contrary opinion on the subject: Syria’s Kurds Are Not the PKK Amid the war against the Islamic State, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is bombing our villages and soldiers on an entirely false pretense. BY ALDAR KHALIL for Foreign Policy Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan bombed and shelled our villages in northern Syria. The strikes killed our soldiers and unnecessarily escalated the conflict between Turkey and us at a time when we are engaged in a historic battle alongside U.S.-led international coalition forces to retake Raqqa and end the Islamic State’s reign of terror. Loading... I am a member of the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM), an umbrella organization made up of six political parties and civil society institutions, including the Democratic Union Party (PYD), the leading Kurdish party in northern Syria. We are recognized by the PYD, as well as the People’s Protection Units (YPG) and Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) as their political leadership. We are devoted to building an egalitarian, democratic, and ethical society where Arabs, Kurds, and Syriacs — along with Muslims, Christians and Yazidis — all live peacefully side by side and where women are treated equal to men. In justifying this egregious attack on northern Syria, Erdogan used a common refrain. The PYD and the Syrian Kurds, he said, are the same as the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), making them terrorists. Erdogan recently repeated this allegation, saying that he is “seriously saddened” by television footage showing U.S. military forces operating alongside what he considers a terrorist insignia — our flag. And on May 3, one of his senior advisors went further: He suggested that U.S. forces, because they operate alongside our forces and are patrolling the Syrian-Turkish border, could also be targeted by the Turkish military. These statements are remarkable — a NATO member country is accusing its American ally of working with terrorists and, as a result, threatening U.S. soldiers. Putting aside political circumstances and repercussions of this accusation, it is important to set the record straight. We are not the PKK, no matter how much Erdogan wishes it were so, and it is not difficult to explain why. Modern Kurdish groups can trace their political philosophies to one of two founding figures: Mustapha Barzani and Abdullah Ocalan. The fundamental distinction between the two is that while Barzani, the father of the current president of Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Massoud Barzani, called for building a nationalist Kurdish state based on aristocracy and the rule of a few, Ocalan called for a socialist state where all were equal. Over time, Ocalan evolved his ideas from socialism to federalism, believing that a democracy where power is decentralized is the best way to protect both individual and collective freedoms. The influences of these figures and ideas can be seen today. Iraq’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) springs from the Barzani school of thought, and as a result the KRG is ruled by a few, with power and wealth concentrated in the hands of the Barzani family and its friends. Ocalan’s school of thought, on the other hand, extends to the PYD, Turkey’s pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), and the PKK, as well as other groups in Iraq and Iran. All these groups have implemented Ocalan’s ideas differently and pursued different aims, as we interact with different geopolitical players. We don’t deny our relationships with all Kurdish parties in the four parts of Kurdistan (spread across present-day Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq), as we don’t deny our connection to Ocalan. In fact, as I write this, I am proud to say I have a photo of Ocalan on my desk next to me. Ocalan’s views and philosophy are at the core of how we govern the Northern Syrian Federation, or Rojava. And they are why, under our control, northern Syria has become a model — respecting the rights of minority groups and women, and ensuring that individual and collective freedoms are not only protected but empowered. We also don’t deny that PKK also traces its school of thought back to Ocalan. However, their implementation of his teachings differs greatly from ours, and their political circumstances do as well. These distinctions are important, however much Erdogan wishes the world to ignore them. We can share a founding philosophical father without being the same organization. Having different leadership, different members, and publicly stating we are different — as we are doing in this article and have done numerous times in the past — should be a clear indication as to our intent. Simply put, we are our own organization, and we are proud of that. As Kurds, we of course sympathize with our brothers and sisters in Turkey. Many of their towns are divided along our border, partly residing in Turkey and partly in northern Syria. Historically, many Syrian Kurds joined the struggle in Turkey and were martyred there. Equally, some Kurds from Turkey and Iraq came to Syria to join the heroic resistance of Kobani against the Islamic State, and were martyred in Rojava. The PKK offered its help to Kobani, as did the United States. It pains us to see those on the Turkish side of the border suffer from oppression and fear under Erdogan. But that is not our struggle, and we have said publicly and will say again that our territory and resources are not going to be used by the PKK or any other groups fighting Turkey. We don’t interfere in the domestic affairs of neighboring countries, and we expect other countries to do the same. READ MORE < Loading...

    "articleText": "…by Sajjad Shaukat for Veterans Today First of all, it is clarified that many Jewish writers have objected that a number of writers and authors confuse the term Khazarian Mafia by amalgamating it with the Jews. But, fact remains that in context of the modern history, collective interests and present phenomena of the world, it is much difficult to differentiate between these two entities. We should know that by ignoring their strong alignment, still, a majority of the writers, bloggers and authors use the term Khazarian Mafia instead of Khazarian Jewish Mafia. Wikipedia points out that the Khazarian king Bulan (Khazar) had chosen Judaism as the religion of the Khazarians. So, as regards the earlier history, we can use the term Khazarian Mafia. But, now, we should use the term Khazarian Jewish Mafia (KJM). However, visibly or invisibly, many big cartels of the world are owned by the KJM. By controlling the major multinational corporations, arms factories, five star hotels, oil companies, liquor business, food industries, technologies, mining and mineral resources, banks, film industry, print and electronic media in the US in particular and the world in general—having influence on the UNO, financial institutes like World Bank and IMF, Khazarian Jewish Mafia (KJM) has converted the world into a corporate industry, which manly work for the interests of the Mafia. When we talk about the control of the United States and the world, there is no difference between the Khazarian Mafia, Jews and Israel. In this regard, many intellectuals like Don Allen and others reveal, “The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)…was part of a conspiracy to gain control of both US political parties to use them as instruments…seventy-three percent of the members of the Council on Foreign Relations are Jews. There are a number of organizations that comprise the Invisible Government that runs America and the world…from behind the scenes. A Jewish group which is in control of national governments and multinational corporations promotes world government through control of the military, media, foundation grants and education including NGOs…and controls and guides the issues of the day, and thus they control most options available. They will manage the money, the land, the food, and the guns of everyone in the world.” In the words of Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, “It is long been clear that the pro-Israel, ultra-Zionist network have absolute control over the United States. The idea that our leaders are pursuing America’s vital national interests abroad…is a myth.” Nevertheless, it is most surprising to note that especially since the orchestrated drama of the 9/11 attacks on the one side, Khazarian Jewish Mafia has been acting upon its evil designs by targeting the non-Zionist Americans and entire international community, while, on the other, it is, rapidly, jeopardizing its financial interests by destabilizing the global economy, which shows cognitive dissonance of the Mafia. It is notable that after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, in consultation with his Zionist-advisers and neoconservatives, American former President Bush (The Senior) introduced the New World Order (NWO), with the US acting as a global policeman to protect the political and economic interests of Israel and the American Jews. The Third World (Islamic World) was compelled to realign their domestic policies according to Washington’s dictates. In this respect, UNO, IMF and World Bank were also used as the KJM agents. In order to obtain the hidden agenda of the Khazarian Jewish Mafia, the US imposed its sudden terms of globalization such as quick liberalization of economy, free markets, privatization and de-nationalization etc. on the ill-prepared less developed countries, which resulted into foreign-based dominance of the MNCs which easily defeated the host states’ economic plan and monetary policy—left behind shattered nations and a global financial crisis. It further widened the gap between the poor and the rich countries (Or G-7). In this context, Professor Timothy Gorringe in his book, “Fair Shares: Ethics and the Global Economy”, writes “Globalization…trade is largely controlled by a small number of huge corporations…disintegration of communities and its replacement by the market…has the potential of destroying society.” It is mentionable that the US and other developed countries produce ‘surplus’ which is being exported to the less developed countries, including the Islamic countries. Latest machines produce products quickly, and rapid means of communication and correspondence through internet or email have accelerated the business transactions. But, in the present world, terrorism is being manipulated by the KJM, while, at the same time, they are damaging their monetary interests by following conflicting strategies. In the recent years, during the meetings of IMF, World Bank and World Trade Organization; violent protests were seen by the anti-globalists who were Western nationals. Surprisingly, despite its failure, KJM continued to drive the project of globalization without bothering for its negative impact which is harming monetary interests of the Mafia. In political terms, America’s child-killing sanctions against Iraq and Iran; late action to curb ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, support to Israel’s aggressive occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, with vetoing any effective action by the UN to curb the Israeli state terrorism greatly annoyed the Muslims all over the world. Similarly, this mafia continued to back Indian state terrorism in the Indian Occupied Kashmir. When President George W. Bush became the US president, he and the neo-conservatives crossed all the limits in securing the political, economic and religious interests of the Jews and Israel at the cost of Muslims and patriot Americans. Under the mask of the 9/11 catastrophe, their preplanned strategy led by KJM headed towards dangerous moves like employment of power-diplomacy on the weak states like Pakistan and other Muslim countries, including almost all the Arab states which joined Bush’s phony anti-terrorism war, while American President Barrack also followed similar flawed policies to safeguard the illegitimate interests of Israel and the KJM. Obama and Bush deliberately created chaos in the Muslim World. In this connection, occupation of Afghanistan (Prolonged war) and Iraq, proxy wars in the Middle East, regime change in Libya and Egypt through unrest, support to Al-Qaeda (Al-Nusra Front) and Islamic State group (Also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh) by American CIA-Israeli Mossad in Syria and Iraq, promotion of sectarian violence in the Islamic World on the basis of Shia and Sunni have given a greater blow to the world’s economic stability which is essential for Khazarian Jewish Mafia. When in September 2015, Russian-led coalition of Iran, Iraq, the Syrian army-the National Defense Forces (NDF) and Lebanon-based Hezbollah started breaking the backbone of the terrorists of ISIS, Al-Qaeda’s Al-Nusra Front and the rebels in Syria and Iraq, Mossad which was already having clandestine contact with the ISIS directed this outfit to plan the November 13 (2015) terror attacks in Paris in connivance with the French home-grown militants. Similarly, when Russian-led forces began retaking many cities from the control of these insurgents, on the other side, agents of Mossad who were in collaboration with the CIA sympathizers and the ISIL militants arranged various sorts of terror attacks in Europe and the US. Through all these false flag terror operations, the US and Israel wanted to obtain the covert aims of the KJM against Russia, the Muslims and the patriot Americans. Mossad had also provided the pro-Israeli US President Donald Trump with an opportunity to manipulate various terror assaults of Europe and America to win the US presidential election and to reunite America and Europe, as a rift was created between America and its Western allies, especially Europe on a number of issues, including NATO and trade. And President Trump had left no stone unturned in implementing anti-Muslim policies, while speaking openly against the Muslims and Syrian immigrants. Trump had started exaggerating the threat of Islamophobia, while, some incidents were not linked to ISIS, but were the result of self-radicalization of the individuals. After becoming the US President, Donald Trump started acting upon the hidden agenda of Israel and the Khazarian Jewish Mafia. His decisions such as tough screening process for the Muslims and executive order regarding a ban on arrivals to the US from a number of mainly-Muslim countries might be cited as instance. President Trump’s connections with Israel and KJM were undoubtedly proved when Trump Administration announced the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018. President Trump implemented his decision of December 6, 2018 by officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and reversed nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and set in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City. Khazarian Jewish Mafia forgot that angry elements within the Muslim countries, particularly in the pro-Arab states may react against America and its interests in the form of terrorism and other violent actions. Unquestionably, the US president’s move on Jerusalem have created new risks for Washington, as the decision offered extremist groups a valuable opportunity to capitalise on anti-US sentiment and direct such anger towards those Arab countries which are close to America and non-confrontational towards Israel. While, the world is already witnessing various kinds of terrorism-related assaults, acceleration of terror-attacks would further destabilize the world by giving a greater setback to the political and economic interests of the KJM. Besides, it was owing to the encouragement of the President Trump that the Israeli regime officially declared their status as “the Jewish State” where only Jewish people have rights to self-determination. Meanwhile, in the recent years, various developments such as reluctance of NATO countries to support America’s fake global war on terror, acceptance of Syrian refuges by the European countries, especially Germany, criticism of the controversial Turkish-EU refugee deal by a number of human rights groups, the EU rule to boycott goods produced in Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Britain’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), after the referendum (Brexit) on June 24, 2016—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck a new Brexit agreement with the European Union on October 17, this year, which still needs the approval of both the UK and European parliaments, (Today on October 18, 2019, UK parliament will approve or reject the agreement), the divide between the elite class which run multinational companies with the direct or indirect control of the Jews (KJM) and the general masses who are suffering from multiple problems in wake of differences on the refugee crisis, Syrian war, Greece’s weak economy, violent protests against the labour laws in France etc.—the chances of European Union’s disintegration and a rift among the NATO countries, as noted by the “Stop NATO protests in Europe are quite opposite to the Israeli secret interests and those of the KJM. In case of the South Asia, cognitive dissonance of the Khazarian Jewish Mafia is also damaging their interests. In this respect, on the one hand, the Mafia considers India as its largest market, while, it is creating unrest in the region on the other. In this connection, since the fundamentalist party BJP led by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in India, it has been implementing anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan agenda. Encouraged by the fanatic Trump, assaults on Muslims, Christians and other minorities by the Hindu extremist parties have continued. New Delhi which has strategic partnership with Tel Aviv has perennially been exploiting the double game of the US-led West in relation to world phenomena of terrorism in relation to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Tensions between India and Pakistan reached a feverish pitch on August 5, this year, when New Delhi unilaterally annexed the occupied Kashmir, revoking articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution which gave a special status to the disputed territory. A strict lockdown was imposed, which has snapped off ordinary people’s internet and mobile telephone service to hide India’s human rights violations and to cut off that region from the world. More than two months have been passed. But, Indian forces have continued lockdown and curfew in wake of shortage of foods and even medicines for the patients. Besides, Indian extremist rulers are also escalating tensions with Pakistan to divert attention from the drastic situation of the Indian Controlled Kashmir, and have continued shelling inside Pakistani side of Kashmir. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan was on seven-day visit to the New York City in connection with the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly opened on September 24, 2019. In his interaction with the US lawmakers, scholars, human rights activists and the media, and meetings with the US President Donald Trump and world’s other leaders, he briefed them on the repercussions of the Indian annexation of the disputed Kashmir valley. And during his speech at the UNGA, Imran reiterated the drastic implications of the lockdown in Kashmir, including dimensions of the Islamophobia and some other issues the world is facing. On these occasions, P.M. Imran Khan straightforwardly and realistically exposed US-led West’s double standards which also indicate the contradictory policies of the KJM. In this context, Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “The Indian occupied region has been facing a lockdown and clampdown since August 5…I fear that after the curfew is lifted, there would be a massacre [of Kashmiris] by the 900,000 Indian troops deployed there…Once a conflict starts between two nuclear armed nations, it goes beyond our hands… Unfortunately, India today is governed by a racist, Hindu supremacist party RSS…For what purpose was the UN established?…lukewarm response shown thus far by the global community over the issue…How can the global community remain silent when eight million people are being treated worse than animals?…I am disappointed by the international community. If eight million Jews were put under siege…you can imagine the action…The only reason why Kashmiris are subjected to this is, they’re Muslims. Over one billion Muslims are watching this unfold. But where is the world community?…This will have repercussions and will create radicalization…This is the time not to appease but to take action…Islamophobia is creating divisions, hijab [Scarf] is becoming a weapon; a woman can take off clothes but she can’t put on more clothes…It started after 9/11 and it started because certain western leaders equated Islam with terrorism…inaction by the international community, particularly of the US-led West’s major powers who have financial interests in India, could lead to conventional war which could be culminated into nuclear war between the two countries”. Nonetheless, despite perennial phony global war on terror and the New World Order which resulted into New World Disorder, some other developments disappointed the Israelis and the Khazarian Jewish Mafia. In this connection, Senate’s resolution against Trump regarding withdrawal of American-backed Saudi war in Yemen, which has, rapidly, increased the cost of war, bringing about multiple internal crises, affecting the ordinary Americans and Western citizens, particularly those of Europe might be cited as example. Especially, President Trump admitted on October 9, 2019 that Washington has wasted $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East. While speaking regarding the invasion of Iraq, Trump lamented that thousands of American soldiers died or were wounded in the conflict, which took millions of lives on the other side. In fact, America spent a hefty amount on global war on terror, prolonged war in Afghanistan, support to rebels in Libya and some other countries such as Somalia, Philippines etc. Some latest developments are also notable in this regard. On October 9, 2019, Turkish military forces launched ‘Operation Peace Spring” and invaded northeast Syria to push Kurdish militants from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) away from border areas. After the condemnation of the major Western powers, including America and interference of the United Nations Security Council which cautioned against the risk of dispersion of Takfiri terrorists—undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS, the Vice President of the US Mike Pence said that on October 17, 2019, Washington and Ankara have agreed on a five-day ceasefire. Pence elaborated that Turkey would pause its offensive for 120 hours in order to allow the Kurdish Protection Units to pull 30km back from the Turkey-Syria border. Once the withdrawal is complete, “Operation Peace Spring” will be halted entirely. He added that Washington will impose no further sanctions on Turkey once the ceasefire is implemented and it would also withdraw existing sanctions once the Turkish military operation is completed. However, it indicates contradictory strategy of the President Trump, as he had decided to withdraw American forces from Syria. He had imposed additional sanctions on Turkey in connection with latter’s offensive of Syria against the Kurds. At the same times, he had stated that he wanted diplomatic solution of the crisis, while offering his services for arbitration. Notably, President Donald Trump who was acting upon war-mongering policy against Iran in the aftermath of September 14, 2019 drone attacks on key Saudi oil installations, for which both Washington and Riyadh blamed Tehran despite the denial of the latter and acceptance of the claim by Yemen, Trump agreed with the Premier Imran Khan’s offer to mediate the crisis between the US and Iran and between Saudi Arabia and Iran, as decided during the second meeting between Trump and Imran. For this purpose, Imran Khan visited Tehran on October 13, this year and met Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. Despite a mysterious attack on Iran’s oil tanker, Rouhani gave a positive response to Imran. In this context, Prime Minister Imran also reached Saudi Arabia on October 15, 2019 as part of his initiative for reconciliation, where he met King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman Al Saud. But, Trump Administration wants to keep the so-called threat and phobia of Iran on Saudi Arabia so that Riyadh kept on buying American weapons and arms. Taking advantage of Saudi Arabia’s weak military capacity, on October 11, 2019, the Pentagon announced the deployment of a large number of additional troops as well as equipment in Saudi Arabia. While, during his trip to the Middle East on May 21, 2017, Saudi King Salman and Trump signed a defense deal of nearly $110 billion agreement to bolster the military capabilities of Saudi Arabia. Trump’s key aim of such arms deals which also include some other Arab countries like Qatar is to promote the financial interest of the KJM. Besides, Tel Aviv wants to intensify the new Cold War between the US-led West and Russia by manipulating especially America-Russian differences over Ukraine and Venezuela so as to avoid the two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, as some European countries have also been emphasizing on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop the expansion of West Bank settlements and restart a negotiation process for the two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian issue in wake of the debate between the Zionists and non-Zionist Jews in relation to the two-state solution of the issue. Now, Israel and Zionist Jews have no option except the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. On the other hand, Indian Prime Minister Modi also has no other option except the solution of Kashmir dispute. Therefore, Khazarian Jewish Mafia aligned with the Indian extremist rulers who are dividing the world on religious lines, will prefer a major war between the Western Christian World and the Islamic World. Terror attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15, 2019 by Australian man, namely Brenton Tarrant who opened indiscriminate fire at Muslim worshippers killed 50 Muslims. Online reliable sources confirmed Israeli connections of Tarrant. Four mosques in the British city of Birmingham were damaged overnight on March 21, this year in a spate of Islamophobic attacks. Intelligence services of the New Zealand and the UK have been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists which have been encouraged by the KJM. And New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern surprised the other Western countries by taking very positive steps in favour of the Muslims. Hence, especially Mossad can again target New Zealand’s Muslims. It can also use ISIS terrorists to conduct more terrorism related assaults in this country or any Western-European country in order to ensure ‘clash of civilizations,’ between the Western and the Muslim worlds. However, false flag operations keep on going the Western countries and elsewhere in the world. Another regrettable point is that by pursuing the duplicity of the Khazarian Jewish Mafia, irresponsible attitude of Indian, Israeli and some Western politicians has introduced dangerous socio-religious dimension in their societies by equating the “war on terror” with “war on Islam” and acts of Al Qaeda and ISIS with all the Muslims. Their media have also been contributing to heighten the currents of global politics on cultural and religious lines with the negative projection of Islam. Owing to these reasons, far right-wing parties and “Stop Islam” movement in the West, particularly in Europe has been becoming popular by largely attracting their people. Right-wing parties in a growing number of European countries have made electoral gains. The right-wing parties range across a wide policy spectrum, from populist and nationalist to far-right neofascist. In order to obtain their sinister designs, Mossad, Indian RAW and CIA operatives have also been assisting ISIS, Al Qaeda and similar terror outfits which have accepted responsibility in relation to various terrorism-related attacks on Christians in Egypt and some African countries, including some Western countries. It is because of anti-Muslims developments that a greater resentment is being found among the Muslims and peace-loving Christians who think that President Trump in connivance with the Indo-Israeli lobbies is sponsoring state terrorism, directly or indirectly from Kashmir to Palestine. Emboldened by the KJM-led President Trump, both Tel Aviv and New Delhi have been equating the ‘wars of liberation’ in Palestine and Kashmir with terrorism. Their main purpose is to divert the attention of the West from their own state terrorism, while employing delaying tactics in the solution of these issues. Although in the present world of social media and internet, Machiavellian politics of the past has been replaced by modern trends such as fair-dealings and reconciliation, yet by following the old strategies, Khazarian Jewish Mafia has been practicing the most horrible form of colonialism and neo-colonialism, while employing ruthless techniques of terrorism by assisting the militant groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS which conducted various terrorism-related attacks in the US, Europe and other Western countries, including Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Indonesia, Philippines etc., and some African countries. Thus, they massacred thousands of persons which also include Christians. It is due of the flawed internal and external policies, especially a prolonged war in Afghanistan and continuous war on terror that America is facing multi-faceted crises which have been accelerated under the presidency of Donald Trump. Besides, Trump’s extremist and racist policies have accelerated the domestic extremism in the US, which will take the country to the “state of nature” when there was a “war of all against all”. In America, CIA, FBI and Department of Homeland Security which are working as “states within a state” or “shadow Governments” or “Deep state means,” are also clandestinely working against one another. They do not respond to the civilian political leadership-the President and the Congressmen which are also fighting a war of nerves against each other. So, domestic extremism in the US may result into a civil war in the country. In these terms, cognitive dissonance of the President Trump has continued unabated. In the recent past, he said that he would withdraw the US forces from Afghanistan after reaching an agreement between the US officials and Taliban representatives who were negotiating at Qatar. But, he suddenly cancelled the talks. But, during his meeting with P.M. Imran, he requested him to mediate between America and Taliban so that the US could withdraw its forces from that country, which is rapidly increasing American cost of war. Likewise, sometimes, President Trump wants to continue trade wars, especially against China and sometimes, he states that he wants a positive deal with Beijing after negotiations which are under process. It is also true in case of North Korea and the Middle East where Donald Trump is pursuing contradictory policies. As already mentioned that Trump had abruptly announced to withdraw American forces from Syria and he had imposed additional sanctions on Turkey in connection with latter’s offensive of Syria against the Kurds, while stating that he wanted a diplomatic solution of the crisis, offering his services for mediation. President Trump whose policies are unpredictable has become more confused due to the prospective ‘impeachment’ and hence, he can take any risky move inside America or abroad, which can further increase unrest in the US, in the Middle East and probably in the entire world. At present, fanatic leaders are in power in the US, India and Israel, their collaboration with the Khazarian Jewish Mafia may culminate into ‘clash of civilizations’, particularly between the Muslim and the Christian worlds. Their nefarious designs may also result into nuclear war between the US-led West and Russia or between America and Russia or between Pakistan and India. These dangerous conflicts will envelop the entire world and will bring about unimaginable destruction which will eliminate the all human beings. Although Khazarian Jewish Mafia’s cognitive dissonance is bringing about its demise, yet question arises on whom the Khazarian Jewish Mafia will rule when the whole world would be destroyed. Therefore, it is the right hour that loyalist Americans, non-Zionist Jews and peace-loving citizens of every other religious community must play their positive role for global peace by stopping the division of the international community on religious and cultural lines. Note: I have taken points from my related articles and vital points updated. Sajjad Shaukat writes on international affairs and is author of the book: US vs Islamic Militants, Invisible Balance of Power: Dangerous Shift in International Relations Email: [email protected] Addendum I Covert War Between Russia and Khazarian Jewry The precursor to the ongoing covert hybrid WW3 has its colorful beginnings in the Kingdom of Khazaria, a Turkic empire which had its epicenter center in what is now known as Ukraine. Khazaria was ruled by an evil king, who had practiced Babylonian black arts, with the occult oligarchy serving as his court. Khazarians become known to surrounding countries as thieves, murderers, road bandits, and for assuming the identities of those travelers they murdered as a normal occupational practice and way of life. 800 AD – The Ultimatum is delivered by Russia and other surrounding nations The leaders of the surrounding nations, especially Russia, have had so many years of complaints by their citizens that, as a group, they deliver an ultimatum to the Khazarian king. They send a communique to the Khazarian king that he must choose one of the three Abrahamic religions for his people, and make it his official state religion and require all Khazarian citizens to practice it, and socialize all Khazarian children to practice that faith. The Khazarian king was given a choice between Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The Khazarian king chose Judaism, and promised to stay within the requirements laid out by the surrounding confederacy of nations led by the Russian czar. Despite his agreement and promise, the Khazarian king and his inner circle of oligarchs kept practicing ancient Babylonian black-magic, also known as Secret Satanism. This Secret Satanism involved occult ceremonies featuring child sacrifice, after “bleeding them out”, drinking their blood and eating their hearts. https://geopolitics.co/2015/03/11/hidden-history-of-the-incredibly-evil-khazarian-mafia/ As opposed to most peoples today, the remnants of Khazaria don’t let bygones be bygones. They have been preparing for the big war. They have been infiltrating all of the institutions of the world. The deep dark secret of the occult ceremonies was that they were all based on ancient Baal Worship, also known as worship of the Owl. In order to fool the confederacy of nations led by Russia that were watching Khazaria, the Khazarian king melded these Luciferian black-magick practices with Judaism and created a secret Satanic-hybrid religion, known as Babylonian Talmudism. This was made the national religion of Khazaria, and nurtured the same evil that Khazaria was known for before. Sadly, the Khazarians continued their evil ways, robbing and murdering those from surrounding countries who traveled through Khazaria. Khazarian robbers often attempted to assume their identities after they murdered these visitors, and became masters of disguises and false identities — a practice they have continued even to this very day, along with their child-sacrifice occult ceremonies, which are actually ancient Baal Worship. https://geopolitics.co/ Today, they are everywhere, and Russia’s battle is ours, too.

Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is.” – Winston Churchill The current conflict between the US and Russia is due to one simple reason: the Ashkenazim. They have a debt to settle with Russia. Allow us to forward a bit of chronological tables as we delve into the nitty-gritty behind the conflict. The Ashkenazim are the descendants of the Gentile (Goy) Ashkenaz, the Japhetite. “The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Javan… The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.” Genesis 10:2,3 “By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands.” Genesis 10:5 They are a resilient, roaming Turkic people. They have a knack for reinventing themselves. They first surfaced in world annals as the notoriously barbaric Scythians or Sakadeans, depending on regional phonetic. “Here there is no Gentile or Judahite, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.” Colossians 3: 11 The word Scythian or Sakadean comes from the word Saka – with its Iranian verbal root Sak, meaning to roam. The Scythians settled Central Eurasia which they conquered with their Gentile brother Togarmath and various other cousins, expanding across a vast track of land that encompassed but was not limited to parts of present-day Turkey and Iran. Their Gentile brother Riphath along with their uncle Javan’s descendants settled in Greece. Later on, they reinvented themselves and settled a land they would call Khazaria – from the word Qasar, with its Turkic root Qaz, meaning to roam – following the break-up of the western Turkish Steppe Empire. Then the country converted en masse to Judaism/Pharisaism, sometime between 740 and 920 AD, just so they could remain independent of the two competing empires of that time, Christianity and Islam. “Judaism was the most actively proselytizing religion…The most significant mass conversion occurred in the 8th century, in the massive Khazar kingdom between the Black and Caspian seas,” explained Jewish historian Shlomo Sand. Then, Sviatoslav I of Kiev destroyed Khazaria around 1048 and absorbed it into Kievan Rus’, a territory that would later become part of the Russian Empire. In Imperial Russia, the Ashkenazim were kept under tight control and enclosed in the Pale of Settlement. Something the Ashkenazim never forgave Russia. Biding their time, they nurtured their hatred and plotted their revenge along with a new reinvention. They became the power behind the heinous Bolsheviks who took over the Russian government in the 1910s, killed 66 million Christians, including 200,000 members of the Christian clergy, and destroyed 40,000 churches. “You must understand, the leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse. It cannot be overstated. Bolshevism committed the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime is proof that the global media is in the hands of the perpetrators,” explained famed Christian Russian writer Alexandr Solzhenitsyn. Solzhenitsyn with Putin The great majority of these vicious Bolsheviks were Ashkenazi Jews such as Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trosky, Lev Kamenev, Gregory Zinoviev, Yakov Sverdlov, and Grigory Sokolnikov. They were financed by Ashkenazi bankers from New York and London, such as Rothschild Bank and Jacob Schiff of Kuhn and Loeb & Co., who themselves championed the destructive ideology of the Ashkenazi Karl Marx, and found it profitable to invest in Communism’s disastrous conquest of Russia, while making a few bucks in the process by plundering the country via well placed agents who would later be known as “oligarchs“. Russia’s entire Soviet Empire collapsed in 1991. Thus the Ashkenazim succeeded in bringing Russia to its knees. Revenge Round 1. Done. Khazaria overlapped Ukraine & Crimea Today, Russia is under fire for the conflict in Ukraine. A conflict that was started by the neocon Ashkenazi Victoria Nuland in the US State Department, with her neocon Ashkenazi husband Robert Kagan working in the background via powerful organizations such as Project for a New American Century, the Brookings Institution, and Council on Foreign Relations. The Ashkenazi George Soros also contributed financially to the Ukrainian Maidan “Revolution”. “Many of the participants in Kiev’s ‘EuroMaidan’ demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by Soros’ International Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given ‘more than any other donor organization’ to ‘democratic transformation’ of Ukraine,” wrote William F. Jasper in The New American. In other words, the Ashkenazim or the Jewish neocons are goading the Russian bear by wagging the American dog. The dog can’t really decline because AIPAC has it by the groin, bribing equally both the Republicans (Trump included) and the Democrats, who are nothing but political whores willing to betray their country and risk the peace of the world. And remember, AIPAC is controlled by powerful Ashkenazi-American business leaders. See How the Ashkenazi Jews conquered the West. Their sole purpose is to destroy Russia once again by starting a fire in its underbelly, Ukraine. A fire they’re planning to spread into Russia proper via military and economic warfare. Why? Because Russia has had the gall to rise from its still warm Ashkenazi-induced ashes. And because Russia has had the temerity to arrest their well placed thieving agents known as “oligarchs”, with some fleeing the country. And because Russia has had the audacity to impede the American war on Syria, which was orchestrated by AIPAC for the benefit of Israel. Revenge Round 2. In progress. After the destruction of Khazaria, the Ashkenazim scattered East and West throughout Europe and reinvented themselves as Errant Jews or Wandering Jews – meaning Roaming (Khazarian / Sakadean or Scythian) Jews. That label had nothing to do with a longing for Palestine but a longing for Khazaria or perhaps a longing for a new land, any new land. Here’s an excerpt from Wikipedia: In 1903 Theodore Herzl presented the British Uganda Program at the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel. In the late 1930s, the British Zionist League considered a number of other places where a Jewish homeland could be established. The Kimberley region in Australia was considered until the Curtin government (in office: 1941–1945) rejected the possibility. With the support of the then Premier of Tasmania, Robert Cosgrove (in office from 1939), Critchley Parker proposed a Jewish settlement at Port Davey, in south west Tasmania. Parker surveyed the area, but his death in 1942 put an end to the idea. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast set up in the Russian Far East in 1934, represented a Soviet approach to providing a Jewish homeland. In the wake of World War 2, a great number reluctantly assimilated themselves throughout the Americas. However, the great majority migrated to Palestine where they created many terrorist groups such as the Irgun, the Stern gang, and Haganah. They terrorized the Palestinian population, killed thousands upon thousands, and forced hundreds of thousands out of their homes and into neighboring Arab countries. Consequently, they stole Palestine and renamed it Israel in order to reinvent themselves as Hebrews and hoodwink gullible Christians in the West. “It is certain that there is no ethnic or racial continuum between the Biblical Israelites and the (Ashkenazic) Khazarians who lead the Jewish state,” explained Gilad Atzmon, Jewish writer and musician. In their adoptive countries outside of Israel, including the US and Europe, the Ashkenazim have become financial and influential powerhouses, not because they’re Jews – at heart the majority of them are really not religious at all and couldn’t care less – but because they’re a shrewd people. They have learned much from their roaming throughout history, and they assimilate themselves fast and hard. They’re the ultimate Nomads. Was this on Putin’s mind? Now could it be that, after two successive ideological failures in the forms of Communism and the current slow-motion destruction of Zionism in Israel, somewhere deep inside the minds of die-hard Ashkenazi leaders lies a plan for a new reinvention? Will that reinvention be the re-conquest of their Khazar Khaganate – a land that is situated deep inside Russia and encompasses Ukraine and Crimea? Is that why Putin suddenly reattached Crimea to Russia? Could it be that the Ashkenazim’s plan is to take back and re-settle their ancient Khazaria after the Downfall of Apartheid Israel? Is it why the duly elected President of Ukraine was forcibly removed in order to install a puppet government with a new Prime Minister named Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who according to The Guardian is playing down his Jewish roots (Arseniy Yatsenyuk was recently replaced by another Jew, Volodymyr Groysman)? Will they be okay with just Ukraine? Revenge Round 3? If so, prepare for World War 3. “I saw the prosperity of the wicked… Their strength is firm… Pride serves as their necklace; Violence covers them like a garment… This is what the wicked are like—always free of concern as they go on amassing wealth... Surely (Lord) You place them on slippery ground… How suddenly they fall and are destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!” Psalm 73:2,4,6,12,18,19 “We Jews, we, the destroyers, will remain the destroyers forever.”– Maurice Samuel Bolshevik Revolution: The Jewish Bolsheviks who took over the Russian government in the 1910s, killed 66 million Christians, including 200,000 members of the Christian clergy, and destroyed 40,000 churches. World War 1: Britain was losing the war against Germany. The Zionists stepped in and bribed President Wilson to get the US into the war to help them. In return, the Jews asked the British Empire to deed them Palestine to create Israel. Their wish was granted in the form of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which cost the world 18 million dead. World War 2: The Zionists fomented that war (just like they’re doing today with Iran and other countries in the Middle East), so that European Jews could feel threatened. The deception worked as European Jews fled in droves to Palestine and took over the homes of Palestinians, who were evicted at gunpoint and then either massacred or driven out of their land into neighboring Arab countries. With enough Jews on the ground, Israel was created in 1948 at a cost of 80 million dead. World War 3: Will the Zionists succeed in bringing the world once again to the brink of disaster to create Greater Israel? If they do, will it instead bring about their downfall? Apartheid Israel is truly a scourge. A cancer that needs to be dealt with. Appeal: Every conscientious individual should implement a personal boycott of Israel and everything made there. https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/the-truth-about-the-conflict-with-russia/ This ancient practice of “virgin offerings,” which continue even today, is based on Baal Worship, or the Worship of the Owl. The Worship of the Owl is the key ritual at the Bohemian Grove where most leaders of the United States congregate to plot the direction of their rule. Can you see the Big Owl in Washington DC? We have also seen how ISIS destroyed all of the ancient relics in Palmyra, Syria, which included the UNESCO protected Arch of Triumph, or Baal Shamin, “a temple dedicated to worshiping the Phoenician god of storms and rainfall…” https://www.rt.com/news/335619-syria-unesco-heritage-damage/ … only to find them displayed in New York, UK and recently Saudi Arabia. A recreation of Palmyra’s Arch of Triumph was unveiled in New York on Monday, almost a year after Islamic State militants destroyed the original structure. A recreation of the Palmyra arch, a Roman arch destroyed by Isis, goes on display at City hall Park in New York Photograph: Raya Jalabi for the Guardian The 1,800-year-old Roman arch was blown up by the extremist group last October, but a team of archeologists at Oxford University’s Institute for Digital archeology (IDA) set about recreating it, in an act of resistance to Isis’s rampant acts of cultural destruction in Iraq and Syria. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/palmyra-arch-syria-new-york Obviously, they don’t have to carry it over to France. As an aside, recent medical research has found out that injecting blood from teens reverses aging, which should explain why children continue to disappear around the world even today. Injecting blood from young people into old mice improves the mice’s brain power and leads to increased physical activity, according to new research. The finding could lead to breakthroughs for people suffering from degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease. The findings, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, were presented at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego, California on Monday, the New Scientist reports. http://myeclinik.com/injecting-old-mice-with-blood-of-teenage-humans-reverses-aging-study/ We don’t have to resort to cannibalism and suck in some amounts of blood from some virgins just to reclaim our youth. Just read the entire linked article, when you have the time, as the real science behind the anti-aging effects is laid in simple terms. The destruction of the old Baal tower in Palmyra only suggests that some Jewish benefactors of ISIS don’t want the Syrian people to remember that they were once part of the tradition. The Goyim must be restricted to the religion of subservience, of self-sacrifice, that is fundamentally embedded in the Catholic doctrine, while they, the Rulers of the World, continue to live and worship Baal, the two towers of Hegelian Dialectic, to pit everyone against each other, to divide and conquer the people for all eternity, neither of which should led to enlightenment and the freedom of the individual. Although Putin can be seen inside Christian churches lighting candles, or even visited the Pope at the height of the efforts to reform the Vatican Bank in the aftermath of the massive resignations of banking CEOs [here], it doesn’t mean that he is already a conscript like the Pope would have wanted him to be. He is just playing politics like any politicians do. But his Oriental indoctrination should play largely into his decision-making, too. The age-old conflict can only be resolved when one is completely decimated. The ultimate destruction of the world may befall on humanity should they allow the Khazarian Askhenazi Jewry to win. Otherwise, if humanity makes the effort and topple the enemy, only then will man’s horizon could broaden itself and allow the exploration of the unlimited possibilities of his being. . Loading...

According to CNN’s Oscar Holland and Taylor Barnes, researchers discovered the coffins in Al-Assasif, a necropolis on the Nile River’s West Bank. Once part of the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes, the site stands in what is now Luxor. As Lateshia Beachum reports for the Washington Post, the coffins—decorated in shades of red, green, white and black—were found stacked in two layers in a giant tomb. The wooden sarcophagi are particularly impressive due to their colorful, well-preserved paintings and inscriptions, as well as the fact that they are still sealed—a rarity in Egyptian archaeology. Although the antiquities ministry did not specify what time period the sarcophagi date to, BBC News notes that the majority of tombs in the necropolis hold the remains of nobles and government officials buried during Egypt’s Late Period, which lasted from 664 to 332 B.C.

    "description": "The source of the world's problems: The Gentile \"leadership\" has been chosen for its willingness to sell its soul to Cabalist central bankers by joining Freemasonry, which is Judaism for Gentiles.",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis and Henry Makow Henry Makow received his Ph.D. in English Literature from the University of Toronto in 1982. As we have demonstrated in the past, any categorical and metaphysical denial of the moral order will inexorably lead to radical deceptions and sometimes covert operations. Freemasonry, as a secret society and judaizing movement, is not only part of those deceptions but is congruent with Jewish magic and mysticism.[1] Only those in the upper echelon actually know what is exactly going on. As Jones documents, “The deeper the adept penetrates, the more Talmudic are the mysteries revealed to him. The Rosicrusian, for example, is taught the inscription INRI which was nailed to the Cross means not Iesus Nazarensis Rex Iudeorum, but rather the ‘Iew of Nazareth Led into Iudea,’ a reading which deprives Christ of his divinity and reasserts the Talmudic calumny that Christ was a common criminal who deserved to be executed: “‘As soon as the candidate has proved that he understands the Masonic meaning of this inscription INRI, the Master exclaims, My dear Brethren, the word is found again, and all present applaud this luminous discovery, that—He whose death was the consummation and the grand mystery of the Christian Religion was no more than a common Jew crucified for his crimes.’ “To be initiated into the higher degrees of Freemasonry, the adept must agree to become an assassin of the assassin of Adoniram. He must be willing to assassinate Christ and his representatives on earth. The revolutionary intent of Freemasonry becomes clear when the adept is informed that he must be willing to kill the king. Mystical Masonry is synonymous with Revolution. ”[2] Quoting Barruel, Jones writes, “When the adept sallies forth from the cavern with the reeking head, he cries Nekom (I have killed him)…. “The adept is informed that till now he has only been partially admitted to the truth; that Equality and Liberty, which had constituted the first secret on his admission into Masonry, consisted in recognizing no superior on earth, and in viewing Kings and Pontiffs in another light than as men on a level with their fellow men, having no rights to sit on the throne, or to serve at the altar, but what the people had granted them.”[3] What a coincidence that Aleister Crowley, a 33rd degree mason who ended up having a master effect on pop music, who held “group orgies” as part of his regular rituals (including small children), and who ended up influencing sex perverts such as Alfred Kinsey,[4] also performed similar rituals. Some scholars would point out that “Rosicrucianism played an important role in the formation of Freemasonry.”[5] If that is the case, then we have another piece of evidence on our hands which clearly indicates that a marriage between Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism is almost unavoidable. Both Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, at their eventual root, sought to denigrate and attack Logos and this was very important during the French Revolution. Since that was the case, again the marriage between the French Revolution and Jewish movements were two sides of the same coin. Isaac M. Wise wrote in 1866 that “Masonry is a Jewish institution, whose history, degrees, charges, passwords and explanations are Jewish from beginning to end.”[6] Henry Makow will enlighten us more on this issue. Henry Makow: The source of the world’s problems: The Gentile “leadership” has been chosen for its willingness to sell its soul to Cabalist central bankers by joining Freemasonry, which is Judaism for Gentiles. Architects of Deception, (2004) a 600-page history of Freemasonry by Estonian writer Jyri Lina offers profound insight into the true character of modern history. Essentially, a dominant segment of Western society has joined the Khazarian financial elite in embracing Freemasonry, a satanic philosophy that represents a death wish for civilization. They imagine somehow they will profit from the oppression, lies and suffering caused by their Communist “New World Order.” Incredible, bizarre and depressing as it sounds, Lina writes that 300 mainly Jewish banking families have used Freemasonry as an instrument to subvert, control and degrade the Western world. This view is consistent with the 1938 NKVD interrogation of an illuminati member who names many of these banking families and confirms that Freemasons are expendable tools. Based on the archives of the powerful French Grand Orient Lodge, captured in June 1940 and later made public by the Russians, Lina details how Freemasonry has conspired for world domination and orchestrated all major revolutions and wars in the modern era. (Lina, p.332) Masons, often Jewish, are responsible for communism, Zionism, socialism, liberalism (and feminism.) They love big government because it is the ultimate monopoly. “World government” (dictatorship) is the final trophy. This is the vision behind 9-11 and all wars. These “world revolutionary” “progressive” movements all mirror Lucifer’s rebellion against the laws of God and nature which is at the heart of Freemasonry. They ensnare millions of gullible idealists by promising a utopia based on materialism and “reason” and dedicated to “liberty, equality and fraternity,” “public ownership” or some other idealistic sounding claptrap. It’s called bait-and-switch. According to Lina: “The primary aim of modern freemasonry is to build the New World Order, a spiritual Temple of Solomon, where non-members are nothing but slaves [and] …where human beings would be sacrificed to Yahweh.” (52) Lina cites numerous Jewish sources that claim Freemasonry is based on Judaism and is “the executive political organ of the Jewish financial elite.” (81-83) The common goal of these Masonic inspired movements is to undermine religion, nation and family by promoting social division, self-indulgence and “tolerance” i.e. nihilism, globalism, sexual “liberation” and homosexuality thereby reducing humanity to a uniform dysfunctional and malleable mush. Lina and others who attempt to alert humanity to its real condition are routinely slandered as anti-Semitic, fascist, and right wing “haters” by people indirectly employed by the bankers. This tactic shields the conspirators from scrutiny and makes discussion of our grim predicament impossible. I am a Jew. I am not part of this banking monopoly, nor is the majority of Jews. By way of analogy, the mafia is considered mostly Italian but most Italians do not belong to the mafia. On the other hand, Italians don’t viciously attack opponents of organized crime and call them “racists” and “hate mongers”. That would look awfully suspicious. Jews compromise themselves by their defense of the Masonic Jewish bankers and their perverse vision for humanity. The Khazarian Ideology We cannot understand the modern world unless we appreciate that it is the result of the Masonic conspiracy. People scoff yet the evidence stares them in the face every day. Lina believes, “Freemasonry plays the same role in Western society as the Communist Party did in the Soviet Union. Without belonging to the freemasonry there is no chance of a fast career, regardless of how talented one is.” Keep in mind that Communism was a Masonic enterprise and the puzzle starts to take shape. Lina says Freemasons not only control politics but also virtually every sector of Western society, including science and culture. “The present cultural life has become virtually unconscious,” he writes. “We have witnessed the beginning of cultural senility.” (333) In his pamphlet “The Open Conspiracy: Blueprint for a World Revolution” (1929) the Freemason H.G. Wells describes an “open secret society” consisting of society’s leading men operating as a hidden force to secure world resources, reduce population through war and replace the nation state with world dictatorship. (340) MASONIC IDEOLOGY Human beings are naturally attracted to good and repulsed by evil. Thus evil always represents itself as good. To the public, and its own lower ranks, Freemasonry pretends to be dedicated to “making good men better”, humanism, tolerance, and you-name-it. If this were true, would they have to extract vows of secrecy from members on pain of slitting their throat? Would they have been condemned by many Popes and banned from numerous countries? (84) I do not wish to impugn the many good and decent men in the lower “Blue Degrees” who are unaware of Freemasonry’s true function and character. But there is abundant evidence and testimony that Freemasonry is a satanic cult dedicated to the worship of death. (134-138) For example, when the Italian Grand Orient Lodge was evicted from the Palazzio Borghese in Rome in 1893, the owner found a shrine dedicated to Satan. The Italian freemasons published a newspaper in the 1880s where they admitted time and again, “Our leader is Satan!” (135) The Masons also admit to having a revolutionary political agenda. Typical of statements Lina cites from Masonic publications is the following from a German magazine in 1910: “The driving thought is at all times focused on destruction and annihilation, because the power of this great secret society can only rise from the ruins of the existing order of society.” (272) CONCLUSION The Illuminist Conspiracy is the brake responsible for humanity’s arrested development. Mankind resembles a person suffering from a serious disease and sinking into a coma. Juri Lina, left, has written a courageous book to revive us. He says we face “the largest spiritual crisis in the history of mankind…They have taken our history, our dignity, our wisdom and our honor, sense of responsibility, spiritual insights and our traditions.” We are partly to blame, he says: “We have failed to act against the Masonic madness due to our enormous gullibility. We have been totally fooled and ignored the warning signals.” (274) He ends on a hopeful note, saying evil is dysfunctional and inevitably destroys itself. “Freemasonry carries within it the seeds of its own destruction.” (563) Wars, revolutions and depressions are all part of a “revolutionary” process designed to frogmarch humanity to “world government” under the rubric of Freemasonry which may be a surrogate for an alliance of occult Khazarian and gentile financial elites. Their “self-destruction” seems to be our best hope since the public is too feckless and weak to resist.

(Beth Allen) The Man Who Ran a Carnival Attraction That Saved Thousands of Premature Babies Wasn’t a Doctor at All by Claire Prentice /Smithsonian.com Nurses in starched white uniforms and doctors in medical coats tended to babies in glass and steel incubators. The infants had been born many weeks premature and well below a healthy birth weight. Stores didn’t make clothes small enough to fit their tiny, skeletal frames so the nurses dressed them in dolls’ clothes and knitted bonnets. A sign above the entrance read “Living Babies in Incubators” in letters so large they could be read from the other end of the Chicago World’s Fair grounds, which took place over 18 months in 1933 and 1934. The infant incubator exhibit was built at a cost of $75,000 (worth $1.4 million today) and was painted in a patriotic red, white and blue. The men in charge were leading Chicago pediatrician Dr. Julius Hess and Martin Couney, who was known across America as “the incubator doctor.” Martin Couney had run infant incubator exhibits, in which premature babies were displayed to the public, for more than three decades, most famously at Coney Island in New York City.

    "description": "Exhibition explores themes of patriotism, duty & Vietnam War connections to World War I",
    "articleText": "6 Soldiers on search and destroy patrol 1966/Exhibition Images National WWI Museum and Memorial to Host Special Exhibit “The Vietnam War: 1945-1975 Opens Friday, Nov. 8 at National WWI Museum and Memorial KANSAS CITY, MO. – More than 40 years after its conclusion, the Vietnam War remains one of the most controversial events of the 20th century. How did the conflict begin? Why did it begin? What are the connections between the war and its confounding cousin, World War I? The National WWI Museum and Memorial will host the special exhibition The Vietnam War: 1945-1975 beginning on Friday, Nov. 8, 2019 through Sunday, May 31, 2020. From perspectives covering both the home front and the war front, the exhibition explores themes of patriotism, duty and citizenship through a remarkable collection of objects, documents, photographs and more. In conjunction with Veterans Day Weekend (Friday-Monday, Nov. 8-11), admission to the Museum and Memorial is free for veterans and active duty military personnel, while general admission is half-price for the public. Museum and Memorial members can view the exhibition for free during an exclusive preview day on Thursday, Nov. 7 from 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. “We are honored to serve as the only host institution in the Midwest and the final location for this incredibly important and poignant exhibition,” said National WWI Museum and Memorial President and CEO Dr. Matthew Naylor. “Some might wonder why the National WWI Museum and Memorial would host an exhibition about the Vietnam War. As we seek to achieve our mission of informing the public about the Great War’s enduring impact, events that took place in Vietnam are quite connected to and were most certainly influenced by World War I.” The exhibition takes visitors on a journey spanning the duration of U.S. involvement in Indochina, using compelling storytelling, powerful photography and artifacts that tell the deeply personal stories of the men and women who were affected by the war. The Vietnam War: 1945-1975 explores themes through fascinating objects, including a troopship berthing unit, vibrant anti-war posters, artwork by Vietnam vets, a Viet Cong bicycle, the Pentagon Papers and historical film footage. More than 300 artifacts, photographs, artworks, documents, films and interactive digital media help to convey the story. An introductory gallery precedes the exhibition, which features documents and historical research from the collection of the Museum and Memorial, helping to illustrate connections between the Great War and the Vietnam War. At the Paris peace talks in 1919, a young man named Nguyễn Sinh Cung requested audiences with world leaders in an attempt to secure independence from France for what eventually became Vietnam. Denied these repeated attempts, he later forged alliances with Communist-leaning leaders and renamed himself Ho Chi Minh. A bespectacled artillery captain from Missouri, Harry S. Truman said his later decisions were based on his World War I experiences, including providing economic and military aid to France in support of its efforts in Indochina. Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, a young tank captain named Dwight Eisenhower, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, Colonel George C. Marshall and many others deeply involved in World War I had connections to the war in Southeast Asia a few decades later. “The intersections of World War I and the Vietnam War are numerous and extensive,” said National WWI Museum and Memorial Senior Curator Doran Cart. “World War I affected virtually every aspect of human life in some manner for the remainder of the 20th century and beyond. The circumstances surrounding the Vietnam War are certainly no different in that regard.” In conjunction with the exhibition, the Museum and Memorial offers a variety of engaging programs. At 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 12, Professor Emeritus of Military History at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Dr. James H. Willbanks examines the origins of U.S. involvement in a free program titled “Seeds of the Vietnam War.” Additional programs will follow during the exhibition’s run. The exhibition website features a host of supplemental items, including interviews with veterans who served, incredible photographs of the conflict, oral histories from veterans, a family guide for children, curriculum guides for teachers and much more. Additionally, the Museum and Memorial will host the AVTT Traveling Vietnam Wall, an 80 percent scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the Southeast Lawn of the complex from May 14-25, 2020. Visitation of the wall is open to the public. Outside of special pricing during Veterans Day Weekend and Memorial Day Weekend, admission to The Vietnam War: 1945-1975 is $10 for adults, $8 for seniors and military and $6 for youth. When combined with a general admission ticket, admission to the exhibition is only an additional $3. Guests are encouraged to purchase tickets online in advance to avoid lines at theworldwar.org. This exhibition has been organized by the New-York Historical Society with special collaboration of the National WWI Museum and Memorial. This traveling exhibition was made possible with major support from Lockton Companies, the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the human endeavor, Bernard L. Schwartz and the Achelis and Bodman Foundation. The presenting sponsors are Mr. and Mrs. John Kornitzer and Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Smith, while KCPT is the media sponsor.

(Public domain / Wikimedia Commons) Health Editor’s Note: When looking over Alexander von Humboldt’s lifetime accomplishments, I thought he deserved to be either remembered or discovered by VT readers…..Carol Beautiful and insightful, the illustrations of the German naturalist helped shape a new understanding of the world by Greg Miller Smithsonian.com The German naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most celebrated scientists of the 19th century. In 1869, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, 25,000 people gathered in New York’s Central Park to listen to speeches extolling his accomplishments and witness the unveiling of a large bronze bust of Humboldt, who had died ten years earlier. Flags and enormous posters showing Humboldt’s face lined the streets of Manhattan. Similar celebrations took place around the world—in Berlin, Humboldt’s birthplace, 80,000 admirers gathered in the chilly rain to listen to eulogies and songs sung in his honor. It’s hard to imagine any modern scientist achieving such celebrity, and now, 250 years after his birth, Humboldt himself has largely been forgotten by the general public. But as historian Andrea Wulf wrote in her 2015 biography of Humboldt, The Invention of Nature, his scientific legacy lives on in scores of geographic features and place names, from a glacier in Greenland to a mountain range in Antarctica. (The state of Nevada was almost named Humboldt, Wulf writes.) The Latin names of nearly 300 plants and more than 100 animals pay homage to him, including the aggressive, predatory Humboldt squid, which can grow up to eight feet long and weigh 100 pounds.

Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA First World War’s Pompeii: Burial for British Soldiers Found in Flemish Field Daniel Boffey /The Guardian The plot of land – little bigger than two football pitches – has been described as “the first world war’s Pompeii”. But many of the secrets of those who fought and died on this Flemish field are still destined never to be told. At 11am on Thursday, the burial of 13 British and Commonwealth soldiers at Wytschaete military cemetery near Ypres brought to a close a nearby archaeological dig responsible for uncovering the remains of 110 men, an intricate web of trenches and tunnels, and arguably the most comprehensive snapshot of the changing fortunes and horror of the 1914-1918 war. The plot in question, on the edge of the village of Wytschaete, close to the cemetery, repeatedly changed hands through the war and the misshapen jagged land left behind, unusable by farmer or urban planner, meant that archaeologists benefited from it being largely untouched when they arrived in 2018. More than a hundred mourners watched under an autumnal sun as three coffins covered by the union flag, containing the British empire and Commonwealth soldiers found on the field at Wytschaete – Whitesheet to the British troops – were buried side by side.

    "title": "Henry Makow: Bormann supplied Nazi Uranium for US Atomic Bombs",
    "description": "Blowing the Manhattan Project narrative out of the water.........",
    "articleText": "by Henry Makow PhD https://www.henrymakow.com Sealed in cylinders “lined with gold,” was 1,120 pounds of enriched uranium labeled “U235” the fissile material from which atom bombs are made Proof that Martin Bormann was an Illuminati agent and WW2 was a charade is that he arranged for the transfer of advanced Nazi technology to the US at the conclusion of WW2. Bormann was a Cabalist banker agent who subverted the Nazi war effort. Hitler protected him. Both men were German traitors. World War Two was contrived to destroy the Old Order and make way for the New. The Illuminati sacrificed 60 million people to their god Satan. Mankind is satanically possessed by Cabalism. The technology transfer was revealed in the book Critical Mass (1998) by Carter Hydrick. The book has largely been ignored because of its inconvenient truth. Also, Hydrick, a meticulous researcher, did not highlight the significance of his findings as I have. Instead, he focused on the details of US atomic bomb production, Bormann’s movements, the U-234 logbook, etc. to prove his case. Kirkus provides an excellent summary of Hydrick’s book: Loading... A radically revisionist look at the race for the atomic bomb during World War II. “According to conventionally accepted history, the United States was the first country to invent an atomic bomb and, as a result, won the war against the Axis powers. However, author Hydrick argues that the U.S. government was actually unable to produce either enough enriched uranium or the trigger mechanism necessary for a fully functional device. More than 126,000 barrels of nuclear material lie rotting 2,000 feet below ground in a salt mine near Hanover, Germany. Rumor has it that the remains of nuclear scientists who worked on the Nazi program are also there, their irradiated bodies burned in secret by SS men sworn to secrecy. Furthermore, he says, Hitler’s Germany did have enough bomb-grade uranium, but ultimately made a calculated decision that it wasn’t in its best interest to use it, as it would have risked the equivalent of $2 billion on what was at best a Hail Mary pass. Instead, the author writes, Germany intended either to use the completed bomb as leverage in negotiations or to hand it off to Japan. The author asserts that [Hitler’s Deputy] Martin Bormann, did attempt to broker a deal with Japan but eventually secretly arranged to hand the materials over to the United States. In short, this book holds that America lost the arms race, and without Germany’s technological transfer, the consequence might have been a more powerful Soviet Union. In this third edition of his book, Hydrick addresses the criticism that if his account were true, there would have been massive amounts of unspent uranium leftover, although none was ever found. But in fact, he says, 126,000 barrels have been discovered, further confirming his thesis. Hydrick’s theories are as provocative as they are meticulous; unlike other researchers who’ve focused on personal accounts and records in the National Archives, he combed through uranium production records, shipping paperwork, and metallurgical fabrication records that have largely been neglected by others. The ensuing account reads like a gripping drama, although sometimes the overall pace of the story is stymied by long, baroque sentences and a halting prose style. Still, this book marks a turning point in the history of atomic-bomb scholarship, and no future study can credibly ignore its compelling contentions. “A rarity in academic literature–a genuinely original book about a profoundly important topic.” OTHER GOODIES In addition to the enriched uranium, U-234 also carried plans, parts, and personnel to build V-4 rockets, Messerschmidt 262 jets, and even the Henschell 130 stratosphere plane. (p. 294) Project Paperclip, the recruitment of Nazi scientists, was a continuation of this technology transfer. Hydrick says that Buna rubber factory at Auschwitz was actually a plant to enrich uranium. It consumed more electricity than the entire city of Berlin and never produced any rubber. (72) (left, Goebbels and Hitler- The joke’s on you.) He says the sub dropped Bormann off in Spain. The whole operation was disguised as a technology transfer to Japan. Two Japanese naval attaches on board were allowed to commit suicide when they were told the true destination. Hydrick found archival evidence that proves US-Nazi complicity. The US was aware of U-234’s progress and protected the sub. They knew of Bormann’s whereabouts. (270) Hydrick says key documents are missing from the archives he visited. Hydrick concludes: “To believe a great portion of the actions outlined in this book actually occurred, one must believe the United States government in some form and at some high level, was in league with Martin Bormann and those involved in his escape.” (269) Indeed they were. As with Bormann’s rescue from Berlin by the British, the technology transfer was spun as an exchange for Bormann (and Hitler’s?) safety after the war. Borman was an “Allied” agent all along. The Nazis were false opposition. At the top, they were working for the Illuminati bankers who control both fascism and communism. For the Cabalists, war is a revolutionary act because it increases the banker’s power and wealth, undermines civilization, kills people and advances the ultimate goal: replacing God with Satan. It’s “revolutionary” because it turns Reality on its head. Evil is good; lies are the truth, ugly is beautiful and sick is healthy. We have been satanically possessed. Loading...

    "description": "Kammler was declared death after the war but it was never proven that he committed suicide",
    "articleText": "Regnery History The Hidden Nazi: The Untold Story of America’s Deal With the Devil, Dean Reuter. Regnery History. Editor’s Review: This great and very informative and well researched read will give you a view into the untold stories of WWII and the Nazis, General Hans Kammler, someone you probably have not heard of till now. Kammler was acquainted with both Wernher von Braun, Nazi rocket scientist, and SS Chief Heinrich Himmler who was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and a main planner of the Holocaust. Kammler organized concentration camps and slave labor sites and actually changed the design of Auschwitz to increase crowding so disease would spread. Kammler was declared death after the war but it was never proven that he committed suicide. Dean Reuter, Colm Lowery, and Keith Chester have spent decades pursuing the trail of Kammler while discovering documents that have been hidden since the 1940s. It is thought that the real site of Kammler’s death was in the Chech Republic after being in the custody of the United States. Kammler was hidden from public view. One will ask why? Did he cooperate with Nuremberg prosecutors and or was he protected for the knowledge he had of the Nazi rocket program and secret weapons that Germany had developed? This is an in depth look into the life of a Nazi who seemed to disappear into thin air at the end of World War II. Loading... While reading this book you will be witness to: A firsthand interview with Kammler’s son, as he lay on his German deathbed Holocaust survivor, Joseph Gringlas’s testimony of enduring Kammler’s death camps S. government documents proving Kammler was in U. S. custody for months after war’s end and his reported suicide Astonishing and extensive preparations Kammler and others made to establish the 4th Reich Newly unearthed evidence of how far the Nazis had progressed in their nuclear research, information that America were unaware of during the war…..Carol Excerpt: Page 47 Kammler: The Engineer of Efficient Concentration Camps At Auschwitz as elsewhere, Kammler demanded unconditional obedience from his subordinates, insisting his orders by carried out with “prompt and exact execution.” On the very day Bischoff took office, Kammler laid down his exacting expectations. He “Issued a standard plan for the housing of concentration camp inmates,” deciding how many prisoners could be forced into each barrack. Then in a series of twenty-five drawings, he provided the construction specifications for every concentration camp through the Reich. What Henry Ford did for assembly-line mass production of automobiles, Kammler did for Nazi concentration camps, demanding fixed processes and materials to achieve speed and efficiency of scale. About the Authors: Dean Reutter is general counsel, vice president, and director of the Practice Groups of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy. He has overseen criminal investigations for two federal Offices of the Inspector General and was the Editor of Liberty’s Nemesis: The Unchecked Expansion of the State and Confronting Terro: 9/11 and the Future of American National Security. Colm Lowery is an award-winning lecturer in biomedical science at the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland, where he lectures in molecular biology and its application to biowarfare and bioterrorism. He has published over forty peer-reviewed scientific papers, book chapters, and review articles. Keith Chester is an investigative researcher and author. In 1999, he began researching aerial phenomena reported by Allied military pilots during the Second World War, an effort that culminated in the publication of Strange Company in 2007. 2007 was the same year his focus turned to the mystery surrounding SS General Hans Kammler.

    "description": "Ayn Rand, and her Objectivism philosophy, not only promote greed, they also favor the Jewish state of Israel.",
    "articleText": "The religious right has made a virtual goddess out of Ayn Rand (born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum). Rand’s books, in particular The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, promote her open love of greed and selfishness, as well as her deep hatred for altruism. Around the world politicians on the right, particularly in the US, have promoted her Objectivist philosophy and incorporated it into austerity laws and other laws that reward the 1% and punish the 99%, and which are devastating to the working poor. Many people in the religious left believe that Rand’s philosophy is in direct contrast with the teachings of Jesus. (There is a very good chance that Jesus never even existed as a mere human being, let alone as the son of God. Here is a page with two articles, one taking the position that Jesus did exist as a man, and the other that Jesus is pure myth and never existed even as a man.) However, objectively reading the Christian Bible, we see Jesus was not at all the peace and love hippie type the religious left view him as. Regarding greed and selfishness, which in and of themselves prohibits altruism, Jesus was on the same page as Rand. For example, why did Jesus tell people to give to the poor? Was it simply because it is the right thing to do and will help a fellow human being? No. It was because the person giving to the poor will get a much bigger reward from God! This is seen in Matthew 6:1-6 which says that Jesus said (IF Jesus really did exist, he wrote nothing himself and all there is to go on are hearsay statements by the anonymous authors of the Gospels which, at the behest of Roman Emperor Constantine, were voted to be part of the Word of God/the Bible): “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.” The end goal of the above teaching the anonymous author of the Gospel of Matthew attributes to Jesus is a personal reward. This is in line with the Objectivism philosophy started by Ayn Rand, and is based on selfishness and greed. NOTE TO READERS: My writing work is solely crowdfunded via PayPal. Click here to donate>> Thank you. Another Bible verse that is Randian to the extreme is found at Luke 6:38 and has Jesus saying: “Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.” Luke 6:38 not only aligns with Rand and her Objectivism, it is strongly and frequently promoted by Christian prosperity preachers like Joel Osteen and Kenneth Copeland, to motivate the faithful to give to their ministries/businesses to ensure their ability to purchase new jet planes, mansions and $23,000.00 toilets. Loading... One more, among several more, example of Jesus and Ayn Rand being on the same disgusting wavelength regarding greed is found at Matthew 25:14-30. In this ungodly example, Jesus compares God to a greedy bastard who brutally and cruelly punishes a servant/slave for returning the money he left with him without “usury”/interest. Verses 28-30 have Jesus sounding like Ayn Rand. They say that Jesus said: “Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” The above teachings the Bible claims come from Jesus are in sharp contrast to other teachings the Bible claims comes from Jesus. This makes very clear the Bible’s profound ambiguity. The American Founder and Deist Thomas Paine addressed the ambiguity of the Bible in The Age of Reason, The Complete Edition when he wrote, “…the Bible decides nothing, because it decides any way, and every way, one chooses to make it.” Jesus (IF he existed) and Ayn Rand were both Jews. As Jews they favored the Jewish state of Israel. ((It is not intended to claim all Jews favor Israel’s brutality, as Albert Einstein made clear when he wrote, “Should we be unable to find a way to honest cooperation and honest pacts with the Arabs, then we have learned absolutely nothing during our 2,000 years of suffering and deserve all that will come to us.”) The Zionist Christian John Hagee points this out regarding Jesus in his Seven Biblical Reasons Why Christians Should Support Israel. One of the reasons Hagee uses is based on Jesus deciding to help a Roman centurion by healing his servant after Jewish elders told Jesus that the centurion had built a synagogue for them and that he was good for Israel. This story is found at Luke 7:1-10. Ayn Rand, and her Objectivism philosophy, not only promote greed, they also favor the Jewish state of Israel. She supported the Jewish state of Israel’s cruel and expanding occupation of Palestinian land and supported Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A war which was started by Egypt and Syria in efforts to take back the Sinai and Golan Heights from Israel, which were taken in the Six Day War in 1967, a war which Israel started. Now the Ayn Rand Institute, under the direction of its chairman of the board Israeli-American Yaron Brook, is promoting war against Israel’s enemy Iran, just like they did regarding the horrific US war against Iraq. That war, too, was fought for the benefit of the Jewish state of Israel, and for the benefit of greedy and selfish US politicians from both parties who do all they can to please Israel and its powerful lobby. Rand was a blatant hypocrite. For example, she opposed people getting assistance from the government. HOWEVER, when she needed assistance from the government via Social Security, she took it. Her attacks against altruism ring hollow because when she wanted to leave her home in the Soviet Union, she came to a nation that would not exist if it wasn’t for the altruism of many of its founders: America. Based on the selfishness and anti-altruism promoted by Rand, successful people like Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin and George Washington were wrong to risk all they had for the ideal of the American Republic. And other founders who were not wealthy, like Thomas Paine, were wrong to risk what little they had to support the American Revolution and its ideals. She must have really hated Paine, since he gave away his first financial windfall, which he earned with the sale of Common Sense, to the cause of the American Revolution. I’m profoundly thankful America’s Founders were not infected with the kind of thinking Jesus and Rand promoted. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "www.pinterest.com Baby’s Cells Can Manipulate Mom’s Body for Decades by Viviane Callier/Smithsonian.com Mothers around the world say they feel like their children are still a part of them long after they’ve given birth. As it turns out, that is literally true. During pregnancy, cells from the fetus cross the placenta and enter the mother’s body, where they can become part of her tissues. This cellular invasion means that mothers carry unique genetic material from their children’s bodies, creating what biologists call a microchimera, named after the legendary beasts made of different animals. The phenomenon is widespread among mammals, and scientists have proposed a number of theories for how it affects the mother, from better wound healing to higher risk of cancer. Now a team of biologists argues that to really understand what microchimerism does to moms, we need to figure out why it evolved in the first place. “What we are hoping to do is not only provide an evolutionary framework for understanding how and why microchimerism came to be, but also to assess how this affects health,” says lead author Amy Boddy, a geneticist at Arizona State University.

    "articleText": "Photo by Carol Duff Health Editor’s Note: The author of this article is a partner of BizMed which “provides a platform to integrate and facilitate the administration of quality improvement initiatives for office-based practice.” Obviously this article reflects this author’s thoughts but she makes many good, clear points about no matter how righteous it would be for all to have affordable healthcare, it is a job too big for a country to produce and manage and warns that which ever politician is vying for your vote, he or she will not be able to produce such a white elephant. For-profit, investor owned hospitals, big pharma, health insurance companies are all working to throw a wrench into a “Medicare for All” solution to the inaccessibility to health care that many Americans have. If you get cancer, chances are you will not be able to afford care to help you fight it. The previously mentioned industries are spending big bucks to discredit any such concept, of affordable health care. They are spending money that they have robbed Americans of. Americans who are being held hostage by the frailties of the human body. Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, PAHCF, is a dark-money organization created last year to erode public support for “Medicare for All.” My idea would be to drive medical costs downward, very far downward. For instance, one should not have to choose between buying medications or food or paying the rent. Testing, diagnostics, treatments,medical products, medications, etc. should cost of fraction of the bills they now generate. Let’s make getting healthcare a genuine “not for profit” business, you know the opposite of what our war/defense system is. Face it, the human body is frail and subject to every poison, bacteria, fungus, virus out there. We need all the help we can get..Carol Spoiler Alert: Medicare for All Isn’t Going to Happen Trump or someone else in 2020 — it doesn’t matter, according to Margalit Gur-Arie by Margalit Gur-Arie/originally published in KevinMd and now in Medpage Today I am going to make a prediction here. No matter whom we elect in 2020, Bernie or Trump or anything in between, Medicare for All is not going to happen in America. One can run an electrifying campaign on the promise of Medicare for All, or be indignantly against it, but this is pure theater on both sides. I don’t know if God can make a rock so big and heavy that even He can’t lift it, but I do know that the government can make corporations so big and powerful that even the government itself can’t break them. For decades, our government encouraged the healthcare industry to consolidate vertically, horizontally, and obliquely so it can achieve “economies of scale” and, therefore, lower consumer prices. In the last couple of decades, the government also compelled the industry to computerize its operations, because technology makes everything better and cheaper. Once the resulting monopolistic behemoths were summoned into existence, it was time to nationalize the whole lot, into one super monopoly, with super technology and super economies of scale. The only other example of such government monopoly in America is the military. Loading... Obviously, our standing armies must be, by definition, a national monopoly, but note that the Navy is not building its own ships, and the Air Force is not building its own planes, and the Army is not manufacturing tanks. The government is contracting with private suppliers for pretty much everything, from butter to bullets. The military-industrial complex is a network of very large and utterly corrupt contractors for the government, yielding more power over foreign and fiscal policy than Congress, the president, and all citizens put together, while delivering practically nothing either on budget or on time. A powerful military is essential to America’s safety and global success, so we grind our teeth and keep paying. And medical care for hundreds of millions of people is at least as important. I am not entirely sure how people think Medicare for All is going to work. Are you folks envisioning an angry President Bernie dragging Samuel Hazen into the Oval, wagging his finger at him, and making an offer Mr. Hazen cannot refuse? Something like, “I will pay $50 per head and not a penny more, because healthcare is a human right, and if you want to be a disgusting millionaire or billionaire, go write a bestselling book, like I did …”, at which point Mr. Hazen will be hanging his head down in shame and gratefully take the $50 deal. Upon his return to Nashville, Mr. Hazen will immediately schedule book writing workshops for all HCA department chiefs to compensate for cutting all salaries in half. Yeah … no, that’s not how this works. Go ask Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin or General Dynamics or even Boeing or Booz Allen or any other “beltway bandit” how getting money from the Feds really works. There are well-greased revolving doors between the Pentagon and its contractors. There are stock options and executive positions for high-ranking federal employees. There are 535 people in Congress responsible for allocating budgets, and all 535 are for sale. Most of this infrastructure is already in place for healthcare too, and building the HHS Heptagon shouldn’t take very long. The American president has little to no power over federal spending, and even less so when it comes to large procurement contracts, as the current occupant of the White House discovered the hard way, during the Lockheed F-35 kerfuffle. Clearly, large health systems will survive and thrive under a Medicare for All law, but how about private health insurance? Future President Bernie says they will all be banned. Is that so? Currently, a full third of Medicare beneficiaries are insured and “managed” by a handful of large private health insurers. Medicare is paying those private contractors fixed amounts of money per head for their services. Medicaid is doing the same for most of its beneficiaries, and all military health insurance (TRICARE) is contracted out to the usual suspects. Basically, the vast majority of people covered by public insurance are really insured by gigantic insurance corporations. Fact: Under the hood, taxpayer-funded healthcare is the bread and butter of private health insurance companies. When future President Bernie and the hordes of uninformed supporting characters in the 2020 elections festival say that private health insurance will be banned, they are lying to you. What will be banned under a Medicare for All law is your ability or your employer’s ability to purchase health insurance directly from a private company. Instead, the government will procure contracts in bulk as it sees fit, assign people to them as it sees fit, and pay for these contracts with tax revenue as it sees fit. Just like they pay for battleships, fighter planes, bombs, tanks, and such. The U.S. military is known for lots of great things. Value-based purchasing, and cost-effectiveness in general, are not among those things. Depending on whom you ask and what is included in the definition of healthcare, Medicare for All is projected to cost between three trillion and four trillion dollars per year, which is five times the amount we spend on the military. This number is calculated based on costs under current law, minus the waste generated by the cacophony of hundreds and thousands of different insurance plans, different healthcare facilities, and their too-many-to-count service and product vendors. The projections do not include the effects of the inevitable massive consolidation of everything healthcare into a dozen or so federal contractors, able and willing to demand multi-billion dollar contracts for services worth a few million dollars at most on the open market. Remember the Obamacare marketplace website? Multiply that by orders of magnitude, and you have Medicare for All. Medicare for All is as egregious a misnomer for this plan as the Affordable Care Act was. When they say Medicare for All, they mean federal government procured health insurance for all. When they say everything soup to nuts will be covered, they mean everything the heavily indebted federal government thinks should be covered, and can afford to cover, will be covered. When they say healthcare will be better, more plentiful, and much more affordable, they mean please vote for me in 2020. Medicare for All will be built on the largely immovable foundation our government chartered and nurtured for half a century. If you want a glimpse into a Medicare for All future, go look at any Medicaid Managed Care plan in any impoverished southern state, and look at the balance sheets of the associated contractors and sub-contractors. It doesn’t have to be this way. We don’t need to bulldoze over everything we have, and we certainly don’t need to pretend that we can, or that we must. And we need to remember that the proper role of government in a free country is not to manage the health or the care of all its citizens. Free people are not the wards of a State responsible for keeping them healthy, productive, and happy. The role of a democratic government is to keep predators, foreign and domestic, including corporate ones, at bay, while providing a sturdy safety net for the few who cannot care for themselves. Let’s do that instead. It will be better, faster, and cheaper than the fictional construct called Medicare for All. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

(Chokchaloemwong et al., 2019) Newly Discovered Dinosaur Was a Giant ‘Shark Tooth’ Carnivore by Riley Black Smithsonian.com Tyrannosaurs are often seen as the kings of the prehistoric world. They’re among the largest and most charismatic of giant predators to stalk the Earth during the age of dinosaurs. But they weren’t the only voracious giants of the time. The “shark tooth lizards,” known to paleontologists as carcharodontosaurs, ruled all over the planet for tens of millions of years before and during the rise of tyrannosaurs, and a new find in southeast Asia helps fill in the backstory of these impressive carnivores. A new species named Siamraptor suwati was found in the Early Cretaceous rock outcrops of Thailand. Dinosaurs can be difficult to find among the Mesozoic rocks of southeast Asia. Rock layers of the right age and type to find dinosaur bones are less abundant in this part of the world than places like the western United States or China, and those that do exist are often covered by thick forest. Yet, as reported today by Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University paleontologist Duangsuda Chokchaloemwong and colleagues in the journal PLOS ONE, the bones of Siamraptor were found in 115-million-year-old rocks near the Thai district of Ban Saphan.

    "articleText": "www.pinterest.com Health Editor’s Note: We drive along highways and see plastic bags, wounded tires, car bumpers left over from accidents, paper, metal and the thought goes through your head, “why does someone not pick that up?” There are portions of highways and roads that are assigned to organizations or groups who volunteer to pick up the trash and get rid of the pollution. There are signs that tell you that these groups are monitoring for debris. I can remember when it was not uncommon to see someone throw something out of the car window. We developed a name for this discarded waste, litter. We began to make littering illegal but then of course, no one can be watching all the time. How does one clean up pollution and debris that is out in space? Why was it allowed to be there in the first place? When you think of the enormous cost of the things that are sent into space, you would think that someone would want to reclaim/recycle such items.

About 2,000 operational satellites currently zoom around Earth, studying our planet’s weather, beaming down telecommunications data and performing a variety of other tasks. But that number has been rising steadily as the costs of building and launching spacecraft fall, and it’s about to make some big leaps. For example, SpaceX, Amazon and OneWeb all plan to set up internet-satellite megaconstellations in the near future. This past May, SpaceX launched to low-Earth orbit the first 60 members of its Starlink network, which could eventually feature up to 12,000 satellites. But not all of the coming Earth-circling spacecraft will be operated by aerospace professionals working for deep-pocketed companies or government agencies. A fair number will be run by neophytes who just a few short years ago couldn’t have dreamed of being part of the space scene. Loading...

    "description": "\"EVALI\" cases will become increasingly mixed with flu, URIs, CDC warns",
    "articleText": "qz.com Health Editor’s Note: We at VT have been following the progression of illnesses and deaths caused by vaping. The disease has a new name, EVALI, which is an acronym (medicine likes to give longer terms an easier to say name, but also come to think of it, so do other industries), for e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury. With the upcoming fall and winter seasons, the flu and increased upper respiratory infections will be in the symptom mix. EVALI causes damage to the lungs and is not the same as having an infection of the lungs. While injury of the lungs is the end product of this disease, there can be disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting , abdominal pain, and diarrhea which may precede the respiratory symptoms. The health issue right now is to try to cut down on the deaths caused by EVALI and that involves new treatment algorithms to try to stay ahead of destruction of lung tissue. There really is no safe tobacco product….Carol Vaping Illness: A New Name and Expanded Clinical Guidance By Crystal Phend, Senior Associate Editor for MedPage Today If patients have respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, ask about use of e-cigarettes or vaping, the CDC urged. As the number of cases have ballooned to now 1,299 across the nation, experience has grown such that the agency released official interim guidance for clinicians on what it’s now calling EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury). “When we first distributed advice for clinicians back in late August, the guidance was based on limited experience clinicians had caring for a relatively small number of patients,” Anne Schuchat, MD, principal deputy director of the CDC, said on a phone call Friday with reporters, adding, “We are not seeing meaningful dropoff in new cases.” Over the summer, it was easier to distinguish the vaping injury from respiratory infection, but that’s changing as flu season sets in. “It will become increasingly difficult to fully exclude the possibility of infection,” Ram Koppaka, MD, PhD, a medical officer in the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on the briefing call. Loading... Consider “that any given individual may have lung injury, they may have an infection, or they may have both,” he said. “It may be necessary upfront to treat for more than one process at a time while testing is done, while a patient’s course is followed to provide a better indication which of those possibilities is at play.” Among 339 patients with medical chart information submitted to the FDA so far, 95% diagnosed with EVALI initially presented with respiratory symptoms and 77% had GI symptoms, like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some cases preceding the respiratory symptoms. In the document published in Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, the CDC recommended asking patients with such symptoms about vaping along with what types of substances were used (most EVALI has been found in people who vaped THC) and as many specifics about it as possible. While “EVALI is considered a diagnosis of exclusion because, at present, no specific test or marker exists for its diagnosis,” the agency suggested measuring oxygen saturation and vital signs, a respiratory viral panel, and complete blood count and urine toxicology testing, including tests for THC. Along with a chest x-ray looking for infiltrates for all patients with a history of vaping and respiratory or GI symptoms, consider a chest CT for evaluation of severe or worsening disease, complications, or other illnesses, they suggested. Consultation with a pulmonologist would be good, and “there should be a low threshold for consulting with critical care physicians,” the document noted, as 47% of EVALI patients were admitted to the ICU and 22% required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Some patients can be managed on an outpatient basis if they have better than 95% oxygen saturation, are clinically stable, and can assure follow-up within 24 to 48 hours, because some patients with initially mild symptoms rapidly worsened within that time frame. For treatment, consider starting corticosteroids and influenza antivirals, and strongly consider early initiation of antimicrobial drugs for community-acquired pneumonia, the CDC recommendations said. And strongly advise patients to stop vaping and get the flu shot and pneumococcal vaccine, it added, reaffirming it’s advice that everyone — regardless of lung injury — stop vaping THC entirely and consider stopping vaping tobacco as well (13% of EVALI has been in exclusive tobacco vapers). “There’s no safe tobacco product,” Schuchat reemphasized. So far, there have been fewer than five documented cases where patients bounced back to the hospital after discharge, with a range of 5 to 55 days. It’s not clear whether it was due to resumption of vaping, corticosteroid taper, or increased susceptibility to infection, Schuchat said. After discharge, the CDC recommended following up within 1 to 2 weeks with repeat testing. The CDC noted that it is developing ICD-10 codes for EVALI. Loading...

In other words, just the kinds of things that fit the Green Family and Museum of the Bible’s interests. They are part of the Oxyrhynchus Collection, a vast collection of fragments from ancient trash-piles in the city of Oxyrhynchus (modern Al-Bahnasa) in Egypt.

Or the animals used for experiments or entertainment? The World Will Not Go Vegan Overnight As with any product, as the demand for meat changes, production will change to meet market demands. As more people go vegan, there will be more vegan products available in both mainstream stores and health food stores. Farmers will adjust by breeding, raising, and slaughtering fewer animals. Similarly, more vegan products will show up in stores and more farmers will switch to growing things like quinoa, spelt, or kale. If the World Goes Vegan It is conceivable that the world, or part of the world, could suddenly go vegan.

    "articleText": "(Duke University/Douglas Nowacek) North Atlantic Right Whale Mamas Whisper to Their Babies to Keep Them Safe By Jason Daley Smithsonian.com At nearly 50 feet long, North Atlantic right whales are so large that most living things in the sea shouldn’t worry them—but that’s not the case for their babies. Newborn calves are vulnerable to attacks by sharks and orcas. To keep them safe, a new study has found, right whale mamas take things down a notch, “whispering” to their young so they don’t attract any hungry predators lurking nearby. Right whales typically communicate with one another using a vocalization called an up-call, a rising “whoop” sound that can last two seconds and travels very far. With their babies, however, they use a quieter, shorter grunting sound that can only be heard in the immediate vicinity. The new study appears in the journal Biology Letters. “They allow the mother and calf to stay in touch with each other without advertising their presence to potential predators in the area,” lead author Susan Parks, a marine biologist at Syracuse University, says in a press release.

    "articleText": "The Kurdish military Sdf accept truce with Turkey’s withdrawal only. The Us peace-mission pretends a big safe-zone stolen from Rojava by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio for VT Italy Good news comes from Syria but it’s just another lie. The extremist Islamic dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan wanted to make sense of the journey of the American vice president Mike Pence and agreed to a 120-hour truce. First of all it must be said that he did it out of fear. The resistance of the Kurdish SDF militias in the easiest of goals, the city of Rais Al Ain, not far from the Turkish border, was stronger than expected. And according to Kurdish sources the Ankara army would have used white phosphorus ammunitions, which burn the skin with lethal burns on anyone who comes into contact with dust, to terrorize enemies and above all the population that is crying at least fifty deaths. But Erdogan’s cease-fire so far in Syria has only been a strategic solution to give advantage to his allied bastards: the al-Qaeda jihadists who are now reinforced by surviving ISIS commanders as mentioned in various Gospa News reports. read more ERDOGAN ATTACKS ROJAVA FOR HELPING JIHADIST AND ISIS PRISONERS Not only. The aviation of Russia and Syria took control of the airspace over Rojava, the Syrian North East region, thus preventing Turkish jets from covering the advance of the armed forces. The first truce signed by Ankara with Russia and Iran dates back to 17 September 2018 for the province of Idlib. It was never respected. Because the jihadists of various groups, friends and financed by Turkey, have continued to attack and bomb and the Ankara government that, according to the agreements, was supposed to bring out terrorist Islamic extremists from Syria never did. Loading... We arrive today when the US president Donald Trump collects a total rejection from the Chamber of Congress for having withdrawn the Marines from the border between Turkey and Syria, thus opening the door for the Turkish invasion of the Peace Spring operation. read more SARA, THE FIRST CRISTIAN CHILD KILLED BY SHELLS The Pence mission in Ankara makes people who understand a minimum of geopolitics laugh. It seems a diplomatic attempt for cleaning his soul forward many Christians murdered. “The United States will work alongside Turkey, and with nations around the world to ensure that peace and stability are the order of the day in this safe area on the border between Syria and Turkey,” stressed Pence, who also illustrated some details: Turkey – he explained – will obtain a security zone agreed with the US about 32 kilometers beyond its Syrian border. The Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu then clarified that the agreement with the USA constitutes a “pause” of the military operation “Source of peace”, which will turn into a definitive end of the offensive only if the Kurds withdraw entirely, as agreed. “It is not a ceasefire – said Cavusoglu in statements broadcast live on al-Jazeera satellite TV – Turkey will be able to stop the operation only when all the terrorist elements have left the area along the border between Syria and Turkey”. In practice, the Kurds should allow the 32 km for 460 km long, equal to 13,800 kmq of Syrian territory larger than the entire Lebanon, due to a unilateral diplomatic decision. They should give what they are risking their lives for. And the government of Damascus should accept all this. It is clear that this is the umpteenth provocation to tell the world that the US and Turkey are the good ones and that the Kurds, now allies of Syria and Russia, are the villains. A lie that only a moron can believe… Infact, the Bashar Al Assad’s spokeswoman has already told Sputnik International that Syria is neither willing to grant the territory of Rojava to the Autonomous Administration of the Kurds nor to Turkey. read more THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN ASSAD’S ARMY, RUSSIAN AND KURDISH SDF Infact, Mazlu Abdi, SDF commander, replies that Kurdish accept the cease-fire «but not that Turkey remains in the region. They don’t accept an occupation or demographic change» according to Rojava Information Center news (10 pm GMT + 1). Specifying well in a public statement that the truce, to protect civilians and avoid new displaced persons, refers only to the combat zones. Pence takes the lead and tells the world media that “The withdrawal of Kurdish Ypg militias from the border with Turkey has begun”. But no Kurdish source, beginning with the Rojava Information Center (RIC), confirms the news. Indeed at 8.27 pm today (GMT +1) the Ric confirms that fighting continues between the Turkish army and SDF soldiers in Sere Kanye, a place where the Ankara armed forces also bombed Red Crescent ambulances while they were helping the wounded. Erdogan’s dirty double game is always the same: he reaches international agreements as for Idlib with Russia, and today with the US for Rojava, then he waits for his jihadist terrorist friends to launch rockets and grenades on soldiers and civilians, he waits that the Syrian army react to defend itself and therefore feels authorized to resume military operations. read more SYRIAN WAR – DAILY MILITARY REPORTS Dozens and dozens of times have happened to Idlib. I think it will happen again in Rojava with the approval of Pence, who despite being a Protestant politician does not seem to have even spent a word on the Christian children killed by the Erdogan bombs in Qashimli. SARA, BAMBINA MARTIRE IN SIRIA. Cristiani tra due fuochi. Rojava senz’acqua. Autobomba Isis Pure hypocrisy to erase Trump’s shame that he even managed to declare that the Kurds are worse than ISIS. For the USA and CIA, after all, it is true: Al Baghdadi and its Islamic State are their creatures quite controllable. The Kurds no. They are a people that for decades has been looking for a land where they can live peacefully and was used by Washington for its shady business in Syria looking for Middle East dominance and oil stealing.

    "articleText": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have reached a groundbreaking deal with the Assad government. This happened on October 13 evening after the US-led coalition expectedly abandoned their ‘local partners’ in face of Turkey’s Operation Peace Spring and an ‘accident Turkish shelling’ of a US military garrison near Kobani. Turkey is a NATO member state and a key US ally in the eastern Mediterranean. Ankara considers the SDF to be a terrorist group linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. So, it was hard to expect that the US would really fight the Turks on behalf of the Syrian Kurds. Units of the Syrian Army already deployed in Manbij, Tabqah, Tabqah Dam, Ain Issa and other key areas in eastern Aleppo, western al-Hasakah and southern Raqqah. Russia, which was the main mediator between the SDF and Damascus, also sent its military police to Manbij. Official details of the agreement are yet to be revealed and all the sides involved in the northeastern Syria standoff seem to have own versions of events. The SDF and affiliated Kurdish political organizations say that the deal with the Assad government was a least-evil solution and it was related to the defense sphere only. A political agreement still has to be reached and the sides are going to start negotiations in the coming days. SDF sources see Russia as a guarantor of the agreement and the only power that is able to prevent the further Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria. According to this version, the Syrian Army will be deployed along the Turkish border and its presence there will guarantee Syrian territorial integrity. The areas captured by the Turkish military and pro-Turkish groups will remain a zone of military actions until their liberation. They name the liberation of the Turkish-controlled region of Afrin as one of the points of the agreement. Sources close to Damascus say that the SDF will have to hand over to the government the control of oil fields on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. In the political sphere, the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the only real military political power within the SDF, will seek to get recognition of their self-proclaimed Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria by Damascus. The format of this recognition and a possible Kurdish autonomy will depend on the course of negotiations and the development of the Turkish offensive. Loading... The Syrian government has not released official comments on the deal with the SDF so far. The Syrian Army is also not hurrying up to start a fully-fledged war with Turkey on behalf of the SDF. In these conditions, the best strategy is to block directions of possible Turkish-led advance rather than engage the Turkish Army and Turkish proxies in an open battle. This turns the Turkish advance in northern Syrian into a race against time, whose main goal is to capture as much area as possible, while the Syrian Army has not come. The situation in Manbij is a demonstration of this approach: On October 14, the Syrian National Army, a coalition of Turkish-backed armed groups, officially announced the start of advance on Manbij. However, no real advance happened, because the Syrian Army and the Russians came. The Turkish behavior demonstrates that Anakra knows the rules of this game. On October 15, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the operation was ongoing successfully and Turkish forces ‘liberated’ 1,000km2. Erdogan added that his country aims to clear northern Syria of ‘terrorists’ (i.e. Kurdish armed groups) stretching from Manbij to the Iraqi-Turkish border. Nonetheless, this is just an official rhetoric that should not fully comply with the real actions. Turkey will likely gain control of the area between Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, and the M4 highway south of these towns. What really matters is who will get control of the city of Ayn al-Arab (Kobani). In the current conditions, Ayn al-Arab is the only area, where clashes between the Syrian Army and Turkish-led forces can start if they reach it simultaneously. The fate of the town will likely be determined by some kind of behind the scenes deal among Ankara, Moscow and Damascus. At the same time, all the sides will continue to employ their formal rhetoric as if such a deal has never existed. In own turn, US President Donald Trump used the Turkish operation to deliver his repeatedly delayed promise to withdraw American troops from the war-torn country, at least formally. US forces indeed abandoned their military garrisons in northern Syria about 1,000 personnel are withdrawing. However, the reduced contingent of about 150 troops will remain in place in the al-Tanf area as a part of Trump’s anti-Iranian strategy in the region. The US does not want the Damascus-Baghdad highway to be used by Iran to supply its allies in Syria and Lebanon. Additionally, the US-Israeli bloc uses the al-Tanf base to project its power on the Syrian-Iraqi border and monitor supposed Iranian operations in the area. Another factor behind the US move is the need to improve its relations with Turkey. US military support to Kurdish armed groups in Syria used to be a factor of constant tension in the relations between Washington and Ankara. Now, it is removed. A new round of anti-Turkish sanctions announced by President Trump is mostly a formal move aimed at the US internal audience. Meanwhile, the United States and Russia blocked attempts of the UN Security Council to condemn Turkey’s military action in northeastern Syria. If this was really a part of some unpublicized coordination, key powers involved in the conflict may be on the edge of reaching a long-expected wide political deal on settling the conflict in Syria.

    "articleText": "Units of Syrian government troops have entered a strategic Kurdish-populated city in the country’s northern province of Aleppo, amid an ongoing military offensive by Turkish soldiers and allied militants against Kurdish forces in the northern part of the war-battered Arab country. The CIA/MI6 funded fake Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Wednesday that Syrian troops entered Kobani, officially Ayn al-Arab, after militants from the Kurdish-dominated and so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) cut a deal with the Damascus government for army troops to deploy at the border and confront the Turkish military campaign against the Kurds. Earlier in the day, Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Mayadeen television news network reported that Syrian army forces had been deployed in villages in Syria’s northern province of Raqqah. An unnamed field source also told Russia’s Sputnik news agency that Syrian government forces entered the city of Raqqah, the former de facto capital of Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in Syria, for the first time in five years and installed some checkpoints there. Syrian government forces deploy on the outskirts of Tal Tamr town in Syria’s northeastern province of al-Hasakah on October 16, 2019. (Photo by SANA) On Monday, Syrian government forces arrived in the towns of Tabqa, on the outskirts of Raqqah, and Ayn Isa, which served as the headquarters of the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northeast Syria and is located 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the Turkish border. The shift by Kurdish forces under Turkish fire came after President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision in recent days to withdraw US troops from northeastern Syria, leaving Kurdish forces that had allied with the US-led military coalition purportedly fighting the Daesh terror group vulnerable to Turkish offensive. Loading... Later in the day, Syria’s official news agency SANA reported that government forces had entered a number of villages on the outskirts of Tell Tamr town in the northeastern province of al-Hasakah.

(Photo by SANA) Syria troops fight Turkish forces alongside Kurds: SOHR Meanwhile, the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrian army forces have deployed alongside Kurdish forces on the front line in northern Syria. The Britain-based monitor reported on Wednesday that government troops and Kurdish militants were “fighting together” against Turkish-sponsored militants northeast of Ayn Issa. A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on October 15, 2019 shows Syrian army troops posing with a national flag after reportedly completing their deployment in the northern Syrian city of Manbij. The Observatory added that “violent clashes” are underway near the M4 highway, which runs from the western coastal city of Latakia to Saraqib city in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib. “We should end the fighting immediately” Separately, the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said on Wednesday that he had repeated the appeal for fighting to end “immediately” in northeastern Syria. “We obviously concentrated on the situation in the northeast and I repeated the Secretary General’s (António Guterres’) strong appeal that we should end the fighting immediately, that there needs to be a cessation of hostilities, and that we are extremely alarmed by the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and that, we today, have seen already too many people killed and of course more than 160,000 people being displaced,” Pedersen told reporters following talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem in Damascus. The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen (R) meets with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem in Damascus, Syria, on October 16, 2019. (Photo via Facebook) He added, “There is only a political solution also to the crisis in the northeast and we are appealing to all parties to participate in this. We also discussed the launching of the constitutional committee and we had a rather detailed discussion on how we are going to move forward with the launch of the committee by the end of this month.” “I will continue to have discussions with the co-chairs of the government list and the co-chair of the opposition. I must say that so far, the discussions I had here in Damascus and with the opposition in Riyadh have been very good when it comes to launching the constitutional committee. Of course, this hopefully can then be a door opener, as I have said many times, to a broader political process,” the senior UN official pointed out. PressTV-Erdogan: No talks with Syria Kurds until safe zone established President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey’s military operation in Syria’s north will only end when the Kurds leave the region and a “safe zone” is established there. UN Security Council warns of ‘risk of dispersion’ of Takfiri terrorists Furthermore, the United Nations Security Council has cautioned against the risk of “dispersion” of Takfiri in Syria, but stopped short of demanding an end to Turkey’s offensive against Kurdish forces there. “Members of the Security Council expressed deep concerns over the risks of dispersion of terrorists from UN-designated groups, including Daesh,” the Council said in a statement. The members of the UN body also declared themselves “very concerned (about) a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation” in northeastern Syria. In a separate joint statement, the European members of the Council – namely Belgium, Britain, France, Germany and Poland – stressed the necessity of securing camps, where Takfiri terrorists are being held. “The secure detention of terrorist fighters is imperative in order to prevent them from joining the ranks of terrorist groups,” they said. US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft reiterated Washington’s demand for a halt to Ankara’s military campaign in northern Syria. “Turkey’s military offensive into northeast Syria is undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS (Daesh), endangering innocent civilians, and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,” she said. US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Knight Craft delivers a brief statement to the press after a closed Security Council meeting about the situation in Syria, at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, the United States, on October 16, 2019. (Photo by AFP) Craft added, “The United States calls on Turkey to halt its offensive and to declare a ceasefire immediately.” On October 9, Turkish military forces and Ankara-backed militants launched a long-threatened cross-border invasion of northeast Syria in a declared attempt to push Kurdish militants from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) away from border areas. Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984. The YPG constitutes the backbone of the SDF. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

On October 16, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA), recaptured three villages south of the key town of Ras al-Ayn in northern al-Hasakah. Sources close to the Kurdish-led group said that the towns of al-Ahras, al-Rihaniyah and Manajir as well as the nearby grain silos were recaptured from the Turkish-backed National Syrian Army (NSA). The Syrian Arab News Army (SANA) confirmed that the SAA deployed troops inside the newly-recaptured villages. Also: SAA and SDF counter attacking from multiple directions At least 49 militants of the Turkish-backed National Syrian Army (NSA) were killed by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the border town of Ras al-Ayn on October 16, according to opposition activists. The militants were reportedly looting houses inside Ras al-Ayn, in northern al-Hasakah, when they were ambushed by fighters of the Kurdish-led SDF. According to the activists, 40 of the killed militants were members of the Sultan Murad Division while the rest were fighting in the ranks of the Hamza Division. The NSA launched its attack on Ras al-Ayn eight days ago in the framework of Operation Peace Spring. However, the Turkish-backed coalition is yet to make any significant advance within the town. Ras al-Ayn is one of the main targets of the Turkish Operation Peace Spring. The first phase of the operation is aimed at establishing a 120 km long, 30 km deep “safe-zone” between Ras al-Ayn and the town of Tell Abyad to the west.

    "description": "Written by Enkidu Gilgamesh",
    "articleText": "Enkidu Gilgamesh Donald Trump, DIVIDE, RULE & ELIMINATE the Imperial Complex by separating its components! How to save the USA? Article written and submitted by Enkidu Gilgamesh Dear people of USA! The empire was never yours. It was never beneficial for you. It never aimed to spread anything good in the world. Dump it before it dumps you! CONTENT Broader Perspective The Imperial Trap Weakness of the Strangler Fig Tree The Non-Imperial Core The De-Imperialization has begun The Petrodollar Lobby CIA ClimateControl Lobby Savings Separation Cleaning the swamp, ending the bloodshed . 1. Broader Perspective Please consider, even assuming that there was some kind of “peace” by mutual deterrence between the NATO and Warsaw Pact, which was named Cold War, was wrong, as there was always a hot side of that in Latin America, Africa and Asia, particularly Vietnam, Korea, Angola, Afghanistan and other places. It was never about defending the realm of “freedom” but always about global dominance. After the implosion of Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, the US-Empire assumed that it could become the single global power, despite its unfavorable geographic location behind the big oceans and far away from main markets and resources of the world. Because of this disadvantage the efforts to be taken are much higher than for the powers on the right place. It is not a miracle that Russia needs to spend only about $66 billion compared to $700 billion of the US-Empire and about $1000 billion of all NATO members, plus spending for “covert operations” and the spending of the hundreds of billions by Arab countries, which have to finance the imperial first attack forces, which are framed as “Islamists”. With growing resistance, the imperial forces have to multiply their efforts to keep the balance. The land of poker bluffers dreamed of playing on the Grand Chessboard, according Zbigniew Brzezinski, the notorious hater of Russia of Polish origin. He and Henry Kissinger and many other imperialists drove the USA into a quagmire. After some deceiving “success stories”, particularly the blocking of Soviet Union in Iran and its defeat in Afghanistan, these “strategists” were drunk of their victories and lost the connection with the reality. Analyzing the developments more soberly, alternative explanations could be found. Even if they have contributed to that by playing with oil price and sending 10 thousands of terrorists to Afghanistan, the main reason of the Soviet implosion was the inability of the communists apparatchiks to build a sustainable economy. Imperialists don’t get wise by getting old. Brzezinski died by observing the failure in Afghanistan and Iraq and Kissinger is still telling the old stories. When Brzezinski said, seemingly out of wisdom of age, that “Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people. It is easier to kill, than to control…” people like Dick Cheney turned this into “Shock & Awe” by killing as much Iraqis as possible by depleted uranium ammunition and acts of terror. He was followed by Barack Obama, who bragged about being “really good at killing people’ with drones“. The empire became more and more gruesome out of desperation, losing at all fronts. The full roll out of the “Project for a Greater Middle East” by so called “Arab Spring” fake revolutions should be the knock out punch to escape out of this downstream dilemma, but the whole operation shattered at the unbreakable rock of Syria and the imperial hyenas were beaten down by the Syrian, Iraqi, Afghani, Russian and Iranian lions. Men and women of dignity! Never underestimate the historic experience of societies and never take Hollywood scripts for reality. The people of Middle East have seen many wars between former empires, they died under the swords of the Mongols hoards of Genghis Khan and later the of Timur the Lame. . 2. The Imperial Trap At the decline of British Empire the USA came up as a new assumed fair player and triggered expectations which were never fulfilled. Instead the USA took over all bad imperial aspects: imperial wars global drug trade global cooperation with criminal networks However, the seemingly dead British Empire never gave up its strong influence on the finance market, instead it created a shadow banking system in tax evasion paradises and also kept its covert operation abilities. Based on that the USA was never a real empire, because the foundation of all imperial power is the full control on the monetary system, even if we assume that the Federal Reserve is really an US institution and the FED Dollar is the US national currency. The Spider’s Web: Britain’s Second Empire Prof. Werner brilliantly explains how the banking system and financial sector really work. In the case of coup of 1953 in Iran, the Brits also masterly instrumented the USA as their own henchman. However, the USA strategists until this day never understood that they were doing the dirty job for the Brits and it was never in the interest of US-Empire or the USA to threaten and contain Iran. Following the example coup in Iran, the US-Empire made military coups all over the world, installing terror and torture dictatorships. The torture, terror and bloodshed disproved one key expectation from America, the “promotion of democracy”. The failure to rule the world by finance became manifested by depending on drug money during and after the defeat in Vietnam. Since that time one of the main occupations of the CIA is to dominate the global drug and weapon market by cooperation with all kinds of criminal networks. . 3. Weakness of the Strangler Fig Tree Observing the decline and disruption of the current global empire, it is valuable to understand how it may fall apart along the crack-lines of its components. A sociological body is similar to a biological one, it consists of organs and beneficial and damaging parasites. On the way to death the parasitic components get a higher share and dominate the whole body or we may say the formerly “useful” elements become more parasitic. In imperial bodies there is always a self survivable, non-imperial core. Dumping the pure imperial components and letting the core survive should be the main target of the core components. The US-based global empire is a fake one from its beginning in 1913, with the partly move of imperial finance system from London to New York, “by coincidence” shortly before the start of WWI. And it is a walking dead at least since its defeat in Vietnam and the single sided annulment of Bretton Woods System of 1944 in 1971. It is kept on legs by fake money, fake prosperity, fake news, fake business, fake politics, fake economy, fake security, fake alliance and fake governing. The whole imperial system is obviously a deadly dangerous burden for the USA like a strangler fig tree for a host tree! It started small and harmless, promising sweet fruits of “monetary stability” and “economic prosperity”, but it lives from sucking life out of its host! However, the imperial strangler is not like a real strangler tree. It cannot stay on its own body and roots one day without the existence of the USA. Host trees, attacked by such parasites regularly throw off their bark and use the help of symbiotic creatures to eliminate the parasites. It is time for the USA to do the same for the whole live sucking imperial complex. The imperial complex above USA has to be eliminated as it never had any benefit for the USA and was always a burden. Now this burden cannot be carried and cannot fake anything anymore! Even the facade has disappeared! President Donald Trump is IMHO the last chance for dumping the imperial complex before it strangles the USA to death. Killing this POTUS is not an option, like done with Lincoln and the Kennedy brothers JFK & RFK. The imperial system is unable to prolong its fake existence by targeted killing. So let me explain this by dissecting the complexity. . 4. The Non-Imperial Core It is hard to define this, as the foundation of USA was followed by conquering and wars within the current body, what we consider as the United States of America, but I take this as the survivable core and try to define its indispensable components, which are the … constitution of the USA 51 states of the USA the president of the USA developing & producing industry of the USA healthy part of education and science The governmental art of the current President of the USA (POTUS), Mr. Donald Trump, should be to separate save this core from all the imperial elements, at least keep the imperial elements as long as they have still a benefit for the soft transition to the non-imperial statehood. . 5. De-Imperialization has begun! Listen to POTUS Donald Trump! Nothing is left out, nothing can be doubted! He is declaring war against the corrupt establishment! Citing POTUS directly from twitter: POTUS is supporting habitants of the host tree USA to resist against the imperial strangler, which badly abused them for a long time. 29.12.2018: “2018 is being called “THE YEAR OF THE WORKER” by Steve Moore, co-author of “Trumponomics.” It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the “best job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.”“ POTUS is securing the realm to cut the feeding of the imperial parasite, mainly the human and drug trafficking network of the CIA at the borders of the USA. 28.12.2018: “…..close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border……“ 28.12.2018: “….The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a “profit making operation.” We build a Wall or…..“ 23.12.2018: “The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border.

Trump: I don’t want to be in Syria forever, it’s sand & death, not wealth What he did not say in this video is that the US troops were also doing the dirty job for the European Union, because Europe should get a pipeline from Arabia across Syria, preventing the alternative pipeline from Iran and Iraq, which Syria agreed to!

Great things are happening!“ 23.12.2018: “We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill.

Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!“ 20.12.2018: “Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I’ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria & others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home & rebuild.#MAGA“ POTUS is degrading the imperial instruments, mainly the fakenews machinery. 27.12.2018: “CNN & others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!“ POTUS is already throwing of some bark of the host tree and forcing other parasites who also are more burden than benefit to stay on own feet. 24.12.2018: “Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!“ POTUS is preventing the imperial complex from spreading on the whole globe. 23.12.2018: ““It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he’s right…The generals still don’t get the mistake.” @RandPaul“ 23.12.2018: “Thanks @RandPaul “I am very proud of the President. This is exactly what he promised, and I think the people agree with him. We’ve been at war too long and in too many places…spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. He’s different…that’s why he got elected.”“ It is worth remembering who instructed the coup in Honduras. This person was Mr. Obama! The people are forced into misery and are now abused as troublemakers at the border of the United States. The US border has become a playground for the CIA business of human and drug trafficking. OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY! pic.twitter.com/ZGcYygMf3a — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2018 POTUS is attacking the most important and most powerful project lead by the CIA, which is explained in the next chapters and in more detail in the referred articles. 03.12.2018: “The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting “We Want Trump!” Love France.“ . 6. The Petrodollar Lobby It is worth looking at the role of the Saudi as a tool of imperial structure, because the Saudis secure the financial backbone of the empire by keeping the Petrodollar system alive. Without the other nations being forced to trade with the USA to earn Dollars to become able to buy petrol from the main oil markets, the global empire would not be able to finance its military and commercial structure. This power of Petrodollar is eroding and it seems inevitable that China, in cooperation with other countries will soon open a Yuan or multi-currency ( adding Rubel/Euro) based oil and gas market and the Arab petrol-dictators won’t have other choice but to join it. All needed preparations have been completed. Shanghai International Energy Exchange http://www.ine.cn/en/ China’s Oil Futures Give New York and London a Run for Their Money By Shen Hong Updated March 27, 2019 12:02 pm ET https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-oil-futures-give-new-york-and-london-a-run-for-their-money-11553679002 “Despite a surge in volumes, most trading in yuan-based contracts has been initiated by Chinese, rather than foreign players“ After dumping the imperial Dollar, USA may join this international currency basket for trading in international markets. However, now the Petrodollar depends on the “Water-Dollar“! Talking about water, most people may think about watergrabbing by nasty corporations like NESTLÈ, VEOLIA, SUEZ, CocaCola and similar. It is far above that. The control and trade is implemented by total control on the global water cycle. For understanding this particularly for Arabia and how the production of petrol and gas is dependent on water control, please read following articles about Somalia & Yemen. What is Geoengineering? https://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/what-is-geoengineering.html War on Yemeni Airspace as ClimateControl Water Hub for Arabia! https://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/climatecontrol-hub-yemen-importance-of.html Somalia As Water Bridge! Dead Birds Falling! End of Statehood! http://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/somalia-in-focus.html Peace for Yemen by Giving Airspace Water Corridor to Saudi Arabia! https://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/a-way-to-peace-for-yemen-giving-usa.html Why does Iran need atomic bomb? Not for war and deterrence, but for fracking! http://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/why-iran-needs-atom-bombs-not-for-war.html The topic can be told in a few sentences, but because of its complexity, details needs to be explained in many articles. Please take some time to delve through. Here I give a short explanation: USA based imperial complex depends on the Petrodollar. Petrol-Gas-Dictators depend on the water delivery by Climate Geoengineering. Climate-Geoengineering requires large scale airspace control. Resisting or insecure countries are destroyed by terror and carpet bombing. Stopping the water delivery to Arabia by means of Climate Geoengineering will bring down the huge desert farming industry and the petrol and gas industries in Arabia. That will result in accelerated weakening of the Petrodollar and the imperial complex. If You are not aware of these industries in Arabia, please check following evidence on the ground. Coordinates of WATER THEFT! http://geoarchitektur.blogspot.de/p/coordinates-of-water-theft.html Saudi water pipelines (thousands of kilometers) & dams (at least 230) & CO2 gasification! https://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/saudi-water-pipelines-and-dams.html Europe is poor & Arabia is rich on water! http://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/the-water-poor-will-be-named-water-rich.html As long as the Petrodollar delivers some benefit, the Petrodollar-Lobby which consists of the Petrol-Dictatorships and the Anglo-Saxon petrochemical & energy industries should be used to conduct a smooth transition to non-imperial state. . 7. CIA Climate Control Lobby Climate Control, is the opening of the box of Pandora! Don’t pretend not seeing it! The implosion of the Soviet Union also opened the way for the GLOBALISATION of commercial and military implementation of Climate Geoengineering! As explained above, water is delivered for the production of oil and gas and industrial scale desert farming, but all over the world, not only in the Arabian Desert. For the USA look at the shifted water balance between California & Texas. Why the water of California is now in NewMexico Texas & Arizona? California has no waterrights! http://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/where-water-goes-to.html This project officially began after 20 years of research in 1960 and is well documented in the CIA Memorandum on Climate Control. http://geoarchitektur.blogspot.de/p/cia-1960-memorandum-for-general-charles.html How the Geoengineering Scam began in 1965 by turning Geophysical Warfare into “Protection of Environment”, according the order of Lyndon B. Johnson! https://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/how-geoengineering-scam-began.html Ordering the CIA to roll out measures for the ability for Geophysical Warfare by Climate Control forced the CIA to hide, what is obvious by sight. As its longest term project it has become the most important and it keeps the CIA alive, despite of its endless failures and crimes. I don’t see any other reason to keep this state sponsored criminal network. Dear readers, please read the Memorandum and do Your own research. I deliver here some quotes from that historic document. “Small changes in circulation regimes[ extreme weather ] could bring about the moderation of severe temperature climates to yield additional areas suitable for human habitation.“ 📸|شاهد قيعان الرنق غرب مساحيم غرب الصعبيه غرب #مهدالذهب من عضو المجموعه نافع العزيزي مجموعه طقس مهدالذهب pic.twitter.com/akRVgsi9O6 — مجموعة طقس مهدالذهب (@wether_almhed) December 31, 2018 ربيع جنوب #مكة وادي ضيم يوم أمس ٢٧-٣-١٤٤٠ 🌿☘️ #صباح_الخميس pic.twitter.com/qFH4241Z1J — محمد الهذلي 🇸🇦 (@Mal_hothaly) December 6, 2018 “Such changes in circulation regimes can also affect the normal paths of destructive storms like hurricanes [waterspouts & storms], such that their destructive energies could be dissipated in regions far removed from major human activities.“ Happy new year from the clouds of 2018!

Giant hail stones did this https://t.co/PvUpYpsTwZ pic.twitter.com/ElgujabU08 — Alt-Rupert (@TheMurdochTimes) August 1, 2017 Based on that role, CIA is the leading organisation for a “global governance” of the water-cycle and carbon-cycle on our Earth. This is the essence of GLOBALISATION! The extreme change is the result of increasing total control on the weather system! We are in the midst of global war on water-cycle and climate-cycle, accompanied by “modern” hot wars by terror armies, tactical nuclear bombing, fake public uprisings and revolutions, targeted killings with or without drones, economic sanctions, fake accusations etc. Globalized Climate Control is not only driven by the CIA-US-Empire, but also India, China and Russia take their shares in that. The Petrodollar depends indirectly on that! IMHO, giving up Climate Control is the hardest part for POTUS, because the whole fracking industry, the energy production and a huge part of food production by industrial farming depend on water delivery by Climate Geoengineering. However, fracking has to be stopped or at least reduced dramatically as it is conducted by nuclear bombing the underground, followed by radioactive contamination of all biosphere. Nuclear fracking causes more damage than benefits by fuel supply. This reduction will become easy, when the USA doesn’t to spend all its resources for the Bankster Pervert Empire of Deception (BPED). . 8. Savings Reducing the military to the level of self defense, reducing the energy production to self sufficiency, eliminating the CIA and all its involvement in human trafficking, drug & weapon trade and investing all freed resources in own industrial production will save the United States of America and prevent interstate wars as a consequence of division. The conflicts of the world have to be solved by local people and powers. The empire never intended to solve them but always fed and created them to legitimize its interventions. If other powers runs into the same imperial trap, they will experience the same misery like the USA. . 9. Separation The petrochemical industry, energy industry, agricultural & food industry, military industry and the military of the USA and the banking industry have to stop their cooperation with the imperial framework. If they abuse US citizens and resources for imperial targets, they will have to be punished. US secret services have to serve only to save the USA but not conduct covert or operations of any kind in other parts of the world to impose imperial power. US naval forces will retreat to US national ports and waters. US air force will move only within the US airspace and protect it accordingly. Even if all that may not seem possible, the days as imperial main base and main vassal are ending. You, the people of USA conduct this separation in a controlled and smooth way or you will lose Your country in an uncontrolled implosion. The world is prepared enough to do it without the United States of America. Smaller state unions in North America may even be more preferable for the world powers. . 10. Cleaning the swamp ending the bloodshed Dear people of USA, you saved yourself and the world by not electing the Killary Monster into the White House. Thank you for that. Please be aware that Obamas, Clintons, Bidens, Pelosis and some others are now the head of the swamp. They fear to lose all the wealth they plundered from the World when being cleaned by President Donald Trump, therefore they do everything to prevent President Trump from finding solutions to all global problems by direct dialog with President Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China. The Clintons and Obamas have bathed in the blood of Haitians, Libyans, Syrians, Yemenites and Iraqis and are still plundering the oil reserves of all these countries. Global Shale Gas Initiative of Hitlery Killary Clinton and the water theft of Muammar Gaddafi! https://geoarchitektur.blogspot.com/p/global-shale-gas-initiative-of-hitlery.html The Bidens are plundering Ukraine. Together with Obama and Clinton, Joe Biden robbed the gold reserves, his son Hunter Biden is plundering the gas benefits of Ukraine. President Trump is now on this part of the swamp. Dear citizens of the USA, please help your president to dump the empire and save your America. Make business, don’t make imperial wars! Make America a great industry and business country again! With the retreat of US troops from Syria, POTUS took the right and inevitable decision to save the USA and the World. Please don’t let him alone. Protect and support him against the BPED henchmen in Washington D.C.! @connectingd3 Replying to @BreitbartNews “#POTUS promised to end the UN-Ending wars. The first time after 4 decades of expansion overseas, a President dared end it. Washington in Frenzy. Bipartisan cooperation for Kurds?

Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?

    "articleText": "…by Sputnik News, Moscow [ Editor’s Note: The battle for North Syria is entering this diplomatic stage with Vice President Pence on they way to visit Erdogan and the later heading to see Putin in Moscow after that. We anticipate the fighting toning down as everyone waits to see what comes of these high level talks will bring. The Turks have already accepted that where the Syrian Army has deployed that it will be the defacto policeman over the YPG Kurds and responsible for their conduct. Putin is emerging as the man in the center for cleaning up the current mess. This was a major concession where Turkey recognized Syrian authority over areas it controls. So the Kurds are boxed in now on their hopes of trying to secure an independent state under the military firepower of the US with its withdrawal. So what could motivate the Kurds to give up the ghost of independence? All I can see is their being tired of war and wanting to get back to normal living and working and having basic security. But the elephant in the living room is that mass media is still letting NATO and the US-Gulf coalition get away with its record of having sponsored and supported the use of proxy terrorists to advance their geopolitical goals. Any kind of “agreement” that does not squarely admit this and what changes will be made to stop it will just mean that we will be getting a pause in the terror violence until it can be cranked up again behind a new smokescreen. The dirty laundry of all those involved in supporting the Jihadi express must be laid bare during the process while we have world attention on it. Loading... As we have seen so many time in the past, “new” tragedies will emerge to distract public attention, like my suspecting that these new huge fires in Lebanon and Syria are the new mass terror weapon, yet I am the only one mentioning it so far. Why is no one asking why this is happening now all of a sudden? What’s up wid dat? And as a final footnote, I was surprise to see in some of the recent coverage on the US basing structure inside Syria, that then term “permanent” structures was used multiple times is discussing the difficulties of dismantling them. It begs the question why would the US be investing in “permanent” base construction if not to be used in defending what it had carved out of the Balkanization of the Syrian Repbublic? … Jim W.

We do not have such a goal – certainly be in Manbij. We have one concern, let Russia or [Syrian] regime be there, but terrorists should be cleared,” Erdogan told reporters.

The Kremlin hopes that the offensive will not affect the political process in Syria, Peskov stressed. The Kremlin spokesman noted that the timeline for termination of the offensive remained unclear. 12:19 Russian Military Police Conduct First Patrolling of Syria’s Manbij – Officer Russian military police officers have conducted their first patrolling of Syria’s northeastern city of Manbij, driving infantry mobility vehicles Tigr, Russian Military Police officer Safar Safarov said on Wednesday, just one day after the Russian Defence Ministry announced that the Syrian army had taken full control of the city and the Russian military was patrolling Manbij borders along the contact line between Syrian and Turkish forces. “Our patrol was driving the streets of this city for the first time ever. Military activities cease immediately at the sight of the Russian flag, as neither Turks nor Kurds want to affect us. So, fighting stops thanks to our efforts. Just one week ago we could not travel to Manbij openly and demonstrate our flag there, as US servicemen, present at two military bases, opposed us all the time, intercepting us on the road due to different understanding of areas of responsibility,” Safarov told reporters. The patrolling lasted for over three hours, Safarov added. “We will continue controlling our area of responsibility. Our main task is to ensure safety of the locals if any side starts a shelling. This is not our first task here, as we have been working here for over six months, and we have never experienced any problems with anyone,” Safarov added. The Russian Defence Ministry also said on Tuesday that the US military had left its bases in Dadat and Umm-Mial, located to the northwest of Manbij. 11:53 ‘Several Thousands’ PKK Members at Most are Present in Syria’s North – Syrian Intelligence Chief Only “several thousands” members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) are currently present in Syria’s north, where Turkey conducts its offensive, the head of the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, Husam Louka, said on Wednesday. “Kurds in Syria’s north are mainly represented by PKK members, their number does not exceed several thousands people,” Louka said on the sidelines of a security conference in Russia’s Sochi. 11:51 Syria to Be on Agenda During Erdogan’s Upcoming Visit to Russia – Lavrov The situation in Syria, namely preparations for the first session of the Syrian Constitutional Committee, will be on the agenda during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s upcoming visit to Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday. “The topics were outlined in yesterday’s statement, released after Putin’s phone conversation with President Erdogan. Of course, it will be mainly the situation in Syria, the task of ensuring the Syrian Arab Republic’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the conditions of hard-edged fight against the remains of terrorist groups, and, of course, the promotion of political process in the form of organizing the first inaugural session of the Constitutional Committee,” Lavrov told reporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin invited his Turkish counterpart to visit Russia on Tuesday, during their phone conversation, which focused on Ankara’s offensive in Syria’s north.

    "articleText": "On October 14, units of the Syrian Army started entering areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeastern Syria. The terms and conditions of the deal made by the SDF and Damascus are yet to be revealed, but government troops already deployed in Tabqah, Tabqah Airport, Tabqah Dam, Ayn Issa and Tal Tamir, and in the Manbij area. Syrian Army troops also moved towards the border town of Kobani. However, the situation there remains unclear. According to pro-Kurdish sources, US troops deployed there have attempted to prevent Syrian troops from entering the town by blocking the Qaraqozak bridge. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper officially stated that the US did not sign up to fight the Turks for the SDF. Nonetheless, this does not mean that Washington would help the SDF in implementation of its deal with Damascus. The US is not planning to fully withdraw its troops from the country. According to Esper, the US military presence will remain in Syria, especially in al-Tanf. Additionally, there is no timeline for the announced withdrawal of 1,000 troops. Turkey reacted to the Damascus-SDF deal by increasing its military efforts against the SDF around Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ain. Furthermore, Turkish-led forces launched an advance towards Ain Assa and Manbij, where they clashes with detachments of the Syrian Army. According to pro-Turkish sources, Turkish-backed militants captured a T-55 battle tank belonging to the Syrian Army near Manbij. Loading... The military situation in northeastern Syria may escalate even further if the Turkish Armed Forces and Turkish-backed militants continue their advance into the areas where the Syrian Army is already deployed. At the same time, Ankara’s attempts to capture Manbij will likely only strengthen the military and political cooperation between the SDF and Damascus. Loading...

    "articleText": "Syrian army troops have established full control over Manbij, a city in the northern province of Aleppo, and its nearby settlements, amid Turkey’s cross-border invasion in northeastern Syria and an abrupt US retreat of its forces from the city. Syria’s official news agency SANA reported on Tuesday that Syrian Arab Army units completed their deployment in Manbij and its surroundings, where they were welcomed by the locals. It added that residents of the northeastern city gathered in the city center, carrying Syrian flags and cheering for the army forces, which arrived to defend the city and its people from the Turkish military invasion. The Russian Ministry of Defense, as cited by the Tass news agency, also confirmed that Manbij and an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers around it were now under the full control of Syrian soldiers. “The Syrian government army has established full control over the city of Manbij and nearby inhabited communities,” it said. It added that the government troops had taken control of the Tabqa military airfield, two hydroelectric power plants, and a number of bridges across the Euphrates River. Loading... Manbij is located some 85 kilometers east of Aleppo, the capital city of the eponymous province. Back in August 2016, the city was liberated from the Daesh terrorist group, which had turned the city into one of its major outposts in the Arab country. On Sunday, Damascus said that it had deployed troops to northern Syria to counter the Turkish army. PressTV-Day 7 of Turkey Syria offensive: Latest updates Defying international calls to stop military action in Syria, Turkey keeps up the offensive, as Syrian forces take up positions in the country’s northern belt following a deal with Kurds. On October 9, Turkish military forces and the Turkish-backed militants launched a cross-border invasion of northeast Syria in a declared attempt to push Kurdish militants from the so-called People’s Protection Units (YPG) away from border areas. Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militant group, which has been involved in armed separatism in Turkey since 1984. Turkey plans to create a 32-kilometer “safe zone” in northeast Syria, clear it from the presence of Kurdish militants, and relocate one million Syrian refugees there. PressTV-Turkey will march on no matter what anyone says: Erdogan The Turkish president will not order an end to Syria operation until “ultimate victory.” The Syrian government has condemned the act of aggression. Earlier on Tuesday, the US military said that it had withdrawn all of its forces from Manbij. “Coalition forces are executing a deliberate withdrawal from northeast Syria. We are out of Manbij,” wrote Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a US military spokesman, on Twitter. A day earlier, Syrian Kurds had announced that they had reached an agreement with Damascus aimed at blunting the Turkish cross-border offensive into Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria.

As of this moment, Vice President Pence is heading for Turkey to meet with Erdogan, a day after Trump and congress imposed new sanctions on Turkey. Tomorrow, Erdogan goes to Moscow to meet with Putin. The US really entrenched itself across Syria, building airbases, pipelines, water treatment plants, ad hoc fortresses and, quite frankly, training camps for terrorists and bomb makers as well, using their logisitic/air capability to train and deploy jihadists from inside Syria to anywhere in the world, all done without a single member of the world press seeing anything. Loading... The American bases use Hesco barriers, closely akin to old Roman fortifications such those that secured Hadrian’s Wall, between Britain and the dangerous Picts. This bit of ‘window dressing’ is from the Daily Beast: “The retreat of U.S. forces in Syria away from the Turkish invasion is having a downstream effect benefitting the so-called Islamic State. The American surveillance aircraft that had been watching ISIS are now watching their own troops. Protecting the remaining U.S. forces in Syria is now the priority for the U.S. drones and manned aircraft overhead, according to a knowledgeable U.S. official who was not permitted to speak to reporters. It’s a mission of necessity now that the remaining hundreds of American service members in Syria have come under attack from the army of their NATO ally and the Syrian Kurds whom the U.S. betrayed are now welcoming in Bashar al-Assad’s Russian-sponsored forces. Their presence has propelled the U.S. in northeastern Syria toward an endgame, since the U.S. betrayal of the Kurds removed the local partner the U.S. needed to wage war against ISIS members—who are now breaking free of their prisons. The remaining hundreds of U.S. troops, for now, have pulled back to the southern at-Tanf base near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. American reconnaissance and surveillance over Syria is now about protecting bivouacking U.S. forces, the official said, rather than watching what happens to the newly-freed ISIS fighters. Among the reconnaissance assets remaining over Syria are Apache attack helicopters, a measurement of preparation for a withdrawal under fire. “ In Kobani, the US has a large airbase and huge tent complex that spreads for 3 square miles with hundreds of containers filled with intelligence and communications operational units. The rest of the US bases spread across the country, part of Advanced Operational Base West, up to 1000 men, mostly in and around Raqqa, where America is alleged to train jihadists who had “formerly” been members of ISIS. And from RT: “US fighter jets and gunship helicopters were sent to scare off Turkish-backed militants in northern Syria after they came “very close” to US troops at Ain Issa, the Pentagon said. Washington has also sent a complaint to Ankara. F-15 fighters and AH-64 Apache gunships were used in the “show of force” on Tuesday, an unnamed US official told reporters, after the militants “violated a standing agreement” not to threaten US troops. A formal complaint was lodged with the Turkish military through diplomatic channels, the official added.” Though US troops have been withdrawing from Syria for the past week, some Special Forces operators were apparently still in the area of Ain Issa, located on the strategic M-4 highway about halfway between the Syrian-Turkish border and the former Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) “capital” of Raqqa. Sitting on Syria’s oil fields, the US has another thousand troops, they say fewer but sources on the ground disagree, intended to shut down the border with Iraq at Bukamal. That effort failed and the border is now open. The NYT says American troops will return to Iraq, where they aren’t wanted or back to the American occupation zone north of Jordan, traveling by C17. America will be leaving 3000 vehicles behind with the Kurds which will end up in Syrian, Russian or Turkish hands, ides of the fall of Saigon 1975. Loading...

Read it at The New York Times (exceprt below) CEYLANPINAR, Turkey — Russia said on Tuesday that its military units were patrolling territory in northern Syria between Syrian and Turkish forces after the American withdrawal from the area, underscoring the sudden loss of United States influence in the area and illustrating how the power balance in the region has shifted rapidly in the past week. The announcement that Russian forces were now patrolling an area where the United States had until Monday maintained two military bases appeared to signal that Moscow was moving to fill a security void left by the withdrawal of both the American military and its partners in an international counterterrorism mission. Videos circulating on social media appeared to show a Russian-speaking man filming himself walking around a recently evacuated United States military base in northern Syria.

    "articleText": "By Samson Simon Sharif, Brigadier General (ret) for Veterans Today Introduction Unlike major religions, Hindu religion cannot be defined in a single sense. It has evolved around regions, tribes and castes in diverse forms of worship from the Southern tip of India to Hindukush, Indonesia and even the pacific islands. Hindu scholars find Hindu roots in all forms of ancient religions. Even today it continues to absorb and evolve. A case in point is the ‘Hussaini Hindus of Sindh Pakistan’; who follow some Islamic traditions. According to Prof Bani Prasad Sil: – “Hindu political thought has a spirit, a milieu, an atmosphere of its own as different from their western counter parts as Hindu personality, temperament and outlook are different from what one finds in Western Europe. Hindu thought does not fall under any of the accepted categories of western speculation. It stands by itself”. Unless we understand the many streams of Hinduism, it will be difficult to read Indian especially RSS intentions for futures. PART I OUTLINE OF SOUTH ASIAN HISTORY Pre-vedic Religion The earliest prehistoric religion in India that may have left traces in Hinduism dates to a period of 30,000 BC or older. Hindu Vedes, Simitris and written texts suggest this era to be glorious and highly advanced. To understand the Saffron wave, comprehension of the Pre-vedic Religion and history is important. Palaeolithic (2,500,000–250,000 BC) Neolithic (10,800–3300 BC) Beginning of Harappan Age Chalcolithic (3500–1500 BC) Bronze Age (3300–1300 BC) Loading... Vedic Period Though scholars disagree on timelines, the composition of the Vedic literature began in the 2000 BC. The oldest of these Vedic texts is the Rigveda, composed between 1500-1200 BC. Initially, the Brahmanical tradition had questioned the meaning and efficacy of Vedic rituals, then internalised and variously reinterpreted the Vedic rituals as ethical concepts. Iron Age (1500–200 BC) and Second Urbanisation (500–200 BC). Increasing urbanisation of India between 800 and 400 BCE, contributed to the rise of new ideas which challenged the orthodox Brahmanism. In Sramana culture which was Indo-European, Kashtriyas were placed higher than Brahmins. Gangetic plains, which gave rise to Jainism and Buddhism, incorporated a culture which was different form the Brahmanical orthodoxy. Classical Hinduism Middle Kingdoms (230 BC – AD 1206) Pre-classical Hinduism ( 200 BC-300 BC). From about 500 BC through about 300 CE, the Vedic-Brahmanic synthesis continued. Classical Hindu and Sramanic (particularly Buddhist) ideas spread within Indian subcontinent, as well outside India such as in Central Asia, and the parts of Southeast Asia (coasts of Indonesia and peninsular Thailand). Brahmans incorporated Buddhist influences. The major Sanskrit epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, were compiled. The Bhagavad Gita was composed in this period. The foundational texts of several schools of Hindu philosophy were formally written. Arthashastra deals with the political mind and Mahabharata with the militant mind. “Golden Age” (Gupta Empire, Ashoka and Ghandara) ( 320–650 BC). During the Gupta period, the first stone and cave Hindu temples dedicated to Hindu deities were built, some of which have survived into the modern era. Numerous monasteries and universities were also built during the Gupta dynasty era, which supported Vedic and non-Vedic studies. It was a big Hindu-Buddhist Kingdom spreading from Hindukush to Pataliputra but excluding South India. During Ashoka’s reign Hinduism and Buddhism spread to all India except Southern tip and Sri Lanka. Taxila was capital. Note that these with Hindu-Buddist Empires Late-Classical Hinduism – Puranic Hinduism (650–1100 CE). Major Hinduism scholars of this period notably included Bhartrhari, Vasugupta and Abhinavagupta of Kashmir Shaivism. Islamic Hindu Period Late Medieval Period (1206 AD–1526 AD). The Islamic rule period witnessed Hindu-Muslim cooperation, confrontation and violence. First Mosque at Banbore (Karachi) was constructed within 100 AH. THE HUSSAINI Brahmins is a community that has an intertwined link with Hinduism and Islam. It is said that their ancestor, Rahab Sidh Dutt had sacrificed his seven sons for Imam Hussain at Karbala in 61 AH. The community came to be known as Hussaini Brahmins. They are now spread across Sindh in Pakistan, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and other parts of India, Pakistan and Arabia. They gave Muslims safety in Sindh after the tragedy of Karbala. This dynasty ruled in Afghanistan for 120 years, from 830 AD to 950 AD. They are Pakistan’s assets. I will not go into details of Muslim rule over India as it is already well known. Modern Period Early modern period (1526 AD–1858 AD). The British Raj, started a Hindu Renaissance in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west. Western researchers created the false notion of “Hinduism” as a unified body of religious praxis and the popular picture of ‘mystical India’. Yoga, Ayurvedic health and Tantric sexuality were particularly attractive. Hindutva and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (1920 to date). In the 20th century, Hinduism also gained prominence as a political force and a source for Hindu national identity in India. Both evolved and grew together. PART II HINDUTVA AND THE HINDU MILITANT MIND Note the size of India on 15 August 1947 “Just as the Arthashastra has for many years been scanned for what it has to say about the development of Indian state-craft, the Mahabarata is now being explored for what it has to say about the essence of Indian military mind” G.N. Pant Hindutva Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was a pragmatic practitioner of Hindu Philosophy. As response to the Pan Islamism and Muslim League, Savarkar joined the Hindu Mahasabha and popularized the term Hindutva (Hinduness), previously coined by Chandranath Basu, to create a collective “Hindu” identity as an essence of Bharat. The three essentials of Hindutva in Savarkar’s definition were the common nation (rashtra), common race (jati), and common culture or civilisation (sanskriti). Savarkar used the words “Hindu” and “Sindhu” interchangeably. These laid foundation of Hindutva, as geographic, cultural and ethnic concepts. His elaboration of Hindutva included all Indian religions, i.e. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Savarkar believed that the Indian subcontinent, which included the area south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush, or “Akhand Bharat” is the homeland of the Hindus. He considered as Hindus those who consider India to be their motherland, fatherland and holy land, hence describing it purely in cultural terms. Hindutva is not a static and monolithic concept. Like the Hindu religion it keeps evolving and adapting to times. According to Dr. Arvind Sharma, its context, text and subtext changed over the past century. To understand Hindutva, it is important to understand the prevailing environments that made its morphing reactionary. Colonialism added a sense of “ethnicity” to the original “Hinduness” meaning of Hindutva. Its early formulation incorporated the racism and nationalism concepts prevalent in Europe during the first half of the 20th-century, and was in part rationalised as a result of “shared blood and race”. In the post-independence period, the concept suffered from ambiguity and its understanding aligned on “two different axes” – one of religion versus culture, another of nation versus state. In general, the Hindutva thought among many Indians has tried to align itself with the culture and nation axes. Savarkar praised the growth of Italy and Germany during the Fascist and Nazi rule; he believed that Nazism and Fascism were “the most congenial tonics, their health demanded.” He often compared Germany’s German majority and Jewish minority as analogous to India’s Hindu majority and Muslim minority. In 1938, he wrote, “if we Hindus in India grow stronger in time, these Moslem friends of the League type will have to play the part of German Jews”. The movement grew with the formulation and development of the Hindutva ideology and the establishment of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925; and the entry, and later success, of RSS offshoots Jana Sangha and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in electoral politics. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) RSS was founded in 1925 by Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar at Nagpur. As a follower of Savarkar, he realised that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. The RSS is the progenitor and leader of a large body of organisations called the Sangh Parivar which have presence in all facets of the Indian society. RSS is the world’s largest voluntary organisation. Sang Parivar comprises: – Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council, VHP). It supports all migrant Hindu politicians world over and works through an NGO called SEWA. Bharatiya Janata Party Bajrang Dal the moral police like Hitler’s Youth. Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, the overseas branch of the RSS Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a worker’s union Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student’s union Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers’ organisation Hindu Jagaran Sammukhya, an activist group against conversion. Abhinav Bharat Virat Hindu Sammelan (VHS) Shiv Sena Bharatiya Janata Party After his release from the colonial prison, Savarkar joined and became the president of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha in 1937. In 1944 Syama Prasad Mukherjee, served as its president and joined the Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet after independence. Later, he resigned from the party and founded a new political party in collaboration with the RSS. He understood Hinduism as a nationality rather than a community but, realising that this is not the common understanding of the term Hindu, he chose Bharatiya instead of Hindu to name the new party, which came to be called the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1951. In 1980 Jana Sangh converted to BJP. After the 1998 general election, the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed a government that lasted for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office. In the 2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Damodar Das Modi (an RSS member) led it to victory in the 2014 general election. In 2018, BJP won a landslide victory. The Changing Sub Text of BJP For a rising party like BJP, the 2004 defeat was unexpected. Meanwhile the popularity of Chief Minister Modi in Gujarat was growing. RSS and the BJP had been party to the Gujarat violence that erupted after the Godhra train burning. Christian groups accused the RSS and its close affiliates of participation in the 2008 religious violence in Odisha. True to traditions of Hinduism and Hindutva, The Sang Parivars recruit for 2014 election was Modi. He is a sworn RSS member and believes in ethnic, racial and religious cleansing. His RSS and other affiliates are noted for their violence against Muslims, Christians and Dalits. BJP is no more a party that Vajpayee headed. The new philosophy of BJP finds roots in the India of antiquity. “We beheld in the sky what appeared to us to be a mass of scarlet cloud resembling the fierce flames of a blazing fire. From that mass many blazing missiles flashed, and tremendous roars, like the noise of a thousand drums beaten at once. And from it fell many weapons winged with gold and thousands of thunderbolts, with loud explosions, and many hundreds of fiery wheel.” Vaimānika Śāstra The Vedic gods hailing fire and inter-steller flights Modi believes in Narendra Damodardas Modi the Prime Minster believes that such an India kingdom existed in antiquity and that he is the reincarnation of Arjuna in Baghavad Gita, flying a massive Vimana with thousands of airborne chariots carrying out inter stellar journeys. He believes that these flying objects rained hell with nuclear devices Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. He is convinced that he is the chosen one by gods to lead the charge. The land he must hail with fire is Pakistan to re-carve an Akhand Bharat. He and his Parivar are determined to follow Rigveda, Mahabharata, Baghavad Gita and Ramayana. Over the years, the representation of Jat and other Hindus in the defence services has increased leading to rebirth of the Kashtriya tradition and the emergence of a militant Hindu core. Already their vigilantes dominate streets and the establishment. They nuclearized India; call for unification of Kashmir and ultimate annexation of Pakistan. The Saffron Wave The incidents with strong religious tones are as follows. 1992 Babri Masjid 1999 burning to death of Graham Staines a Christian missionary, and his two sons in January 1999 and many other crimes against Christians. 2002 Gujarat riots 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings 2007 Ajmer Dargah attack 2008 Malegaon blasts 2007 Mecca Masjid bombing Cow vigilante violence in India. There have been a hundred and sixty-eight attacks by Hindu extremists, in the name of protecting cows, against Muslims and other religious minorities. The attacks left forty-six people dead. Most of these attacks were carried out by Bajrang Dal, the ultramilitant arm of RSS.

    "articleText": "By Firas Samuri for Veterans Today On October 7, 2019, the U.S. President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from northeast Syria, where the contingent alongside Kurdish militias controlled the vast territories. Trump clarified that the decision is connected with the intention of Turkey to attack the Kurdish units, posing a threat to Ankara. It’s incredible that the Turkish military operation against Kurds – indeed the territorial integrity of Syria has resulted in the escape of the U.S., Great Britain, and France. These states essentially are key destabilizing components of the Syrian crisis. Could this factor favourably influence the situation in the country? For instance, after the end of the Iraqi war in 2011 when the bulk of the American troops left the country, the positive developments took place in the lives of all Iraqis. According to World Economics organization, after the end of the conflict, Iraq’s GDP grew by 14% in 2012, while during the U.S. hostilities the average GDP growth was about 5,8%. Syria’s GDP growth should also be predicted. Not right away the withdrawal of U.S., French, British, and other forces, but a little bit later after the end of the Turkish operation that is not a phenomenon. The Turkish-Kurdish conflict has been going on since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire when Kurds started to promote the ideas of self-identity and independence. Apart from numerous human losses, the Turks accomplished nothing. It is unlikely that Ankara would achieve much in Peace Spring operation. The Kurds realize the gravity of the situation and choose to form an alliance with the Syrian government that has undermined the ongoing Turkish offensive. Under these circumstances, Erdogan could only hope for the creation of a narrow buffer zone on the Syrian-Turkish border. The withdrawal of the Turkish forces from the region is just a matter of time. However, we can safely say that the Turkish expansion unwittingly accelerated the peace settlement of the Syrian crisis, as the vital destabilizing forces left the country. Besides, the transfer of the oil-rich north-eastern regions under the control of Bashar Assad will also contribute to the early resolution of the conflict. It remains a matter of conjecture what the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia agreed on during the high-level talks. Let’s hope that not only the Syrians, but also key Gulf states are tired of instability and tension in the region, and it’s a high time to strive for a political solution to the Syrian problem.

Syria’s official SANA news agency cited local sources as saying that several people have arrived at the Hasaka hospital with “severe burns,” which were apparently caused by “unknown chemical substances.” Press TV cannot independently verify the reports. Ras al-Ayn has been the scene of battles between Kurdish militants and the Turkish military. There have been reports of Turkish strikes and shelling in the northern city over the past days. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish forces and allied militants had “taken about half of the town” by Thursday morning. Turkey launched the offensive, called Operation Peace Spring, on October 9 with the aim of purging the northern Syrian regions near its border of Kurdish militants, whom it views as terrorists linked to local autonomy-seeking militants of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The incursion came after the US abruptly pulled its forces out of the region, clearing the path for Turkey to go ahead with a planned military action against Washington’s longtime Kurdish allies.

    "articleText": "The Tukish.backed jIhadist Ahrar al-Sharqiya slaughtered with bestial ferocity the young Kurdish woman that worked for the pacification of Royava in Syria by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio for VT Italy Hevrin Haly Khalaf (Xelef in Kurdish) was slaughtered with bestial ferocity by his executioners. The outcome of the autopsy conducted by Dr. Tayceer Al Makdesi, a specialist in Forensic Investigative Medicine, on the body of the 35-year-old human rights activist killed last Saturday in a real ambush on the M4 motorway, which connects Aleppo, Manbji, Hasaka and Qamishli, leaves no doubt: «Cause of death: severe cerebral hoemorrhage following gunshot wounds to the head». In particular, her head was riddled with many gunshots by several killers of the jihadist faction Ahrar al-Sharqiya, the group close to Al Qaeda funded and armed by Turkey. This is confirmed by the numerous injuries detected during the autopsy conducted by the doctor at the Al Malikyah hospital where the body had been taken before the great funerals held Monday in Derek, in her village near the border with Iraq and not far from Qamishli . Secretary General of the Future Syria Party, Hevrin Khalaf, was captured then executed by Turkish-backed forces The appraisal therefore confirms that the woman died from a barrage of bullets, some shot from close range as confirmed by the abrasions near the wounds, others from a greater distance, to the head but also to the back, and denies that it was the stoning, as claimed by the social media and brutally taken up by Italian national newspapers, to cause death. Not only: in the autopsy report there is no reference to signs of the alleged sexual violence that the fake-news professionals shouted causing famous italian newspapers to revive the suspect without the slightest response. The multiple bruises, the fractures and the areas of depression on the face confirm that it was also affected, may be with some stones or with the butt of the rifle, but this would have happened as a sign of contempt perhaps when she had already died for the numerous blows of ammunition with caliber compatible with semi-automatic smooth bore rifles. read more THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN ASSAD’S ARMY, RUSSIAN AND KURDISH SDF Loading... «I saw an entrance wound of many gunshots 12×1,5 cm and the presence of coal around the wound, vertically on right upper temporale area of the head until the right angel of the mouth, with fractures in the temporal and malar bones and mandibular, and this area is depressed, and the angel of the mouth was wounded and left eye depressed and there is a traumatic bruise 5 cm diameter on the right superior occipital area an there is depressed fractur under it cm diameter – Dr Tayceer Al Makdesi has written in the report released by Kurdish Red Crescent and spread by Rojava Information Center – And there is an entrance wound of many gunshots 4 cm diameter on the superior occipital area of the head and the exit of brain matter from it». The autopsy about Hevrin Khalaf death released by Turkish Red Crescent In the lower occipital area of the head there are the exit wounds of the shots and the occipital bone is fractured. Furthermore « a circular gunshots wound 7 mm diameter on the back on the right side of the vertebral column at the level of the third vertebra without shot products around it, and there are on the right of the last wounded three similar entrance wounds far 5 cm from it». «From the above we conclude that the woman was beaten with a solid body on the head, which led to the occurence of low fracture» you can read on page 2 of the report. There is also a traumatic wound on the right leg and both lower limbs report some bone fractures. Hevrin was dragged by the hair until she tore off part of it along with the scalp. But it was the shots that were fatal. «She was hit by gunshot of war weapon in the head from the right front of the body at close range 40-75 cm After falling to the ground she was hit by four shots from the back and exited the abdomen at not close range. Head injury caused damage to the brain and severe bleeding resulted in death». The jihadist group Tukish-backed Ahrar-al-Sharqiya On the morning of Saturday 12 October, the woman was returning from Hasaka where she had attended a meeting with other activists of her new party, of which she was also the general secretary, the “Future Syrian Party”, a group close to Curdi who proposed dialogue with Christians and Arabs of Sunni and Shiite confession for the pacification of Rojava and the protection of women’s rights.

    "articleText": "Units of Syrian government forces have entered the strategic northern city of Raqqah and begun setting up some observation posts there, amid a ground offensive by the Turkish military and allied militants against Kurdish forces in the war-ravaged Arab country. Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Mayadeen television news network reported on Wednesday that Syrian army forces have been deployed in villages on the border with Turkish-backed Takfiri militants. An unnamed field source also told Russia’s Sputnik news agency that Syrian government forces entered the city of Raqqah, the former de facto capital of Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in Syria, for the first time in five years and installed some checkpoints there. The development came after militants from the Kurdish-dominated and so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) cut a deal with the Damascus government for army troops to deploy at the border and confront a Turkish military campaign against the Kurds. Syrian government forces deploy on the outskirts of Tal Tamr town in Syria’s northeastern province of al-Hasakah on October 16, 2019. (Photo by SANA) On Monday, Syrian government forces arrived in the towns of Tabqa, on the outskirts of Raqqah, and Ayn Isa, which served as the headquarters of the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northeast Syria and is located 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the Turkish border. Loading... The shift by Kurdish forces under Turkish fire came after President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision in recent days to withdraw US troops from northeastern Syria, leaving Kurdish forces that had allied with the US-led military coalition purportedly fighting the Daesh terror group vulnerable to Turkish offensive. Later in the day, Syria’s official news agency SANA reported that government forces had entered a number of villages on the outskirts of Tell Tamr town in the northeastern province of al-Hasakah. Syrian government forces deploy on the outskirts of Tal Tamr town in Syria’s northeastern province of al-Hasakah on October 16, 2019. (Photo by SANA) Syria troops fight Turkish forces alongside Kurds: SOHR Meanwhile, the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Syrian army forces have deployed alongside Kurdish forces on the front line in northern Syria. The Britain-based monitor reported on Wednesday that government troops and Kurdish militants were “fighting together” against Turkish-sponsored militants northeast of Ayn Issa. A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on October 15, 2019 shows Syrian army troops posing with a national flag after reportedly completing their deployment in the northern Syrian city of Manbij. The Observatory added that “violent clashes” are underway near the M4 highway, which runs from the western coastal city of Latakia to Saraqib city in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib. “We should end the fighting immediately” Separately, the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said on Wednesday that he had repeated the appeal for fighting to end “immediately” in northeastern Syria. “We obviously concentrated on the situation in the northeast and I repeated the Secretary General’s (António Guterres’) strong appeal that we should end the fighting immediately, that there needs to be a cessation of hostilities, and that we are extremely alarmed by the humanitarian consequences of the crisis and that, we today, have seen already too many people killed and of course more than 160,000 people being displaced,” Pedersen told reporters following talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem in Damascus. The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen (R) meets with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem in Damascus, Syria, on October 16, 2019. (Photo via Facebook) He added, “There is only a political solution also to the crisis in the northeast and we are appealing to all parties to participate in this. We also discussed the launching of the constitutional committee and we had a rather detailed discussion on how we are going to move forward with the launch of the committee by the end of this month.” “I will continue to have discussions with the co-chairs of the government list and the co-chair of the opposition. I must say that so far, the discussions I had here in Damascus and with the opposition in Riyadh have been very good when it comes to launching the constitutional committee. Of course, this hopefully can then be a door opener, as I have said many times, to a broader political process,” the senior UN official pointed out. PressTV-Erdogan: No talks with Syria Kurds until safe zone established President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey’s military operation in Syria’s north will only end when the Kurds leave the region and a “safe zone” is established there. On October 9, Turkish military forces and Ankara-backed militants launched a long-threatened cross-border invasion of northeast Syria in a declared attempt to push Kurdish militants from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) away from border areas. Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984. The YPG constitutes the backbone of the SDF. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "description": "\"Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand[s], but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.”",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis “When ideology is your guide,” Daniel J. Flynn writes in Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas, “You are bound to get lost. Ideology deludes, inspires dishonesty, and breeds fanaticism. Facts, experience, and logic are much better at leading you to truth. Truth, however, is not everyone’s intended destination.”[1] If you think that Flynn isn’t onto something here, then start paying very close attention to some of the craziest or completely preposterous statements that politicians and journalists of various stripes continue to make in the political and intellectual landscape. Sometimes it would get so bad that I would end up asking myself: “These people did go to college, where they are supposed to get an education. Yet why do they continue to assert deliberately stupid statements? They certainly know that those same statements would not even be accepted even in a high school class that deals with logic and some common sense. Why do they want to annoy virtually every thinking person? Where do they get these people?” People who take logic and reason seriously always try to follow an argument to its logical conclusion and see where it really leads. This is why the rules of logic do not sit well with a pernicious ideology. In other words, an argument is either valid or invalid, coherent or incoherent. It cannot be both. If one is present, then the other one has to be absent. But since an ad hominem attack or straw man or red herring is cheap, all you have to do these days to demonize a person you don’t like is come up with stupid argument. You don’t have to flesh out a serious argument. What am I saying here? Both the New York Times and CNN have recently and deliberately smeared Hawaii congresswoman and 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. They argument they presented? Babbard has said: “Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia — completely despicable.” It was CNN analyst Bakari Sellers who said that Gabbard was a “puppet for the Russian government.”[2] Why is she a Russian puppet? Well, she is just a Russian puppet. That’s all, folks! If you even dare say that the United States should not support the war in Syria, if you say that Russia is not really America’s enemy, then you are ipso facto a Russian puppet. This is the kind of serious sophistication that we are dealing with here! But Gabbard has the intellectual gun and mental power to shut those puppets and political whores down. She said: “Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand[s], but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.”[3] Loading... Two cheers for that, sister. [1] Daniel J. Flynn, Intellectual Morons: How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas (New York: Crown Forum, 2004), 1.

    "articleText": "The soldiers of Damascus welcomed to An Issa and Tabqa welcomed with tripudios by the people of Rojava after the alliance with the Kurdish SDF militias Already 41 Kurdish, Christians and Arabs civilians killed from the criminal xenophobia of the Islamic dictator by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio for VT Italy If Vladimir Putin really had foreseen everything, he is truly a genius in the art of war. He is an exceptional military strategist before being a great statesman. Knowing well the determination of Recep Tayyib Erdogan to make war on the Kurds of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), used by the US to fight the Islamic State and then abandoned with cowardly betrayal and futile excuses by the American president Donald Trump, he did not put himself sideways . The president of the Federation of Republics of Russia, Vladimir Putin The Russian president has let the Islamic dictator of Turkey, supported by the Sunni-Salafist Muslim Brotherhood of radical confession, carry out his bloody military actions (the last budget is 41 dead and 165 only seriously injured among civilians, without considering those that Turkey defines “neutralized terrorists”). Then he intervened diplomatically. The agreement facilitated by Russia between the government of the Arab Republic of Syria and the SDF militia led by the YPG, a true soul of the Autonomous Administration of Rojava, was unthinkable until a few months ago when the Kurds felt strongly protected by Washington and therefore from the greatest military power in the world. The festive welcome of the people of Rojava to the Syrian Army on the outskirts of the city of Tabqa It became reality in just a few hours precisely as a result of Erdogan’s murderous madness. And now all the population of the nation battered by 8 years of civil war, the Kurds, the Christians, the Sunni and Shiite Arabs of the peripheral tribal councils welcome the Syrian Arab army with enthusiasm, joy and emotion. It happened yesterday in An Issa (near the prison camp from which 859 Foreing Fighers Isis fled after a Turkish bombardment), and al-Tabqa, near Raqqa, and in the villages surrounding Manbij: one of the cities where you are playing the first major clash between the Syrian army and the Turkish army: but the fate of this war in many ways in Putin’s hands (the military diary of the day here). Moscow has not tried to politically stop the Ankara operation called with sinister sarcasm “Peace Spring” knowing that it would have had little chance of success exactly as the European Union, which for years ignores the bestial violence perpetrated by pro-Turkish jihadists in the areas of border, become systematic and daily in Afrin with the operation Olive Branch launched in 2018, and now it clatters like an old bitch abused by her usual client … Loading... THE CRIMINAL XENOPHOBIA OF THE ISLAMIC DICTATOR Putin also knew that to dissuade from his plans Ankara would have had to compromise on the stragica province of Idlib, still occupied from the jihadists of Al Nusra armed from the Turks, a perennial threat for the near base of the Russian aerospace fleet of Khmeimim, fundamental to protect the base of the Russian Navy of Tartus thanks to which Moscow has a direct outlet on the Mediterranean. But the Kremlin statesman also knew that this would not be enough to quell the genocidal xenophobia of Erdogan against Kurdish atavistic enemies against whom continued social infamous persecutions in the total indifference of the goodists of Brussels who imposed the prohibition also the European journalists to use the “illegal” word to define migrants even when they are exponents of the Nigerian Mafia or ISIS. read more ERDOGAN ATTACKS ROJAVA FOR HELPING JIHADIST AND ISIS PRISONERS Suffice it to recall that PKK party leader Abdullah Ocalan is serving a life sentence in Turkish prisons as his organization has been called terrorist. His niece Dilek Öcalan is a candidate with the Democratic People’s Party (HDP) in the 2015 general election and was elected as a Member of the Turkish Parliament. In 2018, however, she was arrested and sentenced to two years and six months by the public government for speaking at a funeral. The accusation is of incitement to insurrection and terrorism. For a long time the socialist parliamentarians of the HDP (today 67 out of 600 members of the Ankara assembly) are fighting to obtain from Turkey the revision of the Constitution which banned the Kurdish language and ethnicity since the birth of the Republic in 1922. read more CIA SECRET FILE: THE REGIME-CHANGE PLANNED SINCE 1983 In a nutshell it was explained why Putin could not have stopped Ankara that for decades has sown hatred in Syria through an intense intelligence work by MIT (Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı) the secret servants of Ankara, in collaboration with the CIA regime-change scheme of the 1983 and with the Israeli friends of the Mossad who plot in the shadow of every turmoil in the Middle East, as evidenced in the latest reports of Gospa News. Letting Turkey act.

THE AMBULANCE BOMBED The martyrdom of the young Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf, human rights activist of the Future Syria Party shot by Islamic terrorists, and of the small Christian Sara of only 10 years, killed in Qashimli by the rockets of the Turkish Army, were two sacrifices in the midst of so many others that have shaken the soul of the nation even before that of Europe and the whole world. read more SARA, THE FIRST CRISTIAN CHILD KILLED BY SHELLS Now the victory of Assad’s soldiers against those of Erdogan is all in Putin’s hands. Turkey has means far more powerful than those of the Syrian army, weakened by years of war against the Islamic State. Just look at the images of the brigade that arrived in Taqba for now only with Toyota pik-ups armed with machine guns. While the troops of Ankara are advancing in the countryside of Hasaka and Kobane with tanks and armored vehicles. Alongside the Turks, however, there are only the poorly armed and ill-trained jihadists, only their ferocity against the weak. While alongside the military in Damascus there are the Syrian Democratic Forces, trained by the US and already victorious against the ISIS in Raqqa and Bagouz. THE WAR’S FATE DEPENDS BY RUSSIAN AIRCRAFTS Ankara can however also count on a powerful and modern aviation, thanks to the squadron of F-16 that in a land clash can represent a huge advantage. Precisely for this reason, as is clearly shown by a report by the Rojava Information Center (see military diary), SDF officials are demanding that the US completely leave air control in the hands of Russia. Syrian President Bashar Al Assad on a war plane of the Russian aerospace fleet at the Khmeimim military base in Syria – VIDEO That’s why the outcome of this war is all in the hands of Putin: it depends on whether or not he decides to use his powerful combat aircraft positioned on the Syrian base at Khmeimim where there are 30 fighters of the various Su-35S models, Su- 34, Su-24 and Mi-35 and Mi-8AMTSh helicopters. To this fleet of the Aerospace Army must be added the Sukhoi 57E Stealth, or invisible to radars, the latest generation of fighter-bombers that made their first demonstrative operational action in February 2018 at the military airport near Latakia. The latest-generation Russian Sukhoi-57E fighter-bomber aircraft Against these futuristic jets, only the F-35s of Lockeed Martin could compete, of which Erdogan has suspended the purchase following tensions with Trump who wanted to prevent Ankara from buying Russian-made anti-aircraft S-400 defense systems. In light of today’s events it almost seems like there was an underground Kremlin strategy also in the management of this military business … THE ERDOGAN’S BLACKMAIL TO EUROPE The Islamic extremist dictator continues to repeat that he will go all the way to conquer his 32 km-deep security strip in Rojava and 460 km long for a 13,800 sq km larger throne area that Russia is not a problem. In the next few hours we will understand if his is a wish, a warning or a certainty. And the 130 Italian soldiers who are dangerously positioned on the Syrian North-East front will understand it for the NATO Active Fence mission in defense of Turkish airspace! The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, shows the map with the “safe-zone” to be conquered in Syria demarcated with the red line From Washington, President Trump threatens heavy sanctions against Turkey for the massacre that was started thanks to the withdrawal of the US Marines from the northern Syrian borders and from Kobane (yesterday) but not from the oil-rich areas of the Euphrates valley. Therefore it is not known if, how and when the financial blocks of the USA will arrive. At the moment there is only one certainty: neither the European Union, in political turmoil in any order, on an embargo on the sale of arms to Turkey that is useless in the immediate, nor can NATO surrender to Erdogan’s threat to release 3 million of Syrian refugees refugees in his country if he is not allowed to complete the Peace Spring operation. No institution worthy of the name can indeed accept that Ankara uses the management of migrants as a bargaining chip in order to carry out a Kurdish genocide. If they did so, they would allow the new Stalin to legitimize its tyrannical policy throughout the Old Continent, which is already increasingly poor in values. They would allow a fundamentalist Islamic dictator to act as a Nazi-communist by depriving of all meaning the whole history of the Italian and European Resistance against the SS of the Third Reich.

He also met Chinese entrepreneurs and businessmen. Meetings were marked by traditional warmth, mutual understanding and strategic trust. Prime Minister Imran also attended the Closing Ceremony of the Beijing Horticulture Expo 2019 as a chief guest. He congratulated the Chinese leadership and people on the 70th Anniversary of founding of the People’s Republic of China. He stated that the steady march of the Chinese nation under its visionary leadership towards national rejuvenation was becoming a reality. Both sides found common grounds on a wide range of bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual interest. Recalling the joint statement of November 4, 2018, the two sides reaffirmed their firm resolve to further strengthening Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership aimed at building a community of shared future in the new era. Addressing the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, which contributed to peace, stability and development in the region, the two sides reaffirmed their support on issues concerning each other’s core interests. Chinese leaders reiterated solidarity with Pakistan in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty, independence and security. However, presence of Pakistan’s politico-military leaders and their meetings with their Chinese counterparts have conveyed a string message to the region and international community that both countries will stand shoulder to shoulder, irrespective of time. China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has got a big boost and its next phase is being launched under supervision of a unified authority. Beijing’s desire to make it as a model project of China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) or China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is heartening. Loading... Nevertheless, the joint press release said that Pakistan “supports One Chnia Policy” and reiterated that “affairs of Hong Kong are China’s internal matter and all countries should uphold international law and basic norms of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries”. The Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the situation in the Indian Held Kashmir. The Chinese side responded that it was “paying close attention” to the current situation in the occupied Kashmir” and acknowledged that “the issue is a dispute left from history, and should be peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter…relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. The two sides underlined that “a peaceful, stable and prosperous South Asia is in the common interest of all parties”. Both sides maintained in the joint statement that the second phase of the CPEC will promote industrial and socio-economic development in Pakistan. The Pakistani delegation highlighted that the Gwadar Port has been granted various facilities enabling it to become a trade and logistical hub for the region. The two sides expressed determination to speedily “execute CPEC so that its growth potential can be fully realised making it a high-quality demonstration project for the Belt and Road Initiative”. The two sides held in-depth exchange of views on deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, finance, defence and security, education, agriculture, social sector, people-to-people contacts and cultural linkages. They agreed that early implementation of the second phase of the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement would contribute to an increase in bilateral trade. In this regard, during the visit of P.M. Imran and Chinese Premier Li witnessed the signing of various agreements and Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs). Reaffirming that there is no military solution in Afghanistan, the two sides agreed that peace and stability in Afghanistan is vital for regional security and expressed satisfaction at the outcomes of the third China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue held in Islamabad on September 7, 2019. The Chinese leadership appreciated Islamabad’s efforts for peace in the region and especially her central role in promoting peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan. In this respect, the joint press release said that both sides maintained “an inclusive, and Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process would be key to bring peace and stability in the country.” China and Pakistan also reiterated their commitment to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with China calling on the international community to “objectively recognise Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and security through its success in [the] fight against terrorism”. Prime Minister Imran thanked the leadership and people of China for their hospitality, and invited the Chinese leadership to visit Pakistan at a mutually convenient time. Some US-led foreign entities had been creating misunderstanding about the CPEC project. Hence, Islamabad has removed all the misgivings raised about CPEC by vested interests in and outside Pakistan. Notably, India was openly opposing the CPEC; the US also joined New Delhi. In this context, on October 3, 2017, the then US Defence Secretary James Mattis told the Lawmakers, “The United States has reiterated its support for India’s opposition to China’s One Belt, One Road initiative…the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) a part of which traverses Pakistan-Kashmir.” Pakistan strongly rejected the statement from the American defence chief that the multibillion-dollar road and rail network CPEC will pass through a disputed territory of Kashmir, urging the international community to focus on blatant human rights violations and ‘heinous crimes’ committed by Indian occupation forces in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), and reminded America that Washington had also participated in an OBOR summit. Earlier, a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry also dismissed Mattis’ statement, saying that the OBOR plan was backed by the United Nations and that CPEC was an economic cooperation initiative. Russia also supports the OBOR and CPEC. Nonetheless, Pakistan’s sources stated that CPEC’s next major phase of expansion and consolidation will be launched in coming weeks, bringing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and making Pakistan a magnet for foreign investment. While, in a press briefing regarding the trip of Premier Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa to China in wake of the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, Director General of Pakistan Army’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Maj-Gen. Asif Ghafoor stated on October 11, this year: “President Xi Jinping has assured that his country will not remain silent if Pakistan needs it…Prime Minister Imran Khan asked the Chinese President to inform Modi that curfew should be removed immediately from occupied Kashmir…the visit of Pakistani leadership was important in the current scenario, while China has assured Pakistan its cooperation in Financial Action Task Force…civil and military leadership in Pakistan is working together.” Maj-Gen. Asif Ghafor elaborated that the visit to China was based on a 3-point agenda; “No.1 occupied Kashmir, No. 2, CPEC and No.3 Pak-China defense cooperation.” It is mentionable that during the Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to work together against radicalization in an informal meeting with the former on October 11, this year. Nonetheless, it was only formality, shown in the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping Indian Prime Minister Modi, as in fact, Beijing supports Islamabad’s peaceful diplomacy in the region instead of extremist policy and New Delhi’s war-mongering diplomacy. Beijing is also opposed to India’s Kashmir move of August 5, 2019, which abrogated the special status of Kashmir and its decision to carve the Ladakh region out of Jammu and Kashmir State and administer it federally—China and India have a border dispute on Ladakh. We can conclude that P.M. Imran Khan’s successful visit to China along with General Qamar Javed Bajwa has strategic importance.

The statement comes weeks after Islamabad said Washington had asked it to mediate with Tehran. Khan last month described a request made by US President Donald Trump, asking the Pakistani leader to help defuse tensions with Iran, Reuters reports. Washington had blamed Tehran for an attack on the world’s biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. Tensions have elevated between Iran and Saudi Arabia since the attack, which took place on September 14. Yemen’s Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility, but Washington and Riyadh blame Iran. Iran denies involvement.
