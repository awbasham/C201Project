    "articleText": "Introduction There’s a story here. As it is told below, demons enter the famous, the chosen, those who take the deal. It’s a good story. The issue here is that we have seen the story below, in very very classified documents, no black eyes, no John McCain, but a very similar story of non-corporeal beings joining with the kind of people depicted below under circumstances exactly like we read of below, a curious coincidence. The issues behind this are ones of the nature of alien contact, were they here all along, long before people were people? If this is so, then the normal challenges to reality are superseded by something simpler and less contrived, that all spiritual life is an interaction of varying entities that play hockey with humanity and that the world’s religions are all metaphors. From Makow: “In their insane desire to have human bodies as their own, Aliens have perfected the ability to take a person’s soul out of their body and put it ‘elsewhere.'” The bizarre recurrence of facial bruises (and bandaged fingers) on Illuminati politicians and entertainers has resulted in speculation that their souls have been replaced in a satanic ritual called “soul scalping.” I do not believe in “aliens” unless we are speaking about a demonic spirit that has overcome the world elite. This is not a crazy conspiracy theory. Something very sinister has happened but no one wants to face it. Mankind has been colonized by a satanic cult. Here are excerpts from Sherry Shriner’s “The Prisoners of Dulce Base.” (Disclaimer- I don’t agree with Shriner’s assumptions about the Vatican and our “Judeo Christian” heritage.) by Sherry Shriner (Excerpts by henrymakow.com) There are two governments occupying the United States of America today. First, there is the traditional government established by our founding fathers, founded upon the constitution and an elected government, and there is the fascist-Bavarian-Illuminati backed “underground or shadow government” led by the Corporate-Military-Industrial government, which is fighting against traditional America on its own soil. In other words, the two sectors are the Judeo-Christian based Constitutional Republic of America and the Luciferian-cult-based Socialist empire of Bavaria, known as Bavarians or the Illuminati. (George W Bush) Perhaps as early as 1776, a gradual coup d’etat has been underway by Illuminati secret societies to undermine, overpower, and take over the traditional form of government in America and establish a fascist Luciferian dictatorship working under the guise of a New World Order. Over the last 70 years since 1933, this New World Order Shadow Government funded by American tax dollars and illegal drugs and weapons trades has been developed and implemented alongside our normal government but kept hidden and out of public view by a controlled media and their trained assassins. There is an inevitable war waiting between the elected surface government and those who will fight to defend it and the underground joint humanoid-reptilian-draconian New World Order if freedom is to be preserved. Over the past 40 years, the New World Order has successfully taken over the elections process to guarantee one of their followers is always elected as president. The American public has been deceived and played as fools by those who wish to destroy them from within. This joint alien-human domination is almost complete. (Kanye West) It is this joint alien-human government that has covertly undermined our elections process, lied to the American people, and have served as Presidents and many of our Congressmen since the 1970s. Secret Societies rule our government. Not one president has been elected for the past 30 years that was not a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission run by the Illuminati. The insignia of the Trilateral Commission is the same insignia seen on Alien aircraft. It is the fascist core of the NSA and CIA that has been the Illuminati’s arm of control and protection here in America. It is this core who protect information about these bases and the alien aspect of the shadow government from being exposed. It is this core that is the direct link, not only to the aliens who direct behind the scenes, but the Vatican itself that sits at the top of it all. Not the Pope himself, but the Black Pope position, the real power in the Vatican that is hidden behind the “white” Pope and is virtually the Seat of Lucifer himself. The Draconians, dragons, of which Satan is, run the Vatican and the Illuminati and they rule this alien-human empire via Lucifer from the Vatican. — SOUL SCALPING (Ryan Gosling) In their insane desire to have human bodies as their own, Aliens have perfected the ability to take a person’s soul out of their body and put it ‘elsewhere.’ This gives them access to a human body devoid of a soul. The body is a shell, a carcass, and they can take over and possess this body and use it for themselves. This is termed as “walking-in.” There are two types of walk-ins. Aliens can walk-in and possess a live human body, and/or a dead human, or in this instance, a live human who had their soul removed and then their body was taken over and walked-in by an alien. What happens to souls? What is a soul? A soul is what makes you-you. We are souls, and our bodies are just shells that cover our souls. Can we exist outside our bodies? Yes, as a spirit, in spirit form. The aliens are kidnapping humans and taking out their souls and then putting these souls in storage containers, even boxes, and then taking over the human bodies as their own. The person who was abducted and kidnapped is not dead. They are still alive, but now as a soul, they are trapped in that container or storage box they were put into. They become prisoners imprisoned in these storage containers with no way out. — (Prince Phillip) When George Bush Sr. first publicly announced the creation of the New World Order in 1991, he was in effect publicly announcing an alien take over of our nation and the replacement of our republic and constitution with a Luciferian and Alien dominant government. Related- For more pics and comments –see this twitter feed —Donald Marshall and the Cloning Station Marshall’s in-depth explanation of what body snatching is all about, and quite a bit different from the limited and skewed version which Shriner assembled —Aanirfan Aliens actually Demons – James Perloff 90% of people we see on TV are possessed – Sherry Shriner Soul Scalping by Sherry Shriner “They shove a small snake down your throat” First Comment by James C In many places, the New Testament indicates that demons, including Satan, can literally enter human beings (Luke 22:3). Likewise, on page 198 of his book The Biggest Secret, David Icke has several illustrations by Clive Burrows of what gifted psychics claim to be able to see, “reptiles of the lower fourth dimension” overshadowing world leaders in politics, banking, business, and the military. In her online book The Rainbow Swastika, Hannah Newman has a lengthy section on what she calls New Age “Walk-outs” and “Walk-ins.” She says that the “Walk-outs” are people who voluntarily allow themselves to be possessed by “Walk-ins.” Here is a quote from her book: In response to human need, some of these Masters become “Avatars” by occasionally taking up residence on the physical plane within a human host, known as “incarnation” (in their own body) or “overshadowing” (sharing the body with another soul). There are different degrees of overshadowing, ranging from divine impressions (resulting in channeling and dictation of “wisdom” literature) to the host actually “stepping out” of his body to allow the “master” full control. (see Bailey’s _A Treatise on Cosmic Fire_, p.756-757) This last stage transforms the outwardly normal-looking person into a body hosting an alien resident; the human owner is known in NA parlance as a “walk-out”, and the spirit-tenant is a benevolent “walk-in”. [Interesting that not even the toughest NA cynics question the motives or integrity of these strangers who ask us to surrender our rightful property to them. Is there such a thing as a spiritual “free lunch”? Read on.] A detailed explanation of the phenomenon is available in the landmark 1979 book: _Strangers Among Us: Enlightened Beings from a World to Come_, by Ruth Montgomery, a walk-in enthusiast. [Although outdated, it is useful in presenting the basics of this belief.] Montgomery, who claims to have received her information through channeling, writes: “Most Walk-ins zealously guard the secret of their altered identity, because people tend to fear” the phenomenon (p.47) and would launch “witchhunts” (p.125). But walk-ins can be identified by their unusual powers, including mind-reading, the power to “forestall” human activity (p.30) and the ability to insert thoughts into a human mind which he thinks are his own (p.71). [“Star Wars” fans will recall the ability of the “Jedi knight” to do all of these.] Montgomery was told that walk-ins number into the “tens of thousands [as of 1979]” (p.13), and she prophesies of a walk-in US President at some point (p.207). https://www.henrymakow.com/2019/06/soul-scalping.html Loading...

Big media is easy to intimidate by powerful people, even moreso when they might even own the media platform. But there is one catch. Anyone holding information on the exploitation of a minor who does not report it is guilty of the same level of felony as the perpetrator, via aiding and abetting. I first ran into this on a case where the mother’s live in boyfriend/husband was molesting her daughter, repeatedly, but mom did not want to lose her meal ticket. She was charged with a class A felony. This may have been state charges (NY), not federal, and it was over a decade ago. I am not aware of a media platform being prosecuted for aiding and abetting in holding something back like this. Did they pass it on to authorities but then did not report it? We don’t know, but it should be looked into thoroughly. Law enforcement is looking really bad here in what it did not do under obvious pressure from political people who had the squeeze put on them to kill any investigation or pay a heavy price for it.

Click to donate >> ABC NEWS – Amy Robach – First published … November 05, 2019 – ABC News knew the full extent of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes three years ago, but a combination of orders from above and threats from those implicated killed the story before it ever got to air, leaked footage shows. In a video clip released by conservative group Project Veritas on Tuesday, ABC News anchor Amy Robach is caught on a “hot mic” speaking to colleagues at the news desk Robach reveals that she had been contacted by Virginia Roberts (Giuffre), who alleges Epstein used her as a sex slave, and pimped her out to his powerful friends, including Britain’s Prince Andrew. “I’ve had this interview with Virginia Roberts…we would not put it on the air,” Robach says on camera. “First of all, I was told ‘who’s Jeffrey Epstein.’ Then the Palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways.” She told me everything. She had pictures, she had everything. It was unbelievable what we had. We had Clinton, we had everything. Former President Bill Clinton was among those who traveled multiple times on Epstein’s private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express.” As well as Clinton and Prince Andrew, Robach claims that lawyer Alan Dershowitz was implicated in Roberts’ testimony. Robach says that she tried to convince her bosses to air her story for three years, but “to no avail.” – “And now it’s all coming out and it’s like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it. What we had was unreal.” Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, where he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide, with the city’s chief medical examiner determining the sex offender hung himself from his bunk bed in the cell. Reports that Epstein had been taken off suicide watch two days earlier, and that the guards on watch left him unsupervised for longer than usual fueled rumors that foul play was afoot. Epstein’s connections to high profile political and business figures led many to speculate that the mogul was murdered. When New York’s former chief medical examiner, Dr. Michael Baden, claimed last month that Epstein’s wounds were more consistent with “homicidal strangulation” than suicide, the mystery was revived again, and the internet was flooded with “Epstein didn’t kill himself” memes and comments. Robach said she believes “100 percent” Epstein was murdered. Do I think he was killed? A hundred percent, yes I do. He made his whole living blackmailing people… There were a lot of men in those planes, a lot of men who visited that island, a lot of powerful men who came into that apartment. When Epstein died, the case against him died too, as the financier was the sole defendant. A group of Epstein’s accusers and alleged victims have called on prosecutors to keep the case open, arguing that his associates – including girlfriend and alleged trafficking partner Ghislaine Maxwell – could also be culprits. “Please, please finish what you have started … we all know he did not act alone,” accuser Sarah Ransome told a court hearing in New York in August. “We are all survivors, and the pursuit of justice should not abate.” Loading...

    "articleText": "\"And that includes the truth about Wikileaks\" - Jim W. Dean I’ve received a reply from my MP Alister Jack (who is also Secretary of State for Scotland). I asked him to obtain an explanation from our Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP, on concerns about the proceedings to extradite Julian Assange to the US, since he is the person accountable. But Mr Jack’s response doesn’t make clear whether the response is his and, if not, where it actually come from. I wanted to know… Why Assange is held under the inhuman conditions reserved for terrorists when he’s a journalist. How the Justice Department accounts for Assange’s poor physical and mental state. Why the question whether political offences are excluded from extradition under Article 4 of the UK/US Extradition Treaty hadn’t been not been addressed before these expensive proceedings began. Why Assange’s defence team haven’t been given easier access and more time to prepare. Why high-security Belmarsh is chosen for February’s hearing, where the opportunity for public scrutiny is minimal. And whether District Judge Baraitser will preside in February when, according to Craig Murray, she has already failed to behave impartially? In particular I wanted to know why, according to witnesses, Assange’s physical and mental states have deteriorated so rapidly while in the UK justice system’s care. There’s no attempt to answer most of these points. However, Mr Jack reminds me that Assange was jailed for 50 weeks on 1 May for breaching bail and holing up in the Ecuadore Embassy. “The UK’s criminal justice system is one in which rights are protected and in which, contrary to what Mr Assange and his supporters may claim, he and his interests will be protected,” writes Mr Jack brimming with confidence. But, he points out, the Home Secretary when signing an extradition warrant is limited in what he’s allowed to consider. For example, the Crime and Courts Act 2013 requires any judgement about human rights and health issues to be made in court. The administrative hearing on 21 October ruled that Assange will face a 5-day extradition hearing starting 25 February and, Mr Jack says, that’s when his human rights and poor health will be considered. It is for the judge to determine whether or not extradition would be a human rights breach and whether it would be oppressive and unjust on account of his state of health. In other words, nobody in the UK justice system could give a toss about Assange’s wellbeing for another 4 months – an awful long time when you’re already in bad shape and worried sick that you’ll wind up in Guantanamo Bay for….. for what, exactly? Former ambassador Craig Murray, a friend of Assange, attended the October hearing and reported that he was distressed by how his appearance had deteriorated after long confinement, and by his rapid ageing and stumbling speech — “the most articulate man, the fastest thinker, I have ever known” reduced to a “shambling and incoherent wreck”. Some have expressed concern that Assange may not live to the end of the extradition proceedings. From tomorrow MPs will cease to exist and Parliament will cease to function until after the general election on 12 December. So nobody is representing anybody in the cesspit of Westminster for the next 5 or 6 weeks. Stuart Littlewood 5 November 2019 Loading...

    "articleText": "www.pinterest.com The Disembodied Hand in Da Vinci’s “The Last Supper by Shelley Essak/Thought.Co Readers of Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code” will find an art history question posed about Leonardo Da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.” Is there an extra hand there that is not attached to anyone and is holding a dagger? If so, what could that mean? On page 248 of the novel, the spare hand is described as “disembodied. Anonymous.” The character notes, “if you count the arms, you’ll see that this hand belongs to…no one at all.” The supposedly spare hand is located between the third disciple from the left end of the table and the next seated disciple, in front of the body of the standing disciple. Counting the Arms in “The Last Supper” If you check a print of “The Last Supper” and count the arms of the disciples staged at the left end of the table, there are 12 arms which match the number of people. These are, from left to right, Bartholomew, James the Minor, Andrew (with his hands thrown up in a “stop” gesture), Judas (seated, face turned away), Peter (standing and angry), and John, whose feminine appearance is the subject of another set of questions.

The devices, found in virtually every police station in America, generate skewed results with alarming frequency, even though they are marketed as precise to the third decimal place. Judges in Massachusetts and New Jersey have thrown out more than 30,000 breath tests in the past 12 months alone, largely because of human errors and lax governmental oversight. Across the country, thousands of other tests also have been invalidated in recent years. The machines are sensitive scientific instruments, and in many cases they haven’t been properly calibrated, yielding results that were at times 40 percent too high. Maintaining machines is up to police departments that sometimes have shoddy standards and lack expertise. In some cities, lab officials have used stale or home-brewed chemical solutions that warped results. In Massachusetts, officers used a machine with rats nesting inside.

    "articleText": "Wizard Rock, a One-Ton Boulder, Disappears From Arizona’s Prescott National Forest by Brigit Katz/Smithsonian.com A hulking one-ton boulder known as Wizard Rock is one of the most popular landmarks in Arizona’s Prescott National Forest. Located along a highway that cuts through the sprawling property, the boulder is striking to behold—it’s black, with ribbons of white quartz running through it—and drivers often pull over to admire its beauty. Unfortunately, Elizabeth Wolfe and Saeed Ahmed report for CNN, Wizard Rock disappeared from its longtime spot on the side of the road around two weeks ago. Prescott National Forest staff announced the brazen theft in a recent statement appealing to the public for information on the boulder’s whereabouts. It is illegal to remove minerals from National Forest lands without a valid permit, and those who violate the rules face fines of up to $5,000 dollars or a six-month jail sentence. Some offenders receive both punishments. Permits are required to remove most items, including firewood, plants and trees, from forests. Because Wizard Rock is so large, staff believe the thief—or thieves—used heavy equipment to cart it away. “The easy way to do it would be a backhoe,” Jason Williams, Prescott’s trails and wilderness manager, tells Weldon B. Johnson of the Arizona Republic. “But, if you had a trailer positioned properly and didn’t mind beating some things up you might be able to do it with a Bobcat.

    "articleText": "Police veteran Jon Wedger explains in this in-depth interview the conspiracy of cover-ups that come from the top when the names of prominent people are discovered. He says that care homes, residential homes for children who have been separated from their families, were the source of sexual abuse and rape, and led to prostitution, drug abuse and other crimes. He was removed from a number of positions after uncovering child sex abuse, because police in top positions are complicit or covering up for politicians, celebrities and other powerful people. He was warned by the chief superintendent that child prostitution ran so deep with people who were connected that, if he continued to pursue the issue, he would lose his job, his house, and his children. After Wedger blew the whistle on police cover-ups, he was bullied and threatened. Wedger investigated the child-protection industry and discovered the lucrative business of privately run care homes that can pay owners over $2,500 per child per week. He says the abuse and prostitution in the care homes is an organized-crime operation involving high-ranking police and politicians. Wedger says the kids are being picked up from the care homes, abused, and then returned after the weekend. 80% of trafficking is within the family or those who have been given parental authority over the children. Sexual assault on children happens in all racial groups. All religious institutions have a problem with pedophilia but are protected by law enforcement. There is only a 2% prosecution rate on child prostitution. Currently, Wedger works with victims of abuse, campaigns for police whistleblowers and helps victims put cases back together after police cover them up. Victims have identified Edward (Ted) Heath, Britain’s Prime Minister from 1970 to 1974, as a sexual abuser of young boys from care homes, showing that abusers can reach the loftiest positions, in spite of (or perhaps because of) their crimes. This is a long interview but , if you want to know what it’s like in the real world of vice and human trafficking high in government, you cannot find a better source than this. Loading...

    "description": "How does a medical examiner distinguish between a hanging and ligature strangulation?",
    "articleText": "www.youtube.com Editor’s Note: We now have medical confirmation that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his cell by strangulation. The evidence is overwhelming and VT was right from day one, that Epstein was either murdered in his cell or that Robert David Steele’s hypothesis, that Epstein had a double there and he had long fled to Israel. Assuming this is Epstein, we can also assume that two sleeping guards may have been gassed and that a hit team strangled Epstein, as evidence now proves. The reason? We know for certain it is to protect Donald Trump. We don’t know that Trump ordered it but we can safely assume that it was done with his full knowledge. We got the smell long ago when Russiagate began, a fake investigation setup by Robert Mueller and William Barr, the “fixers” who covered for Nixon being owned by Roy Cohn, also Trump’s mentor and alleged gay lover. Cohn and Trump, who was dodging service in Vietnam Those aren’t the arms of an athlete and that eye makeup very much Liz Taylor. What are Trump’s secrets and did Epstein die to keep them? Health Editor’s Note: Veterans Today came out as soon as Jeffrey Epstein’s jail house death was announced with the concept that he was murdered and did not commit suicide as was alleged by those in charge of keeping Epstein safe for his future trial and/or for gathering information about his cohorts. If you search Veterans Today you will find many articles written about Epstein’s suspicious death. We are looking at someone (Epstein) who could have given information about others; from Prince Andrew of England, to Jean-Luc Brunel, (modeling agent), Alex Acosta, U.S. Secretary of Labor was once the U.S. Attorney for South Florida and we could go on…. What has been found is that physical forensic evidence supports death due to strangulation as opposed to suicide by hanging. Epstein would have had different injuries if he had indeed hung himself. The medical information in this article is easy to understand and shows without a doubt that Epstein was murdered and there is plenty of evidence to prove this…..Carol Jeffrey Epstein: Hanging or Strangulation? A forensic pathologist on the new accusations by Judy Meliniek, M.D./MedPage Today This week forensic pathologist Michael Baden opined on a Fox News morning show that Jeffrey Epstein, who died in a New York City jail while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, had injuries to his neck that were “unusual for suicidal hanging and more consistent with ligature homicidal strangulation.” Baden also shared with a website called Law & Crime a photograph and diagram, which he claims is from the Epstein postmortem investigation, showing the location of these fractures at the left hyoid greater cornu and bilateral thyroid cartilage cornua. Baden, a Fox News analyst, said he was making himself available to these press outlets because Mark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein’s brother and Baden’s client, does not believe that the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, which determined the manner of death to be suicide, had performed a thorough-enough investigation. Mark Epstein wants to know what information prompted the medical examiner to conclude that the manner was suicide after it had been, first, “pending further study.” Baden told his Fox News colleagues that he believes that the FBI needs to conduct DNA testing on the torn bedsheet that was used as the ligature. So, how likely are fractures of the hyoid and thyroid in cases of hangings? A retrospective study of 175 cases of suicidal hangings over a five-year period found that fractures of the hyoid bone and associated cartilages — the injuries the medical examiner found in Jeffrey Epstein’s throat — were detected in 68% of cases, and that the proportion of fractures increased with the age of the deceased. A prospective study of 40 cases of suicidal hangings over a three-year period found fractures of neck structures in 19 cases (47.5%), more commonly in the study’s older men. Six of those decedents (15%) had fractures of both the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. In the most recently published series, fractures of the neck skeleton were present in 72.5% of suicidal hangings. The data revealed in the peer-reviewed scientific literature does not support Baden’s statement that “hanging does not cause these broken bones, and homicide does.” How does a medical examiner distinguish between a hanging and ligature strangulation?

    "articleText": ".1kt tactical nuclear weapons test at Dimona VT has information that Israel is arming its drones with small tactical nuclear weapons. The photo above is of a test of a low yield nuclear weapon tested inside Israel. The photo is taken from a leaked Israeli video of their secret nuclear weapons program, weapons that have been used inside Syria in support of ISIS. The weapons themselves are a technological achievement made through spying on the US nuclear weapons program through infiltration of the directorship of the US Department of Energy though its last 3 heads, all according to our sources, working as Israeli spies. This is the highest classified photo ever published. Sputnik News: Tensions between Israel and the Lebanon-based political and militant group escalated this summer after an Israeli drone attack on a media office belonging to the movement in Beirut, which later led to a series of border clashes. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has dubbed the Thursday attack on an Israeli drone operating in southern Lebanon part of an “effort to clean up” Lebanese skies. Speaking to his supporters in Beirut on Friday, Nasrallah boasted that “bringing down UAVs is a natural matter,” adding that “our goal is to purge Lebanese skies of Israeli violations”. The Hezbollah leader vowed that the group “will continue to act in this way, regardless of internal developments in Lebanon,” referring to the ongoing protests facing the country, adding that the Thursday attack on an Israeli drone “proved” Hezbollah’s willingness to use its advanced defences. “Israel is confident that we will not dare to use the weapons we used yesterday – but the resistance proves that it is daring,” Nasrallah said. Nasrallah did not name the weapon used to attack the Israeli drone. Drone Operations On Thursday, Lebanese media reported that an Israeli drone had been fired upon and possibly shot down outside a town in southern Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Forces soon responded, saying that an anti-aircraft missile had been fired, but did not hit the UAV. Hezbollah later confirmed that the missile attack had ‘forced the drone to leave’ the area. A week earlier, in a separate incident, the Israeli military confirmed that one of its small drones had crashed in Lebanon during “routine security activity”. Another Israeli drone crashed in southern Lebanon in September, with Hezbollah claiming its air defences had shot it down. An Israeli army Heron unmanned drone aircraft Israel has regularly deployed drones and manned aircraft inside Lebanese airspace, targeting both Hezbollah and points in neighbouring Syria. Israel has justified its operations by accusing Iran of waging a proxy war against Tel Aviv, and in addition to Lebanon and Syria, has struck ‘Iran-backed targets’ in Iraq and the Gaza Strip. Lebanon has repeatedly slammed Israel’s operations in its airspace, stating that these violate the country’s sovereignty and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which brought an end to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. On 1 September, Israeli launched massed mortar, artillery and air strikes in southern Lebanon following a Hezbollah anti-tank missile barrage targeting Israeli Defence Forces positions along the disputed border area. In August, Hezbollah accused the Israelis of dropping firebombs on a Lebanese grove near the border, flying small drones into Beirut to bomb a Hezbollah media office, and attacking a position on the Syria-Lebanon border which Israel claimed was used as a transit point for militants. Last month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured Israel that it had a “fundamental right to engage in activity that ensures the security of its people”, whether this be inside Israeli territory or elsewhere in the region.

    "articleText": "RT: A supposed champion of the rule of law, the US is violating its own anti-Syrian sanctions by smuggling crude from oil fields it seized from Damascus, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has said. Each month the US smuggles crude worth $30 million out of Syria, according to Zakharova. The fuel comes from fields in the northeastern part of the country, where the US maintains a military presence after pulling its troops back from the Syrian-Turkish border. “A nation that repeats ad nauseam that it sticks to democratic values and rule of law in international relations, is pumping oil… under a pretense of fighting ISIL,” the official said, using an outdated name for terrorist group Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). ISIL had been fully destroyed in March this year, according to the statements of the coalition. The narrative of the Americans doesn’t hold water. Oil fields in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate, east of the River Euphrates, were captured by US-backed Kurdish militias as they advanced on IS forces. Washington makes no secret of the fact that it keeps an illegal military presence in the area in order to deny Damascus access to the natural resources that it has every right to possess under international law. ALSO ON RT.COM Trump channels ‘America invades for oil’ meme as he says some troops will stay in Syria to ‘protect’ it The US considers the Syrian government illegitimate and has used various means to attempt to topple it over the past eight years, from imposing harsh economic sanctions to arming and training whoever was willing to fight against Damascus. The fact that the US banned oil trade with Syria and is now smuggling oil out of it is particularly ironic, Zakharova said. Loading...

A convoy of SUVs taking American Mormon families to a wedding in the Mexican state of Chihuahua was attacked by armed gunmen, with two of the dead reported to be 8-month-old twins.

    "articleText": "…from PressTV, Tehran [ Editor’s Note: Both Turkey and the Kurds are testing the limits of the N Syria withdrawal zone. As with the JCPOA, I fear we will see a permanent scourge in the future of parties interpreting however they wish as to fulfilling their obligations. This is totally unnecessary as agreements are contracts and contract law has a long history. An international body could be set up to rule on whether a party is not abiding by a contract, or even both. But this would be a fruitless effort if no one really abides by such agreements anymore. They just pretend they are. I would suggest that such agreements require bonds to be posted, as we have a long history of doing in business situations where a breach of contract has to be indemnified, which a bankrupt party cannot due. Turkey was going to violate the agreement from the beginning, because it knew the Kurds would then not fully withdraw, so Erdogan could do what he is doing now, charging them with a breach. But when both side do it that equals the playing field. For domestic consumption each claims the other is in violation no matter how ridiculous the charge. How do they get away with that? Simple. You have to control the media, which Erdogan does in the current example, and the Israel Lobby does in the US on all issues of key interest to Israel. Erdogan takes it to comical levels, complaining about the Syrian Kurdish terrorist threat when he has been supporting terrorism inside Syria since early in the war, thinking he could use it to wrest the old Turkish Empire portion of NE Syria, including Aleppo, back into the new Erdogan Empire. But even that is somewhat of a hoax. He is really after all the oil and gas under Idlib. And if the offshore deposits which VT has been told land there they can be claimed by the “current holder”, the economic pressures on Turkey which are the only real threat to Erdogan’s iron clasp hold over the country would be solved.

Thanks for helping. Click to donate >> Erdogan does so love to play Sultan – First published … November 11, 2019 – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says militants from the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) have not fully withdrawn from border areas of the so-called safe zone in northern Syria as specified in the agreements with Russia and the United States, and that US forces are still carrying out joint patrols with the militants. “We know that there are still terrorists in the planned safe zone. These areas are not cleared of terrorists. Terrorists have not been taken out of either (the northwestern Syrian cities of) Tal Rifaat or Manbij,” Erdogan told a parliamentary group meeting of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in the capital Ankara on Tuesday. He added that the militants beyond the safe zone borders were organizing attacks on Turkish security forces. “We will not be an onlooker to this situation. We will do what is necessary as we did before. “Turkey will continue its fight until the last terrorist is neutralized in Turkey, Syria and Iraq,” Erdogan said. The Turkish president highlighted that Ankara would abide by its deals as long as Washington and Moscow kept their promises. Erdogan said that US forces were still holding joint patrols with the YPG militants inside the 30-kilometers border strip from which the Kurdish forces were supposed to withdraw. “How can we explain America holding patrols with terrorist organizations in this region even though they made the decision to withdraw? This is not in our agreement,” he said. He also criticized the US for being insincere regarding Turkey’s anti-terror efforts. “We have been subjected to a hidden embargo for fighting against terrorists,” Erdogan said, referring to some western countries’ refusal to sell weapons and other devices in the wake of the Turkish cross-border incursion into northern Syria. Turkey, Russia conduct 2nd round of joint Syria patrols Also on Tuesday, Turkish and Russian troops in armored vehicles conducted the second round of joint patrols in northern Syria near the Kurdish-populated town of Kobani, officially Ayn al-Arab, under a deal that has forced YPG militants away from Turkey’s border. According to Turkey’s Defense Ministry, Turkish and Russian military elements and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) participated in the patrol, which lasted two hours. Syrian army starts deploying units to Qamishli Meanwhile, Syria’s official news agency SANA reported that units of government forces are being deployed to the eastern countryside of the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli on the border with Turkey in the face of a cross-border incursion by Turkish army troops and their allied militants against Kurdish YPG forces. On October 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart signed a memorandum of understanding that asserted YPG militants must withdraw from the Turkish-controlled “safe zone” in northeastern Syria within 150 hours, after which Ankara and Moscow will run joint patrols around the area. The announcement was made hours before a US-brokered five-day truce between Turkish and Kurdish-led forces was due to expire. On October 9, Turkish military forces and Ankara-backed militants launched a long-threatened cross-border invasion of northeastern Syria in a declared attempt to push YPG militants from border areas. Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984. The YPG constitutes the backbone of the Kurdish-dominated so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "\"And that includes the truth about Wikileaks\" - Jim W. Dean I’ve received a reply from my MP Alister Jack (who is also Secretary of State for Scotland). I asked him to obtain an explanation from our Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP, on concerns about the proceedings to extradite Julian Assange to the US, since he is the person accountable. But Mr Jack’s response doesn’t make clear whether the response is his and, if not, where it actually come from. I wanted to know… Why Assange is held under the inhuman conditions reserved for terrorists when he’s a journalist. How the Justice Department accounts for Assange’s poor physical and mental state. Why the question whether political offences are excluded from extradition under Article 4 of the UK/US Extradition Treaty hadn’t been not been addressed before these expensive proceedings began. Why Assange’s defence team haven’t been given easier access and more time to prepare. Why high-security Belmarsh is chosen for February’s hearing, where the opportunity for public scrutiny is minimal. And whether District Judge Baraitser will preside in February when, according to Craig Murray, she has already failed to behave impartially? In particular I wanted to know why, according to witnesses, Assange’s physical and mental states have deteriorated so rapidly while in the UK justice system’s care. There’s no attempt to answer most of these points. However, Mr Jack reminds me that Assange was jailed for 50 weeks on 1 May for breaching bail and holing up in the Ecuadore Embassy. “The UK’s criminal justice system is one in which rights are protected and in which, contrary to what Mr Assange and his supporters may claim, he and his interests will be protected,” writes Mr Jack brimming with confidence. But, he points out, the Home Secretary when signing an extradition warrant is limited in what he’s allowed to consider. For example, the Crime and Courts Act 2013 requires any judgement about human rights and health issues to be made in court. The administrative hearing on 21 October ruled that Assange will face a 5-day extradition hearing starting 25 February and, Mr Jack says, that’s when his human rights and poor health will be considered. It is for the judge to determine whether or not extradition would be a human rights breach and whether it would be oppressive and unjust on account of his state of health. In other words, nobody in the UK justice system could give a toss about Assange’s wellbeing for another 4 months – an awful long time when you’re already in bad shape and worried sick that you’ll wind up in Guantanamo Bay for….. for what, exactly? Former ambassador Craig Murray, a friend of Assange, attended the October hearing and reported that he was distressed by how his appearance had deteriorated after long confinement, and by his rapid ageing and stumbling speech — “the most articulate man, the fastest thinker, I have ever known” reduced to a “shambling and incoherent wreck”. Some have expressed concern that Assange may not live to the end of the extradition proceedings. From tomorrow MPs will cease to exist and Parliament will cease to function until after the general election on 12 December. So nobody is representing anybody in the cesspit of Westminster for the next 5 or 6 weeks. Stuart Littlewood 5 November 2019 Loading...

Thanks for helping. Click to donate >> – First published … November 03, 2019 – Nord Stream 2 got the green flag from the Danish government to connect with the landing station at Lubmin, Germany. The decision was melodramatic from the Danes, with a route just outside its territorial waters in an area considered safe from environmental concerns. Denmark’s Energy Agency said it was “obliged to allow the construction of transit pipelines” under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. While the champagne corks were flying at Gazprom in Russia, there was gnashing of teeth in the US. Trump said Nord Stream 2 would make Germany “a hostage of Russia”, in the usual mode of Trump overstatement. Not everyone is happy with the deal Thus ends some of the controversy for now, with US attempts to kill the pipeline having thrown everything but the kitchen sink in the way of its completion. That included a direct threat from the number one sanctionista, Mr. Trump, who said that all the European companies involved would face US sanctions. Trump already was holding a general sanctions sword over Europe with his campaign promise to rebalance EU-US trade. European companies were heavily invested in the land construction part of the project and distribution, so Trump thought he had a lot of leverage. Although some understood Trump’s thinking the EU should be obliged to buy US LNG at whatever price to show good faith that it would cooperate in reducing the US trade imbalance, EU countries did not look at that as a feasible strategy with the EU’s sluggish economic growth. The Trump threat baton seems to have been passed to the DOE now. “The Department of Energy strongly believes that the Nord Stream 2 threatens the energy security and national security of U.S. allies in Europe [and] strengthens Russia’s control over the region’s energy supply,” said a DOE spokesperson, speaking on background. “The United States will continue to look into all tools at its disposal regarding this project… All options are on the table.” Ukraine’s gas transit contract expires December 31st Ukraine was next in line with being unhappy, with Zelensky stating, “This is not only a matter of energy security, it is a geopolitical issue,”… the deal “strengthens Russia and weakens Europe.” It seems Mr. Zelensky has taken a lesson from Trump, that other countries should do their bidding. “We understood this could happen”, he said in Kiev. Lurking in the background for Mr. Z is Ukraine’s gas transit contract expiring at the end of the year, with not much time left to negotiate a new deal. Ukraine and Poland have been in full hostile mode, both having held the transit pipeline hostage or abused it in the past, which is something that corporate media seems to have erased from its memory banks. Eastern Europe is concerned with the Turkish-Russian pipeline eventually heading to Southern Europe, as it could find itself losing the valuable gas transit fees via the Ukraine route. They are crying crocodile tears, as they only have their own Russo-phobia to blame for the current hostilities, with Poland having cooperated with NATO’s march to Russia’s western border. We must not forget that the current Ukrainian government was the result of the murderous US-backed Maidan coup, where imported snipers shot both police and protesters, and where Julia Tymoshenko was phone-tapped saying she wanted to nuke Donbass and then nuke Russia. With neighbors like this, who needs enemies? A transit deal of some sort will be worked out with Ukraine. The EU is supporting negotiations, but the price details have yet to be worked out; and Russia would like to add in the $3-billion debt from the Stockholm arbitration for a package deal. Both countries realize that disruption of energy supplies would hurt both of their reputations as reliable suppliers and transit countries. The Deal that almost never was Nord Stream 2 will be remembered for its trial by fire. The EU was jammed up politically on approving the deal, and it was Angela Merkel that came to the rescue. She could not do it without Macron, so they worked out an “anti-monopoly” solution where, once the gas landed in Germany, it would come under the EU regulations for distribution, the key demand for detractors. There were concerns that without that regulation control, Gazprom could charge countries that had been hostile to Russia more than those who had been friendly. But that turned out to be a false concern, as Russia accepted EU distribution regulation and the EU holdouts were comfortable. Nord Stream gas could be flowing in early 2020 Because the German land part of the pipeline is already completed, it is expected that gas will be flowing through early next year. That said, Europe’s gas storage has been filled to capacity in anticipation of Nord Stream 2 delays, so the first shipments will come at a time of oversupply and some of the lowest gas prices in many years. And it could not happen at a better time. The EU is looking at an overall weak growth rate of 1.2% this year. Germany was at 0.4% on the late summer third quarter numbers. An oversupply of gas has prices lower than in a long time, or these growth numbers would be even lower. The EU is juggling with Boris Johnson’s dancing Brexit deal, where both sides are weary; the wise men on both sides do not want to see a hard Brexit which will hurt both. The EU leadership needs the Nord Stream deal to show that it has at least been able to stabilize the EU energy supply for years to come. Russia seems to be happy to deliver at low prices as a win-win for both sides and to make US LNG less attractive. What is Trump going to do now? Many in the US could never understand how Trump thought that he could sell the more expensive LNG when the EU did not have the infrastructure set up to handle it, and Trump seemed tone deaf to the issue of why EU customers would want to pay a premium for US gas. All I can think of is that he thought he could roll the EU buying US LNG into an overall trade deal, similar to what he is doing with the Chinese in the soon to be signed stage one part of that deal. China will commit to buying $50 billion a year in US agricultural products. Trump hopes he can parlay this deal into enough votes from Mid-west farmers to win a second presidential term and avoid prosecution over some of his legal problems. The US will still be looking for ways to make trouble for Nord Stream and the EU, as it likes to be able to show that those that resist US unipolarism do not fare well. Will it sanction the EU Nord Stream partner countries? What would the EU do if it did? We will all have to wait for those answers. But who knows? With the US in the middle of an impeachment process, the Trump regime may have better things to spend its time on. Jim W.

According to the publication, the Russian military is interested in leasing the Qamishli Airport for a duration of 49 years. “The reason for the need to rent another military airfield in Syria for almost half a century is unknown, especially since the Al-Qamishli airfield is located only 500km from the Russian Hmeimim Airbase; however, experts believe that it will be a kind of control center for American missiles stationed in the Middle East,” the publication said. “If we allow the deployment of Russian air defense and missile defense systems in the Al-Qamishli area, then American missiles, if the latter are deployed in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, etc., will be intercepted long before they are launched towards Russia ” a specialist told Avia.Pro. Moscow has not yet made any official statements on this subject.

Not only did we see the sad spectacle once again of the Israel Lobby “interfering” in the US politically, but then delivering a “two-fer” for Israel, supporting its support for the Kurds to continue being a destabilizing force in Syria, Turkey and Iraq, all to the glee of the extremist Zionists. The UN continues to dance around the edges of the problem, focusing on everything but the main issue of the number of member countries in violation of the UN charter on respecting the sovereignty of other members. By not even denouncing what has been going on under the scourge of Uni-polarism the UN has undermined its own foundation. When is the last time you heard of the UN offering to put “peacekeepers” into conflict border areas? Why would not the UN offer to guard Syria’s oil as an unbiased partner and undercut the US phony ruse of protecting those oil fields from ISIS? It is because member countries would not commit troops, or that they feel they would be useless because parties in the conflict would just take their weapons away and hold them as hostages? The UN’s reputation is going down the tubes due to the “spectator” role it has taken on the Syrian crisis in not denouncing US coalition use of proxy terrorism.

Click to donate >> Only Russia stepped in to bust of the gold rush oil tanker theft of Syrian oil through Iraq and Turkey, something that VT pointed out could be seen from the moon with a hobby telescope. – First published … November 11, 2019 – In the name of what the US president called “securing the oil” or what the Pentagon chose to describe as an attempt to “protect” Syria’s oil, the US is basically indulging in what can, in simple terms, be described as purposeful pillaging of Syria’s natural resources. There are three objectives that the US aims to achieve through this “control” of Syria’s oil. First, it can thwart all attempts towards Syria’s territorial reunification under Damascus. Secondly, it can keep a lid on a critical source of Syria’s economy and can thus thwart Syria’s economic recovery and reconstruction. Thirdly, by “controlling” the oil, the US can clip Kurds and prevent their bid to make a deal with the Russians and the Syrians for integration with Damascus; hence, Pentagon’s “warning” to everyone—Russians and Syrians in particular—-against any attempts at recovering the oil fields. This, however, is equally going to make US-Turkey rapprochement extremely difficult, if not impossible. The US, by deciding to directly control Syria’s oil, has re-intensified its geopolitical struggle in and around Syria. The US position close to the critical M2 Baghdad-Damascus highway indicates how it intends to stay militarily engaged in the Levant after the defeat of the Islamic State and Syria’s strong drive, supported as it is by Russia and Iran, towards re-establishing Damascus’ authority all over Syria. During the recently concluded NATO summit in Brussels, Esper confirmed that that the US is sending an unspecified number of troops and materiel to “guard the oil fields” held presently by Kurdish forces, adding also that reinforcements “will continue until we believe we have sufficient capability” [to hold the oil fields for as long as we want]. The decision to “control” oil fields has, unsurprisingly enough, come at a time when Russia, Iran and Turkey, have advanced well enough into bringing peace to Syria and creating a new constitution. Even the Syria opposition groups have confidently said that a political deal will be clinched next year. According to co-chair Hadi al-Bahra, “I hope that the 75th anniversary of the United Nations next year will be an opportunity to celebrate another achievement by the universal organization, namely the success of efforts under the auspices of a special envoy for political process, who will bring peace and justice to all Syrians.” The joint statement released after a meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey in Geneva emphasised the same. All the parties, said the statement, “Confirmed the continued commitment of the guarantor countries of the Astana format to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic.” Even if a deal happens, lack of enough resources available to rebuild Syria will start causing new crisis, weakening Damascus’ hands. A “struggle for resources” might tear Syria apart. Given the US plan that goes specifically to this direction and mindful of the consequences that a minus-oil Syria will have to face, Russia is all the more critical of US policies. With the Russian foreign minister calling US policies “arrogant”, “illegal” and a violation of international law, the tempo for intense geo-political struggle has been set. This puts the US on one side, and the Astana countries on the other. Notwithstanding the US ‘permission’ to let Turkey do its military operation in Syria, the fact that the US has once again started supporting Kurds (although it is more like thwarting Kurdish attempts to make peace with Damascus) means that Ankara will have some serious objections to it. This puts Russia, Iran and Turkey on the same page, reinforcing the Astana peace process. Turkey, without any doubt, will see in the US “control” of Syrian oil fields and a tactical support for Kurds a threat to its interests… a process that might continue to gain momentum towards the ultimate objective of creating an autonomous Kurdistan in Syria – a territory that is supposed to become the bedrock of US and Israeli activities in the whole region. This means that the prospects of a US-Turkey rapprochement will become a lot weaker than they seemed three weeks ago. There can perhaps be nothing more inflammatory to the Turkish national security establishment and public alike than collaboration between Kurdish militias and a NATO ally, the US. Within Turkey’s national security calculation, this collaboration can have no objective other than breaking Turkey from within and creating an independent state of Kurdistan in the Middle East. The US’ renewed attempts at creating a mess in Syria through controlling the life-line of its economy is, therefore, going to have many consequences that will, once again, leave it surrounded by foes (Russia and Iran) and estranged allies (Turkey). It is obvious that the bid to control Syria’s oil has nothing with the fight against terrorism; it signifies a renewed US geo-political struggle to stay alive in the Middle East – something that no country in the region, save Israel and Saudi Arabia, will appreciate and welcome.

    "articleText": "Submitted by Heinz Pommer with Jeff Prager to Veterans Today Introduction by Gordon Duff with Ian Greenhalgh and Jeff Smith (Nuclear weapons designer/particle physicist) The material here is overwhelming, hours of lectures and dozens of detailed slides. This is not an easy read. It is another piece of irrevocable proof regarding 9/11 and the use of nuclear weapons and, on its own, worth much more than just scanning or flipping through. * Architects and engineers say planes don’t knock down skyscrapers. Nuclear physicists say only atomic bombs can turn out this kind of heat and damage. The real investigators who were silenced by a grand jury and a wealth of threats said it was a conspiracy and named lots of names, some expected, some not. Now an independent physicist has proven the work done by the original investigators who were silenced and much new work as well. His modeling and detail is breathtaking. We were recently introduced to the work of Germany physicist Heinz Pommer. I chose to contact him. His work deeply parallels work done by the US Department of Energy and IAEA which was censored and suppressed so that the fake 9/11 report could be published and blame put on Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike Pommer’s work (aided by Jeff Prager), the VT team included some of those involved in the ill fated original investigation. Working from different data, to an extent, both teams have ended up with nearly identical results. https://www.veteranstoday.com/2018/09/25/the-secret-history-of-9-11/ VT knows the who, how and when from official sources. Pommer (and Prager), however, have taken their portion a step further and have produced what the original team would have presented to congress and the president, had they been allowed, of the proofs of nuclear weapons and their effects. Their work is identical to the secret work by the DOE and Sandia National Labs but adds much as well. Included are video presentations sent by Pommer to me and his PDF slides. This material has been submitted to the US team and we will get their comments. 6.3 Demon’s trap 9/11 Your mind is not your consciousness. Your consciousness is your state or quality of awareness of your existence, of being a person. Your mind, however, can be hijacked and controlled. Your thoughts can be guided to this and that, and finally your mind might simply play the role of an uneducated dog. It barks a lot: “be aware, intruders!” If your mind is bent the right way (in the sense of the perpetrators of 9/11) you will accept nothing except the fairy tale of Osama bin Laden. Then your mind and your thoughts will clutch and grasp to the last straws, in order to save your world view. It will accept nothing, least of all an offending truth. Truth, however, is important. So, lets start this subchapter rendering homage to one great defender of the truth, Saint Augustine of Hippo. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD) Saint Augustine of Hippo from Numidia (a Roman province on the North African Coast) was in a certain sense an extremist, whose position could be condensed in the phrase: “Better to fall with the truth than to stand with the lie.” He knew Rome well, as he would recognize Rome in modern western society in his splendor and cruelty. Victory at all costs. The truth does not matter, the triumph of the lie is omnipresent and masked – if at all – by the cosy word “illusion”. To understand the essence of truth – love of God’s creation by all beings – he also studied the lie, defining how these two antipodes reveal themselves in human society. The next pages show 25 steps in which the destruction process of the South Tower and the processes in the ground are sketched. These sketches did offend many people and were harshly criticized as “fantasy sketches”, or even as a “dangerous effort to deceive the public”. However, these sketches should be regarded only as a playful approach in an effort to understand a physical process and to calculate a more precise model afterwards. They don’t pretend being “The Truth”. For a conscious person, there is nothing offensive in them. Even if your mind tells you so.

Is the Trump-flub disease spreading down into the State Department? To say that the US is committed to the region and then Trump does not show up, not even a VP or Secretary of State for the 2nd time in a row, rings hollow. Domestic diplomats are supposed to guide an “unprepared” leader through the protocol on how not to make goofs like this. This is what happens when you have a president that is “winging it” and is uncomfortable with being “corrected”. He is intimidated by experienced professional staff who know a lot more than he does, so he brings in political flunkies, as they are good butt-kissers. The country gets hurt in the process with avoidable silliness like this happening. I would suspect that Trump is really focused on not only “impeachment one”, which is coming up, but “impeachment two” waiting in the wings when his appeals run out on the New York attorney general wanting his tax returns. It will be harder for the Senate Repubs to brush that off, since an appeals court has ruled that a sitting president is not immune from criminal prosecution. The whole idea of releasing tax returns ahead of time was to avoid such issues even coming up. Everyone before Trump had released their returns. Trump had a good reason for not showing his; and I think we are all going to find out why. Many of his legal cases that were handled civilly, like his school scam.

Click to donate >> Modern Bangkok – First published … November 11, 2019 – President Trump did not attend this year’s Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, with the US represented instead by his national security advisor, Robert O’Brien. A US diplomat has voiced Washington’s ‘extreme’ concern over the move by the majority of ASEAN’s leaders not to personally attend a special ASEAN-US summit on Monday. “We are extremely concerned by the apparent decision,” the diplomat said, commenting on the snub, his remarks quoted by Kyodo News. “A full or partial boycott by ASEAN leaders will be seen as an intentional effort to embarrass the President of the United States of America and this will be very damaging to the substance of the ASEAN-US relations,” the diplomat added. The heads of state and government of seven of ASEAN’s ten members moved to skip the ASEAN-US Summit slated to take place on Monday. The leaders of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines downgraded their representation at Monday’s summit with the US by sending only their foreign ministers, with only a ‘troika’ comprising the prime ministers of Thailand, Vietnam and Laos showing up to the meeting with O’Brien. The demonstrative decision was made on Friday, according to diplomatic sources cited by Kyodo News. The downgraded presence appeared to be tied to President Trump’s decision not to personally attend the ASEAN Leaders Summit and East Asian Summit in Bangkok on November 2-4, and not to send the vice president or the secretary of state in his place. – An ASEAN source confirmed to Kyodo News that the bloc of nations was “upset with US President Trump who decided to skip the meeting,” adding that the view was that Trump “should at least send a representative who is in the cabinet. Such a gesture may set a bad example for other dialogue partners in the future.” – US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did travel to Bangkok along with O’Brien, where he said that the Trump administration was “extremely engaged in and fully committed to this region.” This was the second year in a row that Trump has failed to show up at the annual gathering of Southeast Asian nations. Last year, Vice President Mike Pence attended the 33rd ASEAN Summit in Singapore. Trump attended the summit in Manila, the Philippines in 2017. Late last week, following reports that Trump would not attend the Bangkok Summit, Panitan Wattanayagorn, chairman of the security advisory committee for Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, told the Bangkok Post that there were a number of possible reasons for Trump to skip summits.

    "title": "Abu Mohammad Salama Killed? Did Zionists & Kurds Deceive Trump?",
    "description": "Is This The Beginning of the End for Israel?",
    "articleText": "TEHRAN – Robert David Steele, a former Marine Corps infantry officer and CIA spy as well as an activist for Open Source Everything Engineering (OSEE), regularly answers questions for Tehran Times. Q. Within minutes of President Donald Trump’s announcement of an alleged raid that allegedly killed an alleged ISIS leader known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, skeptical commentary emerged. What is your summary appreciation? A. Let me begin by saying that people I trust tell me that the raid was very real, with helicopters flying 50 feet above the ground at 130 knots. The cost of the raid has been estimated at $30 million. What does not appear to be real are the actual location, and the actual identity of the person we claim was killed. I am among those who denounced the fake Bin Ladens including the last one provided by the Pakistani military as a gift to help Barack Obama win re-election. We sent men to their death for political theater. I knew immediately that this latest alleged raid was a fake, but chose to start with a headline, “Russia says Baghdadi killing faked by US [& Israel],” credited to Gordon Duff, founding editor of Veterans Today. Gordon, whom I know personally, has a rich network of contacts on the ground, including Russian military commanders as well as honest Jews who despise Zionist provocations and lies. The official Russian denunciation of the raid as having never happened is a matter of record. To that I add the earlier reported death of Al-Baghdadi in 2015 in an Israeli hospital, and the alleged but credible aspect of al-Baghdadi being a Mossad operative and Israeli citizen named Elliot Shimon, and you have the perfect storm. I believe the Zionists and the US neo-conservative lied to President Donald Trump, faked the entire raid, faked the alleged DNA testing, and have now put the President in a terrible spot. Accepting that our Special Forces carried out a raid – somewhere — either al-Baghdadi / Elliot Shimon is still alive as Gordon suggests, and the death was faked; or al-Baghdadi died in 2015 and this new death was faked – someone else was killed. I think our President has been lied to. A deeply suspicious person would also wonder if this is not a potential “kill shot” by Benjamin Netanyahu against Trump – here is what Ha’aretz says, in “Trump Basks in al-Baghdadi’s Bloody Assassination, but the Festivities Will End Shortly,” Trump is bound to be criticized for his blood-thirsty style, as well as the fact that he hurried to announce al-Baghdadi’s demise before the Pentagon had signed off on final and incontrovertible DNA proof that the ISIS leader had indeed been killed. On the extremely unlikely chance that al-Baghdadi will emerge somewhere safe and sound, which has happened before, Trump would instantly transform, not into a lame-duck but into a dead duck. The above tells me two things: that the DNA was not confirmed as the President claimed; and that Benjamin Netanyahu might well choose one day to “resurrect” Elliot Shimon aka al-Baghdadi, as a reprisal for the Miriam Adelson Medal of Freedom that set the stage for her public denouncement of Netanyahu’s wife as crazy and Netanyahu as a servant to his wife – this cost him dearly. Interestingly, a separate new story has emerged about Israel now considering Donald Trump an unreliable enemy of Israel, and the likelihood that LtCol Alexander Vindman is a Zionist tool – he is a Jewish-American now betraying the President with false testimony to Congress favoring impeachment. I am inclined to agree with this assessment and believe that Benjamin Netanyahu has Elliot Shimon aka al-Baghdadi tucked away for re-emergence – a miniature “Samson option” against the President. Pablo Escobar, writing in The Saker, “Caliph closure: ‘He died like a dog’,” says this: According to ground sources in Syria, a prevalent rumor in Idlib is that the “dead dog” in Barisha could be Abu Mohammad Salama, the leader of Haras al-Din, a minor sub-group of al-Qaeda in Syria. Haras al-Din has not issued any statement about it. I conclude that the raid happened, that Mossad operative Elliot Shimon aka al-Baghdadi was not present; that the Kurds, on behalf of the Zionists, provided fake DNA samples before and after; and that whoever died was not in fact, the alleged target, who was not a real terrorist leader, to begin with. The worst-case analysis is that President Donald Trump has been “schlonged” by Benjamin Netanyahu personally, the Zionists generally, and their controlled Kurdish paramilitary servants. There is, however, a best case analysis that the French shadow foreign minister has shared with me, and I include it in the spirit of deference to the opinion of others. His view is that this was a deliberately fake raid intended to not only achieve a political bounce across a largely ignorant public, but to set the stage for the “treasure trove” of intelligence actually obtained elsewhere, that crucifies Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Brennan and Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff and Chuck Schumer among others, for having created ISIS and conspired with Israel as well as Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria. My French colleague observes that the surprise travel of Pelosi and Schiff to Jordan and Afghanistan; the closure of all Israeli embassies and consulates immediately after the raid (ostensibly over a labor dispute, but 100% closure suggests government direction), and the resurfacing of the Epstein story with what I consider to be a falsified autopsy conclusion of murder all suggest that in conjunction with the forthcoming FISA criminal indictments, President Trump is getting ready for a coup d’grace against the Democratic leadership and its Zionist state sponsors. He concluded his observation by sharing the below post from Majestic 12, a Q Anon affiliate: Majestic 12‏ @TS_SCI_MAJIC12 Oct 30 Majestic 12 Retweeted Israel in Atlanta Ending the Endless Wars is bad for Israel. #UnsealEpstein is bad for Israel. #DrainTheSwamp is bad for Israel. #Disclosure is bad for Israel. Why? Q. Apart from the Russians, who have very sophisticated S-400 target acquisition radars covering the entire region, who else is saying this is a fake raid that never happened? A. As you might imagine, because the Zionists control most mainstream media enterprises, and this fake raid serves both the Zionists and the warmongering neo-conservatives in the USA that want to keep ISIS alive, keep stealing Syrian oil, and continue to undermine Syrian sovereignty, almost no one else is challenging the narrative with two exceptions: the Daily Star in the UK has run two pieces, “Shock claim top ISIS leader is ‘Israeli spy’,” and “ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ‘not killed by US military’ Russia claims, and citizen journalists everywhere are pointing out the obvious flaws in the story. My favorite comes from a Nordic country, where an alert citizen quickly noticed that Google Earth, which updates on a monthly to yearly basis, not a daily basis, shows the alleged raid site as having been destroyed in the past, not recently. In addition, Newsweek has run with a story, “Obama White House Photographer Suggests Trump Situation Room Photo of Unfolding al-Baghdadi Raid Was Staged,” a story I agree with. I have no doubt that the Americans carried out a real raid with live ammunition and real dead. Everything else about this appears to have been faked, a terrible embarrassment to our President, unless of course, this is a deliberately fake event that he has authorized in detail. Q. You have been a Marine Corps infantry officer; a clandestine operations officer or spy; the senior civilian responsible for creating a new national intelligence analysis center; and a J-2 intelligence analyst in Afghanistan. What other “indicators” do you personally see that suggest this story is completely false? A. I personally continue to believe that President Donald Trump has been lied to, and is not a party to the total deception that has been imposed on him by a combination of Zionists and neoconservatives including members of his own staff who failed to defend him – in my view this terrible situation demonstrates that his new National Security Advisor – a very talented and nice person – is not up to the task of protecting the President from being lied to by the military-intelligence complex that is still in a state of treason, selected officials not-withstanding. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency as well as the Secretary of State have all failed the President by going along with a false narrative that they probably knew was false but allowed to go forward because of some combination of political opportunism, Zionist bribery and blackmail, and the President’s own ego – he fell into this one, made it his own, and in so doing has disgraced himself in the eyes of Xi and Putin. I see two levels of indicators that persuade me that this story is completely false. At the strategic level, this strikes me as a blatant attempt by the Zionists and their CIA collaborators who hate President Trump to keep the Kurds whom they are arming and training and leading, in the game. The Daily Beast published “The Kurds Spotted Baghdadi. The U.S. Abandoned Them Anyway” early on, and then I saw “Baghdadi’s death underscores what we’ve lost by abandoning Syria’s Kurds,” from The Washington Post, and a series of CIA-sponsored stories about how the Kurds continued to provide leads “even after Trump abandoned them” – below is from The Economic Times of India, “CIA got initial tip-off from one of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s wives and a courier: Report,” American officials told the newspaper that the Kurds continued to provide information to the CIA on Baghdadi’s location even after President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the American troops left the Syrian Kurds to confront a Turkish offensive alone. The Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, one official said, provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country. All this suggests that in combination, the Zionists and their treasonous allies in the US Departments of State and Defense and the CIA, are all seeking to block the President from fulfilling his campaign promise to get our forces out of the Middle East, and attempting to keep the Kurdish rebellion against the lawful Syrian government alive. Given that al-Baghdadi has been reported dead seven times, I have to ask myself, is it possible that CIA and DoD and State did not know this? Or that their Middle East action officers are all Zionists, many dual US-Israeli citizens, and some being bribed and blackmailed directly by the Zionists? From where I sit, the President has fallen victim to a grand deception and he has no one – least of all the treasonous FBI – that he can rely on to protect him from traitors within our own ranks. At the tactical level there are too many false notes across the entire story, to include dogs, an alleged tunnel with no exit, a site that has clearly been destroyed in the past, instantaneous DNA testing with the samples provided by the Kurds who are controlled by the Zionists, and more. The similarities with the false final Bin Laden raid that led to many US deaths after the fact as part of the cover-up, are startling to include – I am not making this up – throwing the alleged target’s body parts into the ocean. I keep waiting for CIA to release a photo of al-Baghdadi’s library before the alleged hide-out was allegedly flattened, it would not surprise me at all to learn that the long-dead al-Baghdadi was allegedly reading Orange Man, the new book by America’s greatest conservative cartoonist. Pablo Escobar’s article, “Caliph closure: ‘He died like a dog’, provides the best over-all appreciation of the total context and the likely fraud perpetuated within that context. This entire story cannot be understood without accepting the very high probability that this was a reverse false flag – a fake target created for political theater, with the President of the United States of America being made a fool of by a combination of traitors in Israel and the USA, and well-intentioned loyalists who simply do not know what they do not know about the ability of the Zionists and their Kurdish servants to lie to great effect. We did not kill al-Baghdadi, we certainly killed someone else, probably Abu Mohammad Salama or one of his deputies – none of them ISIS leaders, but rather leaders of Haras al-Din, an al Qaida affiliate. Q. What anomalies have you not mentioned, that have emerged since you were first invited to comment on this very strange Presidential declaration of triumph over what appears to be a fake person? Apart from Pablo Escobar’s piece, the single best commentary I have seen is from James Corbett, whose video, Something Big Has Happened! points out both the similarities with the fake raid to kill the fake final Bin Laden, with the many claimed deaths of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was deliberately turned into a fake threat by US propaganda. Four things jump out from various alternative media reports – the US and European media continue to lie about this raid and parrot the official narrative: 01 The alleged location of the raid in Idlib, which is not friendly ground for the alleged target, has been pointed out by many as incongruous. Privately my military colleagues are saying that the raid was launched either from the sea or from Israel, and Idlib was picked for the fake raid precisely because it was near the sea. 02 The frantic effort to “authenticate” what are probably lies about instant DNA analysis (DNA tests take between 24 and 72 hours although some capabilities may exist that can do a preliminary test in hours) suggest that the Pentagon is now very uneasy with the entire narrative including the President’s comments on whimpering. Never mind that the US has no idea if the original DNA was genuine, it could easily have been pre-matched to the intended patsy destined for future duty as a “Lee Harvey Oswald.” 02 The injured dog – when no one else was injured in a tunnel with no exit where the blast of a suicide vest would certainly have killed the dog and soldiers would also have been wounded if not killed by the blast that could only go in one direction appears to be pure theater. The classification of the dog’s photo and name as Top Secret takes this to new heights of ludicrousness. I have published a counterpart account, with photos, of the CIA’s Top Secret stealth cat in the spirit of engagement with the official narrative. 03 The underpants allegedly stolen by Kurds from deep within territory hostile to them – has generated a lovely thread on “false flag underpants” – are so unbelievable I have to question the sanity and professionalism of everyone who allowed this narrative to go forward. In combination with everything else, this strikes me as truly depraved Mossad humor, giving the Americans a pair of used underpants – probably including sperm – as a form of screwing with the goyim shiksas – the Zionist term for non-Jewish girls who can be treated as whores. 04 The alleged burial at sea of body parts – a suicide vest leaves the lower body – is so reminiscent of the ocean burial of the last Bin Laden that it suggests that those behind this narrative are absolutely certain we are all stupid. 05 This is all about oil and keeping ISIS alive as a joint Mossad-CIA operation. I am quite sure at this point that President Trump knows he has been manipulated into making a fool of himself, and I speculate that he is privately talking to President Putin about how to continue his plans to totally withdraw US forces from the region. I am reminded of the private conversations of John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, where they both agreed that their own worst enemies were their own generals who wanted war, not one another. Today I do not believe the Russian generals want war, but too many of the American generals are posturing pimps for war because that is how they earn their retirement jobs – they are also lying to the Secretary of Defense and the President about our readiness for war – not only are we not ready for sustained war away from the USA, but we will absolutely lose any war that includes Russia or China as a committed adversary. It is my hope that the President will realize that he has been treated with such scorn by Israel and the Kurds and that this gives him the strength to fire all those who were complicit in these lies, withdraw entirely from Syria, and rebuild our military here at home. 06 I have just read “Seven takeaways from the CENTCOM commander’s hot wash of the Baghdadi raid,” and I have to say that I simply do not believe that six men “suited up” in suicide vests when a supposedly surprise “breach” took place. While I have no direct experience my training and broad experience suggest that the action is over in 30 seconds. I also do not believe that the alleged al-Baghdadi dragged children into a “hole” with him. 07 ISIS confirming the death and naming a new leader is for me consistent with ISIS being a fake terrorist organization responsive to US direction – if President Trump wants a fake death confirmed and a new leader named, it is his to command. This raid may indeed serve the President well, but the anomalies are troubling. Q. This apparently falsified “triumph” against ISIS – and in favor of the Kurds and the US keeping military troops and even tanks on top of the Syrian oil fields – comes just as Trump appears ready to criminally indict Obama, Clapper, Comey, Brennan, McCabe, Strzok, and Page, among others. How do you assess Trump’s prospects for the next months? A. This falsified event will play well across America, and commentaries like mine and those of Gordon Duff and Pablo Escobar and James Corbett will not be noticed. For all practical purposes, this event is a political triumph, never mind that it is rooted in lies. The Chinese know this is a fake attack, the Russians know this is a fake attack, by now Trump knows this is a fake attack. There are now media reports that Trump has ordered the release of the video of the alleged attack, when it comes I expect it will be picked apart the way the video from the Christ Church false flag in New Zealand was picked apart. On a positive note, my colleague Ben Fulford, a long-time observer of high finance and low crime based on Tokyo, has published “Third (fourth?) death of Mossad agent Shimon Elliot “al-Baghdadi” actually signifies major Middle East change,” and strikes a very upbeat note that I am prepared to embrace. The view of his Pentagon sources is that this event is going to lead to increased US-Russian collaboration in cutting off illegal oil, arms, human, and drug trafficking in the Middle East that all benefit the Zionists and the Deep State. I must emphasis that there are seven or more US military and intelligence leadership networks, some purely evil, some committed to the President’s success. All those networks are at war with one another. I believe the President and the White Hats will triumph in time. If the President wants to make lemonade with these lemons, he should declare victory against ISIS and leave Syria. His occupation of Syrian oil fields is both unconstitutional within the USA and illegal in relation to international treaties and conventions. You mention the criminal indictments. I published “SPECIAL: Game-Changing Court Filing by Michael Flynn Defense Lawyer Sidney Powell…PLUS DoJ Criminal Inquiry Plus Seth Rich Murder Central Brennan Task Force Plus Stone & Manafort to Get Off?” a few days ago and it has gone viral in part because Sidney Powell, the attorney for my colleague General Michael Flynn, has filed a detailed federal court document that itemizes the many crimes committed by all those seeking to fabricate the narrative of Russian election interference and Donald Trump as a Russian asset. The murder of Seth Rich is now part of the conspiracy led by President Barack Obama, and complicity in murder is on the table for all those who committed treason in mis-directing secret intelligence against then candidate Donald Trump. I will end on a most positive note: while I would like to see our President do more to defend the US Constitution (especially the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendments), to bring all our troops home from all over the world; and to address the huge problems facing the working class and people of faith in the USA, on balance I believe that in the next few months the world will see political, legal, economic, and cultural triumphs by our President that could not have been imagined since the days of John F. Kennedy. Unlike JFK, our President cannot be assassinated. He will triumph. It is my hope that Iran will understand that behind the political theater and completely apart from our President’s continued tolerance of traitors in key positions, there is a house cleaning going on. From election reform to military tribunals to a global currency reset and a national debt jubilee to the reinstatement of family values and civic virtue, “Orange Man” is on a path pre-ordained by God, who absolutely has a sense of humor. Q. Do you have an opinion on how the impeachment campaign will end, and who the Democrats will nominate to run against President Trump if you are certain he will run? Are there any “wild cards.” A. The impeachment campaign will not end well for the Democrats. It is only in the news because the Deep State wants it to be in the news and is manipulating the polls. In the Heartland, everyone agrees that this is a “lynching” and those giving false testimony against our President are committing treason. It merits comment that so many Republicans are retiring precisely because they see the future: the public is going to turn against both of political parties that have betrayed the public trust and fronted for the Deep State. If President Trump implements #UNRIG (the election reform act championed by Dr. Cynthia McKinney and myself that the Zionists worked so hard to destroy), not only will he win with a landslide, but he could carry a whole new congress with him. Certainly by 2022 I expect four to five vibrant parties with blocks of elected representatives in Congress and at the state and local level. There are riots all over the world – the public is fed up with corruption and demanding new honest governments. Once the FISA criminal indictments are processed, in time for the beginning of the presidential campaign that does not really start until 1 February 2020, I believe the President will be assured of winning, and if he creates the truth channel and/or uses legal measures to force the media and social media to stop violating the 1st Amendment and Title 7 (anti-discrimination), the outcome will be clear by 4 July 2020. The Democrats not only know they cannot win with anyone now running, but they have been quoted as saying that they collect more money in donations if President Trump is re-elected. I believe the Democrats are preparing to “throw” the Presidential election while seeking to take back the Senate. Tulsi Gabbard is the wild card. This young person was a Congressional staffer who appears to have joined the military with clear political intent. She started as a military police enlisted person and then became a medical specialist – a form of nurse administrator. Not only is she not a combat veteran in the correct sense of the word, but she is also in direct violation of all US military regulations against the use of her appearing in uniform as part of her political campaign. She has been keeping these two facts secret. Now here is what most do not know: not only is she Hindu, but she is also a Brahmin, the India version of 1%. There is no difference between Hillary Clinton’s calling all of us “deplorables,” and Tulsi Gabbard viewing all of us as “untouchables” – as an avowed Hindu she must believe that caste division should be the law. All indications are that the Deep State is thinking hard about a possible run by Bloomberg – a Zionist at heart – and Gabbard, a cosmetic bimbo whose shallowness may not survive a Presidential campaign. However, if President Trump continues to ignore Independents, Libertarians, blacks, Latinos, suburban woman, the young, and the elderly on the West and East coasts, then Bloomberg-Gabbard is a winning ticket and – if they win – the US Constitution will be discarded with the end of free speech, the confiscation of guns, and a police state where local mass surveillance is the norm. I do not think Hillary Clinton will run as much as she may delude herself into thinking she could win. Apart from the high probability of her being indicted soon, even if this is done secretly to avoid a public battle with the left, for high crimes including hundreds of millions of dollars taken in bribes from the French for Libya, from the Saudis for Syria and Yemen, and from the Russians for Uranium One, she is deeply vulnerable on the pedophilia front, and the election machines are being secured at the same time that all illegal aliens are being stripped from the voting rolls – three million illegal aliens voted for her in 2016, that is not going to happen again. America is in the middle of a civil war between those who favor pedophilia, bestiality, transgenderism, and transhumanism, and those who favor faith, family, and community. The conservatives are losing that war because of the Zionists – our worst enemy – control entertainment, the media, and the communications and computing networks that they use for espionage and insider trading. I am not certain the President is fully familiar with the depth and breadth of the Zionist threat within the USA, one reason I value the opportunity to publish in Tehran Times. He and his family have received briefings from me that bring together distinguished authors – my Memoranda for the President: 9/11 Truth is the stake in the heart of Zionism in the USA along with my memo on the Epstein case, the “Nine Veils of Evil,” and my collected Tehran Times articles, many censored in the USA, that I published as TRUMP vs. THE DEEP STATE: Recent Reflections of a Former US Spy & Marine Corps Officer. At Thanksgiving the President and his intimates will soon be receiving a copy of my new book, EYES ONLY: For the President (and the Public): Everything the Deep State Does Not Want You To Know. Iran is correct is insist on the end of Israel – an invented state rooted in lies, bribes, blackmail and genocide – and the restoration of Palestine to the Palestinians. Similarly here in the USA, we must insist on the death of the Deep State and its Zionist underbelly so as to restore integrity to our Constitutional Republic. I will pray for the day that our President meets the Supreme Leader, in Tehran, to “make the deal.” Be assured of the coincidence of interest between patriotic American conservatives, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. We will win this fight, using ethical, legal, non-violent means, Insha’Allah. It helps us here in the USA if Iran and the Palestinians triumph in the Middle East – and vice versa. Iran and the USA have a common enemy: the Zionist state of Israel. Source: Abu Mohammad Salama Killed? Did Zionists & Kurds Deceive President Trump?

    "articleText": "On Thursday Boris finally got the election he wanted. On Friday he blew his chances of winning a majority by ruling out a deal with that nice man Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. The result is that the Brexit Party will stand candidates in the overwhelming majority of seats, potentially costing the Tories victory in around 90 marginal constituencies. The first December election since 1923 is likely to result in another hung Parliament. The difference between the two parties of course is Boris’s disastrous deal. Unlike Boris, the Brexit Party are serious Brexiteers. Quite sensibly they regard Boris’s deal as BRINO – Brexit In Name Only. Once Boris ignored my advice, back-channeled to Downing St. and repeated in this column, to advise HM the Queen to refuse Royal Assent to the notorious Benn Bill, he had to deal with the Brexit Party. That’s because he was never going to get a deal approved before Halloween. In turn that meant a General Election, which the Tories were never going to win without a deal with Nigel’s boys. Frankly, it never occurred to me until earlier this week that Boris would stick his deal into the Tory manifesto. I know Boris isn’t the sharpest knife in the box, no offense intended. He’s a politician, after all, and it’s an iron rule of politics that electorates will only vote for people who are marginally smarter than they are. (The accepted IQ ceiling is 125, which means that most democracies are led by comparatively dumb people.) To every rule there is an exception, however. President Trump is a lot smarter than he looks, no offense intended. In a phone-in with Nigel Farage after the election was called he suggested a Tory-Brexit Party deal. It had already been ruled out however. Boris’s plan is insane, frankly. It could easily cost him those 90 seats, in other words a majority. This is a difficult election to call, given the probable amount of tactical voting, but I can’t see any way in which Boris can now win. The good news is that the anti-Brexit vote is also split, four ways in fact, between Labour, the LibDems, the various German-sponsored nationalist parties and the eco-fanatic Greens, who are so dumb they not only believe in the EU they believe in global warming as well! Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable (mind you, so was Theresa May!). I can’t see him winning a majority. The big uncertainty is how many seats the Brexit Party will win. If they’re sensible – and they have a sensible leader and no National Executive Committee – they will target Leave voting Labour-held seats in South Wales, the Midlands and the North. The Tory manifesto is likely to be pretty dull. It’s unlikely to contain anything of serious interest to conservatives. The Johnson government has already caved in to the Cabinet Office over fracking and will probably do so over the abolition of death duties and the 80 mph motorway speed limit. Boris’s reaction to Nigel Farage’s offer was frankly discourteous and pretty dismissive. Even more worryingly, it wasn’t terribly rational. He’s complaining that a deal might split the Brexit vote and let Jeremy Corbyn through, but that’s precisely what a deal would be designed to avoid. Given the corruption of the EU, its history of buying up leaders to do deals and the suddenness of Boris’s deal, it is legitimate to ask whether or not any improper financial arrangements were made. I am not saying that they were, merely that in the interests of transparency there ought to be an assurance that everything is in order. The DVD have a huge slush fund, which used to be, and I think still is, is in the name of a Swiss-registered company, S, with its main account in Geneva. Typically in advance of an EU treaty we see large transfers from that account to a master distribution account. As I say, predicting this election is not easy, but you are entitled to my view. My prediction is that the Tories will be the largest party, but that Boris has now thrown away his chance of winning a majority. I can’t see left-wing loony Corybn winning. I also predict that the Brexit Party and the DUP will hold the balance of power, dooming Boris’s deal and increasing the chances of a clean break from the EU on January 31st. Boris is the third Tory Prime Minister in a row to have his premiership wrecked by the Cabinet Office and Europe. Boris is a good campaigner, but now that’s he house-trained he’s hampered by weak policies, that is to say policies acceptable to the Cabinet Office, who will effectively be drafting the Tory manifesto. There’s no way that the Tories will allow him to fight another General Election. With this one thrown away their thoughts will already be turning to Boris’s successor, who may well be that nice man Jacob Rees-Mogg. Boris is now damaged goods. LibDem Stupidity LibDem MEP Chris Davies is in the running for the silliest tweet of the week award. The silly tweeter, no offense intended, objected to Brexiteers wearing the poppy, on the basis that the EU was set up to preserve the peace in Europe (!). As I have pointed out on these pages before the concept of the European Economic Community was dreamt up by the Reich Ministry of Economic Affairs between 1939 and 1941 as a means of ensuring German domination of the continent and the UK after German occupying forces withdrew. It was all to do with German control and nothing whatsoever to do with preserving the peace. In any event peace was preserved in western Europe by NATO, not the EU, which even now lacks a significant military capability. NATO’s success was due in no small part to American and Canadian commitment, which the French in particular sought to frustrate. Chris Davies is also historically illiterate, with respect. Peace was only preserved in western Europe. The process of creating the euro led directly to a series of brutal wars in the Balkans. The EU has brought war and ethnic cleansing, not peace. Labour stupidity This election is turning out to be a battle of the stupids. Labour’s economic projections are based on the crackpot theory that increasing tax rates increases the tax take. This ignores both economic reality and the Laffer Curve. Tax increases have a negative effect on GDP, whilst tax decreases have a positive effect. To increase tax receipts you need to decrease taxes. Obviously if you decrease the rate to zero you get no tax income at all, but the same applies if you increase the rate to 100%. The British people have a folk memory of the massive tax hikes imposed when German agent Harold Wilson was Prime Minister. The top tax rate, on investment income, was over 90%. Whilst Wilson, backed by the Cabinet Office, achieved his aim of inflicting short-term damage on the British economy it was at the expense of inflicting long-term damage on the credibility of his party. The Ukraine nonsense I think we now know the name of the ‘whistleblower’ – the CIA’s Eric Ciaramella. His connection to John Brennan immediately undermines his credibility. The CIA, and Brennan’s boys in particular, have been waging war on the Trump Administration since the election. It can hardly be a coincidence that the CIA and Adam ‘von’ Schiff came up with this nonsense as Attorney-General William Barr and his team closed in on ‘von’ Mueller’s Russia hoax in their criminal investigation. The cast of characters in the Ukrainian conspiracy includes a half-crazed, half-bird, dual national colonel of Ukrainian birth, who was worried about the Administration’s change of policy towards Kiev. Since the Ukraine is a German client state and was involved in the murderous attack on Flight MH17 the policy change was more than justified. As I said last week this is dangerous territory for the Democrats. Although the Obama Administration, which was comfortable with the mass murder by the Chinese and the Ukrainians of innocent civilians flying in Ukrainian airspace, successfully blamed Russia for MH17, that outrageous and offensive lie could well be exposed in the run up to November 2020. Photo From Stars & Stripes Conan The good news is that Conan’s wounds are not life-threatening. Sounds like the valiant pooch is going to make a full recovery! I’m sure he’s had some extra dog biscuits, but I still think he should get the Dickin Medal. I know that some valued colleagues here on VT are saying that the al-Baghdadi raid was a stunt and that the nasty old terrorist did not fall off his perch. Others are querying President Trump’s account of the raid. Since the bin Laden raid was staged, in the sense that the bin Laden who was whacked was not the bin Laden but a son, I can see where they’re coming from. The problem with the “al-Baghdadi is still alive” argument however is no al-Baghdadi. If he really were still alive I would have expected him to be produced by now, or at least a video. There hasn’t even been a tweet. No, he’s dead alright. The MSM are complaining that the feed into Situation Room was only an overhead feed. Correct, but there was gap of around 16 hours before the President’s historic broadcast. Do the MSM really think that the President of the United States’ sources on a major counter-terrorist operation are limited to an overhead feed from a circling drone? Of course they aren’t. I have no problems with the President’s description of al-Baghdadi’s last moments. Terrorists are cowards, who wage war mostly on unarmed civilians. I would expect them to cry and whimper when confronted with real soldiers. Inhalers and global warming A report this week complaining about the contribution asthma inhalers make to the Greenhouse Effect is in competition with a report saying that fracking causes earthquakes for the Silliest Report of the Week Award. Why asthmatics should be forced to give up their inhalers, or switch to the powdered variety, which I suspect is less efficient, in order to combat global warming is a bit of a mystery to me. Yes inhalers put out minute quantities of CO2, but so what? Humanity’s contribution to global CO2 output is pretty minute anyway, only about one thirtieth. This is a classic example of Goebbels’ Big Lie technique. Researchers pushing the man-made global warming hypothesis rarely mention non-human CO2 emissions at all. Since only about 3.3% of CO2 emissions are human how can they affect the climate? The other uncomfortable truth global warming nutters suppress is that CO2 is only a minor greenhouse gas, responsible for about 5% of the Greenhouse Effect. Global warming is for hysterical autistic teenagers. No responsible adult should be propagating this nonsense. My reading this week This has included F-4 Phantom by the late Tim McLelland (Ian Allan, 2013), a fine aviation author. This is an excellent book, marred only by some mistakes with the illustrations, confusing J-79-powered Phantoms with Spey-Phantoms, for example. Still it’s one of the best books ever written about this fine aircraft. There are some fascinating insights into the Phantom’s selection by the USAF. (I never knew that the F-110, as the Air Force version was originally designated, was officially named the Specter – did you?) I also didn’t know that McDonnell started work on the British naval Phantom as early as 1963, having correctly calculated that our smaller decks required a higher angle of attack, achieved by extending the nose-wheel. McLelland worked for the Guardian and wrote from a left-wing perspective. He was wrong with respect about the TSR-2 and the cancellation of CVA-01 and CVA-02, but there’s no doubting his aviation literacy. He also fell for North Vietnamese propaganda about their pilots like Le Hai achieving lots of kills with their inferior Migs. They were mostly flown by West German pilots, one of the untold stories about the Vietnam War. However McLelland was generous in his praise for the fine work done in the mighty Phantom over ‘Nam by US Navy, USMC and USAF crews. The work of the USMC fighter attack squadrons is often overlooked, unfairly. There is no doubt that the Phantom would have achieved many more kills in ‘Nam but for the spurious directive from the German spy Robert McNamara requiring visual contact with the target before engaging, as though a radar contact over North Vietnam might be a United DC-8 off course. This ‘tactic’ negated the advantage conferred by the Phantom’s fine radar and sophisticated Beyond Visual Range AIM-7 Sparrow air to air missiles. Keen to help the North Vietnamese win the war, ‘Mac’ also stopped you guys from hitting NVPAF airfields like Yen Bai. The FBI’s failure to arrest, try and fry McNamara (I appreciate that the FBI don’t do the actual frying) was one of the most egregious counter-intelligence failures in history. The DVD rang rings around the Fibbies in the Vietnam War, sadly. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "title": "Do Democrats own the word “Lynching”?",
    "description": "And did President Trump, who labeled his impeachment inquiry “a lynching?\" properly use the term or did he violate another social norm?",
    "articleText": "EDITORIAL NOTE AND COUNTERPOINT: Today’s Democratic Party is NOT the historical party of the 1800s and very early 20th Century the author references in this article. Same with today’s Republican Party. The parties switched places in the 1950s vis-a-vie the Southern Strategy deployed by Republicans. The Southern Strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. As the civil rights movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party. It also helped to push the Republican Party much more to the right while the Democratic Party became the party of civil rights. And this is how we got here in 2019 with the Republican Party and Trump now using the word “lynching” in their political rhetoric. Importantly, while the article below has historical factual correctness, it does NOT inform readers of the change in party values over time giving the impression that today’s Democratic Party has the same values of its historical yesteryear party thus possibly giving the reader the impression that those values exist today. They do not! Nevertheless, VT allows the author’s article to be published in the spirit of a free press. We do NOT censor our authors. We want readers to be knowledgable so they can make hay of it themselves for we believe in a free and open press with an informed educated electorate. Signed, John Allen, GM, VT Democrats own the Word “Lynching”! by Ed Mattson Every Lefty had a complete hissy fit over President Trump referring to the bogus, one-sided Democrat, closed-door, star chamber hearing that is being carried out in the secure basement SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) as a LYNCHING. One would have thought the sky was falling. When it comes to hypocrisy, the Left has no equal. Imagine leftist-loonies being upset at the president using the word lynching. It is a word that the Democrats own, lock, stock, and barrel, paid for by the blood of the African-Americans the Ku Klux Klan members extracted beginning in 1863, following the Emancipation Proclamation. Even with the deaths of more than 600,000 soldiers who perished in the Civil War to eliminate slavery and insure equal rights to all, the Democrat Party army, the KKK, would simply not accept the fact that the South and its slavery policies were defeated on the field of battle. Like all cowards, the use of intimidation by The Klan of not only Blacks but also white sympathizers took the lives of thousands who were left hanging from trees and poles for exercising their God-given right to freedom of speech. Perhaps this is why the Democrats and their Media cohorts are so upset by Trump’s use of the word lynching . . . because they believe they OWN that word and have been damn proud of it until the mid1960’s when many African –Americans began to see how the Democrats had mysteriously convinced Black America that the Democrats cared about them. It was the Republicans who fought for equal rights throughout the Sixties, died by the thousands during the Civil War, and condemned the likes of racist Democrats like Alabama Governor George Wallace, Senator Robert, KKK, Byrd (D-WV), an outspoken segregationist Sen. William Fulbright (D-AR), that today should be looked at as the “real friends of the African-American community”. But that isn’t what is happening in our public education “internment camp” schools where today our children are being taught just the opposite . . . that the Democrat Party has always looked out for the Black community. This, of course, has been supported by our crooked media which have been lying about “Trump Russian Collusion” starting just 19 minutes after he was sworn in as President. Their track record regarding the truth about President Trump’s accomplishment in just three short years is as disappointing as any editorial comment one might read in Izvestia or Pravda (Russian state-owned propaganda newspapers). The media should be reporting the truth about the Democrat Party reminding the public that it was these same segregationists who blockaded the entrance to white schools in the South forbidding Black children from entering during the turbulent Sixties; that it was the Democrats who unleashed the attack dogs on Black protestors, used high pressure water hoses on protest marchers, and even supported the lawless Ku Klux Klan and their rampage of Black lynchings, cross burnings, intimidation, rigged elections, and even murder. But to those on the left, the truth doesn’t matter. It’s their agenda that counts, the rest of the country be damned. A little history lesson is in order about now. The first known account of execution by using a rope in what was called a hanging was in Homer’s Odyssey (Book XXII): ‘Telemachus and I will keep the noble Suitors in the hall,’ resourceful Odysseus replied, ‘however fiercely they fight, while you two tie Melanthius’ arms and legs behind his back, and throw him into the storeroom, then strap him to a board, fasten him to a coil of rope and hoist him up by a roof-beam to the top of a tall pillar, and let him hang there a while in torment.’ From that point history evolves using the rope as a means of carrying out capital punishment, and in January 1692, such punishment moved to The New World of America when a group of young girls in Salem Village, Massachusetts, became consumed by disturbing “fits” accompanied by seizures, violent contortions and bloodcurdling screams. A doctor diagnosed the children as being victims of black magic, and over the next several months, allegations of witchcraft spread like a virus through the small Puritan settlement. Twenty people were eventually executed as witches, but contrary to popular belief, none of the condemned was burned at the stake. In accordance with English law, 19 of the victims of the Salem Witch Trials were instead taken to the infamous Gallows Hill to die by hanging. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., in countries on the continent of Europe the traditional method of death by rope involved “suspending the victim from a gallows or crossbeam until he or she has died of asphyxiation. Elsewhere, the condemned person stands on a trapdoor, and when the trap is released he or she falls several feet until stopped by the rope tied around his neck. The jerk breaks the cervical vertebrae and is thought to cause immediate loss of consciousness. A knot or metal eyelet (the hangman’s knot) in the noose helps jerk back the victim’s head sharply enough to break the neck”. Yes, there has been a long history of hanging. Hanging was one of the modes of execution under ancient Roman law, and adopted by Anglo-Saxons from their German ancestors. Public hangings became the prescribed method of punishment in the form of public execution for homicides in England by the 12th century and eventually came to surpass all other forms of capital punishment for felony convictions until England discontinued public executions in 1868. Hangings were then removed from public view and conducted in the prisons. In 1965 capital punishment was discontinued in Great Britain altogether. Following the end of WWII, Japanese and German war criminals were sentenced to die by hanging It wasn’t just we “blood-thirsty English speaking people” bent on revenge who used the hangman’s rope to dole out justice. The popularity of hanging became the standard mode of execution throughout the British Empire and wherever else the Anglo-American common law was adopted. But it was also widely used in Russia, Austria, Hungary, and Japan. Hanging was also the preeminent means of execution in the United States until the mid-20th century. As sophisticated as we American pretend to be, today we find the politically correct crowd cannot even use the verb to hang; God forbid we even think about using the vernacular of hanging by uttering the word lynching . . . so sinful, only to be used by Democrats! So what’s the difference between hanging and lynching? A lynching is an unlawful murder by an angry mob of people. Throughout history, dominant groups have used lynchings as a way of controlling minorities. This is probably more easily recognized by those of us who have been around for several decades, with lynching being widely carried out to punish outlaws (cattle rustling, bank robbery, and horse thieves) made famous in the western movie genre of the white hat vs. black hat cowboys. The old cliché “Get a rope and find a tree” was commonly heard on the old western frontier, when it was just too much bother to allow a criminal his legal rights to a trial and judgement by his peers. When people took the law into their own hands and decided to punish a suspected criminal — or merely a person who just needed to be dead. In short, a lynching is an unlawful murder by an angry mob of people. Throughout history, dominant groups have used lynchings as a way of controlling minorities. The difference between hanging and lynching can probably be better explained by understanding the difference between a democracy and a republic. Amazingly Democrats love to talk about how they believe in democracy . . . majority rule. That’s not what we have in the United States. We have a REPUBLIC, which protects the rights of minorities, which is why Democrats traditionally try to circumvent our U.S. Constitution and ignore the guaranties in the Bill of Rights (particularly the first, second, fourth and fifth amendments). They only want to discuss the Constitution when they have something to gain from it. Other than that, the Democrats would just as well do without those “stupid protections afforded to the citizens”. Under their idea, democracy would allow majority rule. That’s what they are always clamoring for. That would mean if they took a vote and 51% of the vote count wanted to do away with people with handicaps, or left-hand people, they would simply line ‘em up and march them off to the guillotine and do away with them. There would be no representation of minority rights. That’s the way it works in a democracy. Okay for them but no so okay if you find yourself in a minority situation. You could become history in very short order! Modern-day lynchings became evident to most Americans in the decades following the Emancipation Proclamation especially during the period of racially motivated hate rampages of the Ku Klux Klan which was the outlaw army and enforcers of the Democrat Party in the American South. The word lynching and its related verb, lynch, come from Captain William Lynch, who took control of imposing and policing order in Virginia during the Revolutionary War. So the KKK thought it was very apropos to adopt lynchings as a way to enforce their reign of terror over Blacks and their white sympathizers. What our country is witnessing since Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, has been a concerted effort by the Democrats and their co-conspirators, the mainstream media, is an unlawful and seditious act to overthrow the U.S. government. President Trump rightly labeled this whole spectacle as “A LYNCHING”. These fools have even acknowledged they cannot defeat President Trump at the ballot box, so their only alternative is to frame him for crimes and use impeachment to get rid of him. With the Democrats holding a majority in the House of Representatives we now have a classic example of mob-rule mentality. For three years they have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars. They have used lies, foreign influence, bribery, extortion, threats, tampering with evidence, coercion, and witness intimidation to build a case of wrongdoing that would warrant impeachment. To any real American with a pair of eyes, this whole affair is a fraud. To continue with this charade and squandering any more time by our so-called legislators who have already wasted three year’s salaries sitting on their asses watching the sham play out, should be enough reason to arrest them all and try them on grounds of sedition.

    "description": "I Saw Lincoln Shot: The only living witness re-creates the drama of that tragic night. Reprint from The American Weekly article published on Feb. 7, 1954",
    "articleText": "I SAW LINCOLN SHOT The only living witness re-creates the drama of that tragic night As told to Frances Spatz Leighton in 1954 This is an eyewitness account of one of history’s great tragedies – the assassination of Abraham Lincoln – told by the only living witness to the fateful drama enacted at Ford’s Theater on the night of April 14, 1865 – The Editors by Samuel J. Seymour, The American Weekly, Feb. 7, 1954 Even if I were to live another 94 years, I’d still never forget my first trip away from home as a little shaver five years old. My father was overseer on the Goldsboro estate in Talbot County, Maryland and it seems that he and Mr. Goldsboro had to go to Washington on business – something to do with the legal status of their 150 slaves. Mrs. Goldsboro asked if she couldn’t take me and my nurse, Sarah Cook, along with her and the men, for a little holiday. We made the 150-mile trip by coach and team and I remember how stubborn those horses were about being loaded onto an old-fashioned side-wheeler steamboat for part of the journey. Samuel J. Seymour was only five years old when President Lincoln was assassinated. It was going on toward supper time – on Good Friday, April 14, 1865 – when we finally pulled up in front of the biggest house I ever seen. It looked to me like a thousand farmhouse all pushed together, but my father said it was a hotel. I was scared. I had seen men with guns, all along the street, and every gun seemed to be aimed right at me. I was too little to realize that all Washington was getting ready to celebrate because Lee had surrendered a few days earlier. I complained tearfully that I couldn’t get out of the coach because my shirt was torn – anything to delay the dread moment – but Sarah dug into her bag and found a big safety pin. “You hold still now, Sammy” she said, “And I’ll fix the tear right away.” I shook so hard, from fright, that she accidentally stabbed me with the pin and I hollered, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” When I finally had been rushed upstairs, shushed and scrubbed and put into fresh clothes, Mrs. Goldsboro said she had a wonderful surprise. “Sammy, you and Sarah and I are going to a play tonight,” she explained. “A real play – and President Abraham Lincoln will be there.” I thought a play would be a game like tag and I liked the idea. We waited a while outside the Ford Theater for tickets, then walked upstairs and sat in hard rattan-backed chairs. Mrs. Goldsboro pointed directly across the theater to a colorfully draped box. “See those flags, Sammy?” she asked. “That’s where President Lincoln will sit.”. When he finally did come in, she lifted me up high so I could see. He was a tall, stern-looking man. I guess I just thought he looked stern because of his whiskers because he was smiling and waving to the crowd. When everyone sat down again and the actors started moving and talking, I began to get over the scared feeling I’d had ever since we arrived in Washington. But that was something I never should have done. All of a sudden a shot rang out – a shot that always will be remembered – and someone in the President’s box screamed. I saw Lincoln slumped forward in his seat. People started milling around and I thought there’d been another accident when one man seemed to tumble over the balcony rail and land on the stage. “Hurry, hurry, let’s go help the poor man who fell down,” I begged But by that time, John Wiles Booth, the assassin, had picked himself up and was running for dear life. he wasn’t caught until 12 days later when he was tracked to a barn where he was hiding. Only a few people noticed the running man, but pandemonium broke loose in the theater, with everyone shouting: “Lincolns’s shot! The Presidents’s dead!” Mrs. Goldsboro swept me into her arms and held me close and somehow we go outside the theater. That night I was shot 50 times, a least, in my dreams – and I sometimes still relive the horror of Lincoln’s assassination, dozing in my rocker as an old codger like me is bound to do. TV GAME SHOW: I’VE GOT A SECRET Mr. Samuel J. Seymour, the last living eyewitness to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. was the mystery guest on the February 8, 1956 episode of the I’ve Got a Secret game show. He passed just 2 months later. Mr. Seymour (March 28, 1860 – April 12, 1956) was actually 95 years of age at the time of this appearance instead of 96.

    "description": "Eye-opening new perspectives on Gettysburg’s overlooked cavalry battle",
    "articleText": "George Armstrong Custer is famous for his fatal defeat at the Little Bighorn in 1876, but Custer’s baptism of fire came during the Civil War. After graduating last in the West Point class of 1861, Custer served from the First Battle of Bull Run (only a month after graduation) through Appomattox, where he witnessed the surrender. But Custer’s true rise to prominence began at Gettysburg in 1863. On the eve of the Battle of Gettysburg, only twenty-three years old and barely two years removed from being the goat of his West Point class, Custer received promotion to brigadier general and command – his first direct field command – of the Michigan Cavalry Brigade, the “Wolverines.” “A thoughtful and challenging new look at the great assault at Gettysburg, from planning to aftermath. Not afraid to lay blame where he thinks it belongs, Tucker is fresh and bold in his analysis and use of sources. Even though any reader knows in advance the outcome, still Pickett’s Charge maintains suspense to the sound of the last gun.” —William C. Davis, author of Crucible of Command Now that he held general rank, Custer felt comfortable wearing the distinctive, some said gaudy, uniform that helped skyrocket him into fame and legend. However flashy he may have been in style, Custer did not disappoint his superiors, who promoted him in a search for more aggressive cavalry officers. At approximately noon on July 3, 1863, Custer and his men heard enemy cannon fire: Stuart’s signal to Lee that he was ready for action. Thus began the melee that was East Cavalry Field at Gettysburg. Much back and forth preceded Custer’s career-defining action. An hour or two into the battle, after many of his cavalrymen had been reduced to hand-to-hand infantry-style fighting, Custer ordered a charge of one of his regiments and led it into action himself, screaming one of the battle’s most famous lines: “Come on, you Wolverines!” Around three o’clock, Stuart mounted a final charge, which mowed down Union cavalry – until it ran into Custer’s Wolverines, who stood firm, with Custer wielding a sword at their head, and broke the Confederates’ last attack. In a book combining two popular subjects, Tucker recounts the story of Custer at Gettysburg with verve, shows how the Custer legend was born on the fields of the war’s most famous battle, and offers eye-opening new perspectives on Gettysburg’s overlooked cavalry battle.

    "articleText": "Patriots toppled the statue in July 1776, but British Loyalists rescued and hid some of the fragments (Courtesy of Skinner Auctioneers) You Could Own an Amputated Arm From the George III Statue Toppled at Bowling Green By Meilan Solly/Smithsonian.com Five days after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, around 40 soldiers and sailors snuck into a small Manhattan park called Bowling Green. Operating under the cover of darkness, these rebellious patriots draped ropes across the park’s centerpiece—a 4,000-pound equestrian statue of England’s reviled George III—and toppled it over. Then, they melted the monarch’s likeness down, using its remnants to cast 42,088 bullets. As postmaster Ebenezer Hazard wrote to General Horatio Gates in the days following the act, “[The king’s] statue here has been pulled down to make musket ball of, so that his troops will probably have melted Majesty fired at them.” The majority of the lead monument vanished in the forges, but a few fragments actually survived the incident: among others, the tail of the king’s metal horse, a piece of George III’s patterned sash, and a 20-pound segment believed to belong to the king’s cape or his horse’s mane. Now, Michelle Young reports for Untapped New York, one of these unlikely survivors—an amputated arm unearthed in 1991—is headed to auction. Advertised as a “lead hand, wrist and forearm likely from the statue of King George III,” the artifact will go under the hammer at Skinner Auctioneers’ November 1 Historic Arms & Militaria sale, where it is expected to sell for between $15,000 and $25,000.

If he’s the model of the American Presidency in the world we live in now, God help us. The Mythology that surrounds this guy is enough to make you puke. And don’t ever forget it.“",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis and Mark Dankof Mark Dankof is the former 36th District Chairman of the Republican Party in King County/Seattle. He was an elected delegate to Texas State Republican Conventions in 1994 and 1996 and entered the United States Senate race in Delaware in 2000 as the nominated candidate of the Constitution Party against Democratic candidate Thomas Carper and Republican incumbent William Roth. Dankof has been disturbing the Zionist party for many years through his podcast (The Ugly Truth) and political activism. Jonas E. Alexis: The Pearl Harbor debacle was indeed a catastrophic moment in American history. Numerous historians have written on this issue. Historians Thomas Fleming and Charles A. Beard have written fairly balanced accounts on Roosevelt’s duplicitous maneuvering and the event leading up to World War II.[1] Fleming documents that Roosevelt deliberately lied to the American people in order to get America into a bloody conflict with Japan. Fleming even points out that Harry Dexter White, a Soviet communist spy in the Roosevelt administration, had a negative influence on the Roosevelt administration. But that’s where Fleming stops. He doesn’t point out that White was indeed a Jewish communist who wanted to essentially destroy Japan during World War II. John Koster’s Operation Snow: How a Soviet Mole in FDR’s White House Triggered Pearl Harbor goes into great details about how White single-handedly pushed America into a bloody and unnecessary conflict with Japan.[2] M. Stanton Evans’ Stalin’s Secret Agents: The Subversion of Roosevelt’s Government also offers a riveting account of the widespread infiltration of the federal government by Soviet commies.[3] Robert Stinnett’s Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor provides another facet of this important issue.[4] Stinnett does not mention Harry Dexter White’s covert activity in the Roosevelt administration at all. I contacted him and asked him why the blatant omission. He responded by saying: “Day of Deceit concerns the United States Navy and its success in breaking the Imperial Japanese Naval military codes of Japan in 1941. My principal source is National Archives and Record Group 38, ‘The Crane Files’ at Archives II, College Park, Maryland, plus extensive interviews with the US Naval military code breakers including the Traffic Chief of Station ‘H’ located on Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. I am the only author of Pearl Harbor non-fiction books who conducted interviews with the USN military code breakers. “The momentous records of the Crane Files, plus my interviews with USN cryptos did not disclose any information on Mr. White or Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. I am aware of Mr. White and his association with the Civil War in China and Mr. Morgenthau as a member of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Cabinet. As far as I can determine, neither White or Morgenthau were cleared for the Military Top Secret information involving Japan and were not engaged in military cryptology.”[5] Stinnett’s point here is understandable. But perhaps that is one weak point in Day of Deceit. To me, Talking about the conflict between Japan and the United States during World War II without mentioning Harry Dexter White is like writing a lengthy book about World War II without mentioning Nazi Germany. In any event, unpack this multi-layered story for us, Mark Dankof. You were the one who encouraged me to read Operation Snow more than a year ago. Some historians like Samuel Eliot Morison did perpetuate the claim that the Pearl Harbor attack was a “surprise.”[6] Is that true? Unpack this sotry for us and tell us why FDR was a duplicitous man. Mark Dankof: The event which tells you more about who I am now involved one Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the infamous Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. I was not born until 1955, of course, but in the 1960s and 1970s, two different Air Force tours on Oahu with my father enabled me to develop an extreme interest in the subject. The event that involved my life with Roosevelt’s legacy, and the tragedy of December 7th, 1941, occurred in late 1971 or early 1972, during my sojourn in high school at Iolani School in downtown Honolulu, near the Ala Wai Canal, Diamond Head, and Waikiki Beach. There was a fantastic American history teacher at Iolani in those days, the late, salty retired American Navy Captain R. C. Sleight. He had been a destroyer skipper in World War II. His politics were Right of Center, but he had plenty of room in the class for anyone who disagreed with his views with their own academic and political perspective, if it was credible. His sardonic humor, Sea Captain’s expressions, and wit would be ruled out-of-bounds in American education today. His brute frankness which cut through canards, shoddy thinking, and superficial analysis, would be intolerable to the Minions of Political Correctness (Jewish Political Correctness) that control what passes for education in the United States now. It was my privilege to have one last conversation with him by telephone, when visiting Honolulu for my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary in 1991, 20 years after I left Iolani School as a student. I shall never forget him. I have thought of him many times in all the years since. When we got to the subject of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and World War II one morning at Iolani School, Sleight became especially serious. He made it clear that he did not agree with the Establishment Consensus on FDR, or the events that led up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. His reasons for this statement were not entirely elaborated upon with the class, but I noticed that the bibliography he distributed on these subjects included a section entitled Revisionist History Books on Roosevelt and Pearl Harbor. When I returned to my home at Hickam AFB in Honolulu on the Pearl Harbor Channel Entrance on Julian Avenue that evening, I began looking at this particular section of the bibliography. The titles told me something about the contents of the books. (I have recently gone back into this fine but dated bibliography, at the suggestion of Dr. Paul Sheldon Foote of Cal State-Fullerton, to add the Hamilton Fish volume entitled “Tragic Deception: FDR and America’s Involvement in World War II.” Did President Franklin Delano Roosevelt really know in advance that the American Pacific Fleet was going to be attacked at Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7th, 1941? Was that information deliberately withheld from the American Commanders at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short? If so, why? The mere thought of something like this alternated in my mind between the preposterous and the monstrous. Could anyone really seriously entertain this idea who was sane? I could not sleep in my bedroom at Hickam AFB that night. My night thoughts would not allow my mind a nocturnal peace, despite the Pacific Ocean breeze and the sound of rustling palm trees outside my window. The American Air Force planes that constantly overflew my home on Julian Avenue, headed toward a landing strip at Hickam’s Military Airlift Command (MAC) terminal, also punctuated a sleepless night. I made a private appointment to see Captain Sleight in his academic office at Iolani School. When I arrived, he pointed to a chair in front of his desk. He had the same demeanor as other military men I had grown up around in the Air Force, when serious conversation was imminent. He told me to sit down. Sleight asked me why I had come in, what the nature of my concern was. I was just as much to the point. Basically, I indicated I’d like to know what Revisionist History was. And whether or not he thought there was any truth to what I was picking up on in the bibliography he had passed out to the class, regarding President Roosevelt having advance knowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American Pacific Fleet. He lit his infamous pipe and looked at me with a seriously piercing examination I had never quite seen before. His question to me, before proceeding, was one I have heard a thousand times, as the son of a military man, a Lutheran pastor, an activist, and a journalist: “Are we speaking totally off-the-record here?“ I indicated that we were. Sleight then proceeded. I will never forget what he said, and how clearly and powerfully he said it, while continuing to pierce me with the penetrating focus he always had when zeroing in on something that was pivotal. What he said was simply this: “Roosevelt not only knew about the attack in advance, he deliberately provoked it, from October of 1940 onward. And the United States not only had the capability to intercept Japanese diplomatic communications, as the Tora! Tora! Tora! movie (1971) depicts, but had the network and the active Naval Intelligence operation going on throughout the Pacific, to intercept Japanese military communications. “We were listening in constantly on [Admiral] Yamamoto’s radio communications with [Admiral] Nagumo, after Nagumo departed from Hitokappu Bay in Japan in late November of 1941 with the six (6) aircraft carriers which comprised the task force which ended up 200 miles north of here, launching the attack on Pearl, Wheeler, Schofield, Hickam, Shafter, and Kaneohe on December 7th. If you want to know why, you have to find out about the [Arthur] McCollum memorandum to Roosevelt in October of 1940. That’s the Rosetta Stone.“ How, I asked, do I find this stuff? Answer: “Presently, you won’t. I know about it from classified Naval Intelligence materials I’ve seen, and my conversations with a couple of the guys doing the cryptology and the intercepting in the project which was intercepting Japanese military communications. That stuff, and the very existence of the program, is still top secret. Maybe in your lifetime, you’ll be able to see the evidence on paper.” My last remark was that I had just seen a documentary film on Roosevelt’s speech to the 1940 Democratic National Convention, assuring Americans he would keep their kids out of any European, or foreign war, period. Captain Sleight cut to the chase: “Roosevelt was a duplicitous, lying son of a bitch. He lied this country into a war that was totally avoidable. If he’s the model of the American Presidency in the world we live in now, God help us. The Mythology that surrounds this guy is enough to make you puke. And don’t ever forget it.“ I never did forget it. And yes, thanks to Robert Stinnett, author of Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor, and his Freedom of Information Act law suit against the Federal Government of the United States, the evidence is now in for all to see. Stinnett was one of those secret cryptographers in the network that was intercepting Japanese military communications in the Pacific, and the specific conversations between Yamamoto and Nagumo that Captain R. C. Sleight had told me about in Honolulu decades before. His book includes the infamous McCollum Memorandum of October 1940 and its so-called Eight (8) Point Action Memo“designed to provoke Japan into an overt act of war.” The complete text of the McCollum Memorandum is presented in Appendix A of the Stinnett book, which provides a photographic copy of what Stinnett discovered personally in Box 6 of a special U. S. Navy collection in RG 38 in the Military Reference Branch of Archives II, January 24, 1995. Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. McCollum, fluent in Japanese as one who grew up in Japan as the son of American Baptist missionaries there, was the head of the Far East desk of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). His office was an element of Station US, a secret American cryptographic center located at the main naval headquarters at 18th Street and Constitution Avenue N. W., about four blocks from the White House. As Stinnett freely admits it in Day of Deceit, the Eight (8) Point Action Memo called for “virtually inciting a Japanese attack on American ground, air and naval forces in Hawaii, as well as on British and Dutch colonial outposts in the Pacific region.” The Eight (8) Points are as follows: Make an arrangement with Britain for the use of British bases in the Pacific, particularly Singapore. Make an arrangement with Holland for the use of base facilities and acquisition of supplies in the Dutch East Indies [now Indonesia]. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek. Send a division of long-range heavy cruisers to the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient. Keep the main strength of the U. S. Fleet, now in the Pacific, in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. Insist that the Dutch refuse to grant Japanese demands for undue economic concessions, particularly oil. Completely embargo all trade with Japan, in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed by the British Empire. It is critical that we understand the exact timing of this Eight (8) Point Action Memo of Lieutenant Commander Arthur McCollum, as Stinnett explains it to us: “[Admiral] Richardson’s removal [as CINCPAC, or Commander in Chief Pacific] on February 1st, 1941, strengthened the position of McCollum. Only five months earlier, in mid-September 1940, Germany and her Axis partner, Italy, had signed a mutual-assistance alliance with Japan. The Tripartite Pact committed the three partners to assist each other in the event of an attack on any one of them. “McCollum saw the alliance as a golden opportunity. “If Japancould be provoked into committing an overt act of war against the United States, then the Pact’s mutual assistance provisions would kick in. It was a back-door approach: Germany and Italy would come to Japan’s aid and thus directly involve the United States in the European war.” Thus, the roadmap for what Stinnett terms “FDR’s Back Door to War” was set. Perhaps the greatest indication of the mindset of both Arthur McCollum and Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the former’s “Action D,” which involved the deliberate deployment of American warships within or adjacent to the territorial waters of Japan. We now know that FDR personally took charge of secret White House meetings where Action D was discussed and implemented. The President termed these illegal and reckless provocations “pop-up” cruises. These cruises were opposed by Admiral Husband Kimmel (CINCPAC commander) who objected to Action D as “. . . ill-advised and will result in war if we make this move.” Stinnett notes that: “From March through July 1941, White House records show that FDR ignored international law and dispatched naval task groups into Japanese waters on three such pop-up cruises. One of the most provocative was a sortie into the Bungo Strait southeast of Honshu, the principal access to Japan’s Inland Sea. The strait separates the home islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, and was a favored operational area for the warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1941.” Footnote 11 for chapter 2 of Day of Deceit clinches how deeply involved Franklin Roosevelt was in these reckless, illegal, provocative, and un-Constitutional actions embodied in Action D. Stinnett’s footnote states: “Documentation that directly links FDR with McCollum’s Action D–sending US Navy cruisers in provocative moves against Japan includes the following: the first discussion in the White House February 10, 1941. Present were President Roosevelt; Secretary of State, Cordell Hull; Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson; Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox; General George Marshall, Army Chief of Staff; and Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations. Stark warned FDR that the cruises “will precipitate hostilities.” PHPT 16-2150 and PHPT 33, p. 1203. FDR advocated the cruises, says Stark in PHPT 33, p. 1203.” This article was first published in the fall of 2017.

    "articleText": "Medieval roundhouse identified using laser scans of the Isle of Arran. (Historic Environment Scotland) Lasers Help Scientists Spot 900 New Archaeological Sites on Scotland’s Isle of Arran by Jason Daley Smithsonian.com The Isle of Arran located off Scotland’s west coast is one of the most archaeologically rich sites in all of Great Britain. The island is home to some of the British Isles’ most impressive prehistoric sites, featuring Neolithic stone circles and standing stones, ancient burial grounds and cairns, and the remains of Stone Age and Bronze Age homes. Now, a recent airborne laser scan of the area has found 900 previously unknown archaeological sites on Arran, promising to rewrite the 6,000-year human history of the island, the BBC reports. Some of the newly spotted sites include medieval farmsteads, prehistoric settlements and a rare cursus monument, which is a ceremonial ditch with parallel earthworks on either side that is not normally found on Scotland’s west coast, according to a project description from Historic Environment Scotland, the agency that conducted the survey. “This survey has shown us that there are double the number of ancient monuments on Arran than we previously knew about,” Dave Cowley, rapid archaeological mapping manager at Historic Environment Scotland, tells the BBC.

    "articleText": "By Nauman Sadiq for VT Islamabad Christianity in its present form came into being after the eleventh century schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Church. Before that, it used to be an exclusively Byzantine affair and most of Western Europe followed pagan customs. The reason why Catholic historians fabricated the history of ancient Roman civilization was to dissociate Christianity from its Byzantine heritage. The theory that Christianity spread into Europe, and also in Russia, from the Byzantine Empire is validated by the fact that early Middle Ages – from 5th to 10th century, when the Byzantine Empire reached its zenith and a split occurred between the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic churches in 1054 – are referred to as Dark Ages, whereas the period between 8th century BC and 6th century AD is rather ironically called Classical Antiquity. There appears to be clear historical bias because in descending order, as we go back in time, the reliability of information reduces proportionally. Thus, the 11th century recorded history of the Roman Catholic Church is comparatively credible, whereas Before Christ folklore transmitted mainly through oral traditions of fabulists is simply implausible. Historically, on Christmas Day 800 AD, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, forming the political and religious foundations of Christendom and establishing in earnest the French monarchy’s longstanding historical association with the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, ninth century appears to be a watershed moment of increasing proselytization of Europe to Christianity, which obviously had its impact in Britain and Germany later. After that, the influence of the Byzantine Empire, lasting from 4th to 15th centuries, waned and a rival power center emerged in the form of Roman Catholic Church patronized by kings of Franks and Lombards in Italy. Evidently, Christianization of Eastern Europe and Russia is attributed to the Byzantine Empire and Western Europe to the Holy Roman Empire. Thus, the history of ancient Romans, whose empire purportedly fell in 476 AD to Germanic tribes, is nothing more than folklore and the history of the Roman Catholic Church in earnest began after the coronation of Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor. The title of Holy Roman Emperor remained with Carolingian family of Charlemagne, the ruler of Franks, up to 840, and then it passed on to Germans when Otto I was declared Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 962. Thus, the Frankish Empire constituted the Holy Roman Empire during the early 9th century, and then the title was assumed by the Germanic Empire for the next eight centuries. The Germanic decentralized phase of the Holy Roman Empire never reached the glory of the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne and his successor Louis the Pious. They adopted Latin as the official language of the Empire to forge a political identity distinct from the Byzantine Greeks. Carolingians jointly ruled over Franks and Lombards in Italy, thus the Roman Catholic Church was under their suzerainty, which at the time was nothing more than a diocese of the Eastern Orthodox Church. During the period of the Byzantine Papacy from 6th to 8th centuries, the title of the Pope was equivalent to the bishop of Rome. Although according to oral traditions, the Roman Catholic Church was founded by the apostles of Jesus, St. Peter and Paul, and was recognized by Byzantine Emperor Constantine, it’s not proved by credible history and many secular historians doubt the assertion. In the medieval era, the theological creed of the Eastern Orthodox Church was vilified as Arian heresy by the Roman Catholic Church to establish a monopoly over Christian faith in Western Europe. Arius was a theologian of the Antioch school in Hatay province of modern Turkey in 270 AD. Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which later transformed into German Protestantism. It is generally claimed that Byzantine Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity and reorganized the Empire from 324 to 337 AD. Moreover, it is also alleged, albeit mistakenly, that under the reign of Heraclius (610–641), three centuries later, the Empire adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin. Fact of the matter, however, is the Byzantine Empire wasn’t a monolith, as it had myriad dynasties of usurpers from Macedonia, Armenia etc. which spoke several East European dialects, but Latin was never introduced into the Byzantine Empire. In fact, the Byzantine Empire appears to be a continuation of Alexander’s Hellenistic Empire, as both had their arch-foes in the ancient kingdoms of Persia – Achaemenids and Sassanids. The Justinian dynasty is generally regarded as the Golden Age of the Byzantine Empire that lasted from 518 to 602 AD. During the reign of Justinian I (527–565), the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the western Mediterranean coast, North Africa, Italy, and Rome itself, which it held for two more centuries.

According to a New York Times report [1], the surprising information about the Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts came following the arrest and interrogation of one of al-Baghdadi’s wives and a courier in Iraq this past summer. The report details the chronology of the US Special Ops overnight raid: “Around midnight Sunday morning — 5 p.m. Saturday in Washington — eight American helicopters, primarily CH-47 Chinooks, took off from a military base near Erbil, Iraq. Flying low and fast to avoid detection, the helicopters quickly crossed the Syrian border and then flew all the way across Syria itself — a dangerous 70-minute flight in which the helicopters took sporadic groundfire — to the Barisha area just north of Idlib city, in western Syria.” Before the publishing of the NY Times report, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported earlier [2] on Sunday that a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by warplanes belonging to the international coalition, had attacked positions of Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, in Idlib province where the Islamic State chief was believed to be hiding. Despite detailing the operational minutiae of the Special Ops raid, however, the NY Times deliberately elided over the crucial piece of information that the compound in Barisha village 5 km. from Turkish border where al-Baghdadi was killed belonged to Hurras al-Din, which has previously been targeted several times in the US airstrikes. Although Hurras al-Din is generally assumed to be an al-Qaeda affiliate, it is in fact regrouping of the Islamic State’s jihadists in northwestern Idlib after the latter terrorist organization was routed from Mosul and Raqqa and was hard pressed by the US-led coalition’s air raids in eastern Syria. It’s worth pointing out that the distinction between Islamic jihadists and purported “moderate rebels” in Syria is more illusory than real. Before it turned rogue and overran Mosul in Iraq in June 2014, Islamic State used to be an integral part of the Syrian opposition and enjoyed close ideological and operational ties with other militant groups in Syria. Thus, though practically impossible, even if Washington does eliminate all Islamic State militants from Syria, what would it do with myriads of other militant outfits in Syria, particularly with tens of thousands of al-Nusra Front jihadists, including the transnational terrorists of Hurras al-Din, who have carved out a new sanctuary in Syria’s northwestern Idlib governorate since 2015? The only practical solution to the conundrum is to withdraw all American troops from Syria and let Damascus establish writ of the state over all of Syria in order to eliminate all militant groups from Syria, including the jihadists of the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front and Hurras al-Din, though the foreign policy hawks in Washington might have objections to strengthening the hands of Iran and Russia in Syria. Before the evacuation of 1,000 American troops from northern Syria to western Iraq, the Pentagon had 2,000 US forces in Syria. After the drawdown of US troops at Erdogan’s insistence in order for Ankara to mount a ground offensive in northern Syria, the US still has 1,000 troops, mainly in oil-rich, eastern Deir al-Zor province and at al-Tanf military base. Al-Tanf military base is strategically located in southeastern Syria on the border between Syria, Iraq and Jordan, and it sits on a critically important Damascus-Baghdad highway, which serves as a lifeline for Damascus. Washington has illegally occupied 55-kilometer area around al-Tanf since 2016, and several hundred US Marines have trained several Syrian militant groups there. It’s worth noting that rather than fighting the Islamic State, the purpose of continued presence of the US forces at al-Tanf military base is to address Israel’s concerns regarding the expansion of Iran’s influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Washington’s interest in the Syrian proxy war has been mainly about ensuring Israel’s regional security. The United States Defense Intelligence Agency’s declassified report [3] of 2012 clearly spelled out the imminent rise of a Salafist principality in northeastern Syria – in Raqqa and Deir al-Zor which were occupied by the Islamic State until October 2017 – in the event of an outbreak of a civil war in Syria. Under pressure from the Zionist lobby in Washington, however, the former Obama administration deliberately suppressed the report and also overlooked the view in general that a proxy war in Syria would give birth to radical Islamic jihadists. The hawks in Washington were fully aware of the consequences of their actions in Syria, but they kept pursuing the ill-fated policy of nurturing militants in the training camps located in Syria’s border regions with Turkey and Jordan in order to weaken the anti-Zionist Syrian government. The single biggest threat to Israel’s regional security was posed by the Iranian resistance axis, which is comprised of Tehran, Damascus and their Lebanon-based surrogate, Hezbollah. During the course of 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets into northern Israel and Israel’s defense community realized for the first time the nature of threat that Hezbollah and its patrons posed to Israel’s regional security. Those were only unguided rockets but it was a wakeup call for Israel’s military strategists that what will happen if Iran passed the guided missile technology to Hezbollah whose area of operations lies very close to the northern borders of Israel. Therefore, the Zionist lobbies in Washington literally coerced then-President Obama to coordinate a proxy war against Damascus and its Lebanon-based surrogate Hezbollah in order to dismantle the Iranian resistance axis against Israel. Over the years, Israel has not only provided medical aid and material support to militant groups battling Damascus – particularly to various factions of the Free Syria Army (FSA) and al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate al-Nusra Front in Daraa and Quneitra bordering the Israel-occupied Golan Heights – but Israel’s air force virtually played the role of air force of Syrian jihadists and conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Syria during the eight-year conflict. In an interview to New York Times [4] in January, Israel’s outgoing Chief of Staff Lt. General Gadi Eisenkot confessed that the Netanyahu government approved his shift in strategy in January 2017 to step up airstrikes in Syria. Consequently, more than 200 Israeli airstrikes were launched against the Syrian targets in 2017 and 2018, as revealed [5] by the Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz in September last year. In 2018 alone, Israel’s air force dropped 2,000 bombs in Syria. The purpose of Israeli airstrikes in Syria has been to degrade Iran’s guided missile technology provided to Damascus and Hezbollah, which poses an existential threat to Israel’s regional security. Though after Russia provided S-300 missile system to the Syrian military after a Russian surveillance plane was shot down in Syria on September 18 last year, killing 15 Russians onboard, Israel’s airstrikes in Syria have been significantly reduced.

    "description": "\"The fastest way to get expelled from a British university is by saying you are looking at chemical evidence for how Zyklon was used in World War II, with a discussion of how delousing technology functioned in the German World War II labour camps.\"",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis and Nicholas Kollerstrom Nicholas Kollerstrom has a B.A. in the natural sciences from Cambridge University, with an emphasis on the history and philosophy of science. He is also an astronomer, receiving his Ph.D. from the University College London. He was a former correspondent for the BBC and received grants from the Royal Astronomical Society to do scientific work related to the discovery of Neptune. Kollerstrom has written numerous technical articles and essays.[1] He is the author of Newton’s Forgotten Lunar Theory: His contribution to the Quest for Longitude (London: Green Lion Press, 2000) and The Metal-Planet Relationship: A Study of Celestial Influence (Eureka, CA: Borderland Sciences Research Foundation, 1993). Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers contained several of his essays on mathematician and astronomer John Couch Adams (1819-1892), astronomer John Flamsteed (1646-1719), and Isaac Newton. But because he has challenged the Holocaust establishment using science and reason, all his work was removed from the Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers. Kollerstrom was widely cited in the scholarly literature.[2] Then he began to be an intellectual outcast because he started to look at chemical evidence for how Zyklon was used during World War II. Graham Macklin, manager of the research service at the National Archives, scorns at Kollerstrom’s claims that Auschwitz-Birkenau had a swimming pool for inmates and that the inmates themselves used to listen to orchestras.[3] Macklin, because he is part of the establishment, could not investigate or refute the claim using reason because that would ruin his reputation. Therefore he chose the easy route: mockery and ridicule. But Kollestrom was not the only person to say this. People who were actually at the camp testified the same thing. Historian Paul Berben, who actually talked to numerous survivors after the camp was liberated and who meticulously looked into the archives, wrote in Dachau: The Official History: “A few sporting and cultural activities were authorized. Officially the S.S. could no longer maltreat the inmates as they liked. But the disciplinary regime remained very harsh.”[4] Even “money brought on arrival and any that was subsequently sent to a prisoner was credited to him, and he could only draw 15 R.M. monthly. As some prisoners had considerable sums of money, especially in the early years, the S.S. conducted profitable financial transactions. When in 1942 the system of ‘gift coupons’ was instituted, the prisoners could no longer have money in their possession. The money in their account had to be used for the purchase of articles obtainable at the canteen, another course of considerable profit to the camp administration.”[5] Berben notes that “theatrical entertainments, concerts, revues and lectures were arranged too. Among the thousands of men who lived in the camp there were all sorts of talents, great and small, to be found: famous musicians, good amateur musicians, theatre and musical artists. Many of these men devoted their time in the most admirable way to gain a few moments of escape for their comrades in misery, and to keep up their morale. And these activities helped too to create a feeling of fellowship.”[6] The following may shock you: “The camp had a library which started in a modest way but which eventually stocked some fifteen thousand volumes. It had been formed with the books brought in by prisoners or sent to them by their families, or from gifts. There was a very varied choice, from popular novels to the great classics, and scientific and philosophical works. “Only books in German and at the most a few dictionaries were allowed, but there were some ‘forbidden’ volumes there too, whose bindings had been camouflaged by the prisoner-librarians and which received particular attention from those who were ‘in the know.’ “The intellectuals in the camp kept the catalogues up to date and were in charge of lending out the books. Unfortunately, it was not possible for more than a very few prisoners to do any reading, so it was mainly only those lucky enough to be attached to the library who benefited from it. “Yet it is astonishing to learn that some men in spite of their miserable convicts’ existence nevertheless found the energy to take an interest in the arts, in science and in philosophical problems.”[7] In addition, letters sent to individual families “had to be written in German and to one single recipient. Contents had to deal only with family matters and no reference at all was permitted to life in the camp, or the letter was not sent off.”[8] During the last few years of the war, “it was decreed that a prisoner could send or receive two letters or two cards per month. He had to write in ink, very legibly, on the fifteen lines of each page of a letter. His correspondent could only use plain paper, and double envelopes were not allowed.”[9] Jewish historian Sarah Gordon corroborated many similar claims in her book Hitler, Germans, and the Jewish Question, which was published by Princeton University Press in 1984.[10] Putting all the pieces together, can popular historians in good conscience ignore these facts and perpetuate one incoherent assertion after another without sober thought? If Plato is right, that “having a grasp of the truth is having a belief that matches the way things are” and that “being deceived about the truth is a bad thing,”[11] how can scholars and thinking people pursue the truth if they are not allowed to ask deeper questions about the past? Weren’t we told in grade school that science begins by asking fundamental questions? Did our science teachers lie to us by exposing us to the scientific method? Did our history teachers deceive us by telling us to dig into archives, look for historical documentations and to watch out for contradictions? Furthermore, would people like Descartes, Kant, Hegel, etc., make it in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, where draconian speech codes can be found throughout Europe and America and where professors are scared to death to talk freely about certain issues?[12] Wouldn’t they be asked to seal their lips and drop their pens without rational discourse? Wouldn’t the Holocaust establishment dispatch an exorcist from Tel Aviv to cast out Descartes’ demon in France? We are going to explore some of these questions in the following interview with Nicholas Kollestrom. Alexis: Kollestrom, let’s start with a statement from your book. You write: “The fastest way to get expelled from a British university is by saying you are looking at chemical evidence for how Zyklon was used in World War II, with a discussion of how delousing technology functioned in the German World War II labour camps. “This is considered to be absolutely forbidden. How strange is that? After being a member of my college for 15 years I was thrown out with one day’s warning, having been given no opportunity to defend myself, a fact announced on its website. What I had done was so terrible that it could not announce what my crime was: I felt like Faust caught making his pact with the devil.”[13] This is quite puzzling. Don’t scientists pride themselves in looking for rigorous evidence? Don’t academic centers like the University College of London boast about free speech, particularly when a person is a noted scholar? Were you using the scientific method when you were investigating how Zyklon was used during World War II? If so, why did the academic community go banana? Did you ask them about your academic sin? Kollerstrom: I guess it was just too much for them to handle. I was a science historian in a ‘Science and Technology Studies’ department at UCL in London, Britain’s 3rd oldest university, which was supposedly set up on a secular basis, that there would not be any inquisition about private beliefs of its members of staff. But I had to realize that belief in ‘the Holocaust’ is nowadays some sort of religion, it’s the one thing that academics are not allowed to doubt or criticise. They put up on their UCL website that they were totally opposed to what I was doing, but did not say what the terrible thing was! There was just silence from my colleagues or rather ex-colleagues and I had to realise that I’d never get another paper published in an academic journal. Sure I was using the scientific method, I was comparing and critiquing two different published surveys of residual cyanide in the walls of German WW2 labor-camps. They both used much the same method of analyzing the cyanide so I pooled the two data-sets together. This gave about forty measurable samples which is quite a decent sample. What was puzzling was that in all the media damnation that ensued, no-one was interested in what I’d actually done, in the basic chemistry, it was just ‘We’ve found a Nazi!’ Alexis: Serious scientists like yourself are always on a quest for the truth, asking probing questions and discerning between evidence in order to give an accurate explanation of the available data and controversial issues. Once all rival alternatives are weighted, then inference to the best explanations should be drawn.[14] Do you think people are afraid to look at the evidence because they might find something that would not be compatible with their preconceived ideas? Are some people playing fast and loose with the facts? Kollerstrom: You have well described what the scientific method is supposed to be. I believe what is going on here is a clash between science and religion, where ethically-damned Revisionists are trying to look at scientific evidence to reconstruct the past and Holocaust-legislators wish to ban any doubt over their official narrative. My wish here is that some kind of forum could exist where different views of what happened in WW2 could be discussed. If we don’t believe in rational debate then we’re lost. You might suppose that science historians could discuss say hygiene delousing technology prior to DDT. You might suppose that is obscure enough to be a non-explosive topic. DDT started to be widely used after WW2 for this purpose. Before that for, say, forty years Zyklon delousing chambers were the normal way of doing it. It was normal hygiene technology for killing bugs in clothing and so on. So no-one’s allowed to discuss this, because that would violate the new religion, because it would soon end belief in the huge human gas chambers that existed only in WW2, only in Poland. Alexis: Scientist and academic professionals are to be skeptical about claims or assertions or even documents and examine them in light of various sources to corroborate and even challenge accepted views. If the documents show contradictions, or if they challenge our preconceived vision, then we need to slow down and reconsider our worldviews to see whether they were based on evidence or popular opinion. Why are people in the Holocaust establishment afraid to examine their metaphysical assumptions? The first principle in examining any scientific or historical account is that truth exists—even if historians or scientists do not know what it is at the moment of investigation. If truth does not exist, then ultimately the scientist is wasting his time looking for clues, which lead to hypotheses, theories, and ultimately scientific “facts.” Do people in the Holocaust establishment believe that truth actually exists? Do they think that truth is to be pursued and fabrications and colossal hoaxes ought to be avoided? I have interacted with a number of academics over the years on this issue, and I was quite stunned to realize that not a single one of them actually believes in serious scholarship, despite the fact that they write books superficially postulating that evidence matters. One of them would not even give me permission to publish the interaction because that would ruin what he said in a book which was ironically published by the University of California Press. Kollerstrom: I reckon they, i.e. people in the Holocaust establishment, believe that truth is what they want to believe.[15] They will always endeavor to undermine historical-factual debate about What Really Happened with claims about alleged emotions, of love or hate, such as: ‘You are just an anti-Semite’, or ‘You really hate …’ Whatever.[16] Or they will claim to be hurt. My colleague Richard D. Hall who does ‘RichPlanet’ recently wrote to various different Jewish ‘Holocaust’ groups in the UK which are especially concerned with ‘Holocaust education’ – and that is big business over here – asking if they could provide anyone who could debate the issue, but none of them would. The professional skepticism of scientists just goes right out of the window where this topic is concerned I’m afraid. I agree with you totally about the mental enslavement which academics here display. For example, a few years ago a team from Britain’s University of Birmingham science department went to Treblinka with ‘ground penetrating radar’ equipment. They didn’t find a single gassed body, or any bodies under the ground come to that, no gas chambers, zilch. No wait, they found some shark’s teeth in the ground. This was promoted by the British media as having confirmed the canonical story that eight hundred thousand people mainly Jews had been gassed using diesel exhaust in that transit-camp. Was the British scientific establishment bothered that diesel-exhaust is not actually lethal and couldn’t have gassed anyone? No, evidently not. Or, to give a US example, Elie Wiesel’s Night (which has supposedly sold twelve million copies) has been used in many ‘Holocaust study’ courses in American universities. That features the primary Holo-image of burning piles of human corpses. They are just set on fire, and they burn. Why has not the US Society for Advancement of Science protested at such nonsense being taught in universities? Alexis: I read Nick Cohen’s article in the Guardian about you and I was completely shocked to read some of the statements that this man propounded. He titled his article: “When academics lose their power of reason.” Does an academic lose his power to reason when he asks probing questions? Cohen quoted philosopher Jeremy Bentham saying that “As to the evil which results from a censorship, it is impossible to measure it, for it is impossible to tell where it ends.”[17] He moved on to say that “Admittedly, if the philosopher had lived long enough to hear the conspiracy theories of the 21st century, even his defence of free speech might have weakened.”[18] I think Bentham would have been stunned to see how the Holocaust establishment itself is an impediment to serious science, history and reason, since true science is determined by rigorous evidence, not by ad hominem attack, straw man and red herring such as “conspiracy theories.” Would you agree? I am pretty sure that Cohen has never read your work on some of these issues. In fact, you state quite rationally in the book: “We need to find out how to discuss [the ‘Holocaust’] calmly, how to respect different viewpoints, and what are the primary sources we should be consulting.”[19] Kollerstrom: Sure. I got vilified by Nick Cohen in The Observer right after being chucked out of my College – having been in it for fifteen years – and discovered that I was allowed no right of reply. The Observer thereby put a death-wish against me by allowing Cohen to say I needed to be stuffed and put next to Jeremy Bentham (his stuffed body being on display at UCL). As you note, Cohen was there dismissing conclusions drawn from measurements of cyanide in the walls of the German labor-camps as a ‘conspiracy theory.’ He used an effective form of discourse designed to terminate debate and replace it with a fairly simple emotion – hate. A lot of people hated me after I’d been through all this, and that was a new experience. Alexis: You wrote: “After somewhat over a decade of quiet academic research, my life changed rather abruptly as I became ethically damned, thrown out of polite, decent groups, banned from forums and denounced in newspapers, with half my friends not speaking to me anymore—while the other half still would, provided I kept off ‘that awful subject.’ “So as a philosopher I was granted an unusual and excellent opportunity to ponder the difference between what is real and what is illusory. I should be grateful to my fellow-countrymen for absolutely refusing rational debate on this topic, for insisting on my silence over it, and for transforming discussion into insult. “I know what I have been through. I have been well-cooked…The damnation cast upon me was ostensibly political…Going into my local, or even my gym, I felt as if some Mark of Cain had been branded onto my forehead.”[20] You also said that “no one seemed interested in what I had actually done, namely synthesize a couple of chemical investigations concerning residual wall-cyanide taken from World War II labour camps.”[21] Now, that is the work of a serious scientist. What kind of investigation do you think the Holocaust establishment was expecting? Did you ever ask some of their representatives the kind of evidence or scientific enquiry they would accept? Kollerstrom: Plato’s metaphor of the Cave seems to have suddenly become very relevant in the 21st century. He there described how people were chained to see just the flickering images on the wall, which they mistake for reality. They become furious with any persons who come from the above-ground world who try to tell them about it and seek to destroy them. We surely have to believe – as you Sir have tried to show in various articles – in some sort of Logos principle which means that we can by debate find together by logic whatever the truth is. I think that the ‘Holocaust establishment’ is concerned to promote stories, of alleged ‘Holocaust survivors. We need to bear in mind the catastrophic situation that has here developed, where the German government has been paying and continues to pay anyone who claims to be such a Holocaust-survivor.[22] That is a very strong motivation for memory-enhancement, shall we say. These people then go into schools. Their ‘memories’ are promoted by the Establishment, and anyone who challenges the accepted wisdom gets ethically-damned. The UCL I would want to have belonged to would have had detailed debate about brick and wall absorption of cyanide gas, the nature of the ferrocyanide complex and when it turns blue, and whether it remains permanently in the brick. It would have commissioned a new investigation to go and visit Birkenau-Auschwitz and chip away some further brick samples, and used the very latest chemical-assay procedures for measuring the cyanide.

She wanted to have a life on land. Over the past 30 years we have seen other movies in which the characters want to be “different” than how they are meant to be. In these movies was the subtle message that it is okay to explore who you want to be. The Disney corporation would have never been able to continue if it has not embraced this trend in how someone looks at how he or she fits into society and how much he or she wants to pursue what makes him or her happy. We need to look at others with a broad pallet and say and believe it is okay to be “different.” ..Carol ‘The Little Mermaid’ Was Way More Subversive Than You Realized by Michael Landis/Smithsonian/com A drag show? Gay rights? Body image issues? Hardly the stuff of Disney animation, but 30 years ago, Disney’s The Little Mermaid tackled these topics and made a courageous statement about identity in Reagan-era America. Moreover, the movie not only saved the company from almost certain death, but allowed Disney to become the international corporate juggernaut we know today. Without the brave storytellers and desperate animators of The Little Mermaid, moviegoers would have missed out on the new classics of Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). And without the profits from those films, Disney would not have had the capital to build new parks and resorts, invest in new media ventures, or expand its urban planning program, let alone gobble up Pixar, Marvel, Fox, the Star Wars universe, National Geographic, ESPN, A&E and Hulu—moves entirely unthinkable back in the 1980s, when the corporation was in its darkest hour. When Walt Disney died suddenly in 1966, his company was left aimless. “The creative atmosphere for which the Company has so long been famous and on which it prides itself has, in my opinion, become stagnant,” wrote Walt’s nephew Roy E. Disney in his 1977 resignation letter from Walt Disney Productions (though he retained his seat on the board). Read more: Loading...

In a report published in the journal BioScience, over 11,000 of the world’s leading climate scientists have added their names to a declaration calling the planet’s current warming trends a “climate emergency.” Titled “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency,” the paper takes an urgent tone, detailing a dire situation that will require extreme responses to avert disaster. “As a scientist, I feel that I must speak out about climate change, since it is such a severe threat to humanity,” says Bill Ripple, an ecologist at Oregon State University and lead author of the new report. In addition to a warning about the future, Ripple, his co-authors and the 11,258 other people who attached their names to the paper suggest a set of tools to make sense of our changing world. The paper, which looks at 40 years of climate data, argues that scientists as well as world leaders should start moving away from using a single number to track the progress of climate change: global average surface temperature.

    "articleText": "After two eclipse expeditions confirmed Einstein's theory of general relativity, the scientist became an international celebrity. (The New York Times Archives / Photo Illustration by Shaylyn Esposito) One Hundred Years Ago, Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity Baffled the Press and the Public by Dan Falk/Smithsonian.com When the year 1919 began, Albert Einstein was virtually unknown beyond the world of professional physicists. By year’s end, however, he was a household name around the globe. November 1919 was the month that made Einstein into “Einstein,” the beginning of the former patent clerk’s transformation into an international celebrity. On November 6, scientists at a joint meeting of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Astronomical Society announced that measurements taken during a total solar eclipse earlier that year supported Einstein’s bold new theory of gravity, known as general relativity. Newspapers enthusiastically picked up the story. “Revolution in Science,” blared the Times of London; “Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.” A few days later, the New York Times weighed in with a six-tiered headline—rare indeed for a science story. “Lights All Askew in the Heavens,” trumpeted the main headline. A bit further down: “Einstein’s Theory Triumphs” and “Stars Not Where They Seemed, or Were Calculated to Be, But Nobody Need Worry.” The spotlight would remain on Einstein and his seemingly impenetrable theory for the rest of his life. As he remarked to a friend in 1920: “At present every coachman and every waiter argues about whether or not the relativity theory is correct.” Read more: Loading...

    "articleText": "www.pinterest.com How Washington keeps America sick and fat by Politico What Americans eat is making us sick on a staggering scale, but judging by federal investment in nutrition research, Washington doesn’t seem to care. Diet-related illnesses like obesity, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure are on the rise while heart disease remains the leading cause of death. Treating these intertwined epidemics is a top driver of ballooning U.S. health care costs. But even in an increasingly health-conscious America, the federal government has devoted only a tiny fraction of its research dollars to nutrition, a level that has not kept pace with the worsening crisis of diet-related diseases. Studying the relationship between diet and health is such an afterthought that Washington doesn’t even bother tracking the total amount spent each year. Story Continued Below: A POLITICO review of federal budget documents reveals that at the National Institutes of Health and the Agriculture Department — the two agencies that fund the majority of government-backed nutrition science — the share of research dollars devoted to nutrition has stayed largely flat for at least three decades, and pales in comparison to many other areas of research.

WalletHub also released its money-saving selection of 2019’s Best Military Credit Cards, along with the results of its 2019 Military Money Survey, which revealed that almost 200 million Americans agree that military families experience more financial stress than the average family, in addition to everything else they have to worry about when serving our country.

To view the full survey, please visit: https://wallethub.com/best-military-credit-cards#survey Q&A with WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou What makes a city good or bad for veterans? “Ideally, every city would roll out the red carpet for our veterans, given all they’ve sacrificed for cities and citizens all across the country. That’s not the case, however, and it ultimately comes down to prioritization and funding. Some areas simply focus on veterans affairs more than others, and some have the means to make an impact, while others don’t,” said WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou. “But the federal government is the one constant in all of this. Nationally, there is a dysfunctional relationship between the amount we spend going to war, or preparing to do so, and the amount we invest in recuperating. That needs to change. The first step: There should be no homeless veterans in the U.S. That is a national disgrace.” What can we do to reduce the stress on military families? “Military families have to put up with a lot – a lot of stress, worry, uncertainty, upheaval and much more. Some of that is unavoidable, but there are things everyone can do to lighten the load for the brave men and women of the military and those they love. One thing, of course, is to put more thought into where we send our troops and how long we make them stay, and to hold politicians accountable for the decisions they make. We can also look into things like reducing the service time needed to qualify for a pension and boosting financial literacy efforts aimed at the military community,” said WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou. Is poor financial literacy a threat to national security? “Financial illiteracy among military personnel is definitely a threat to national security. It comes down to our men and women in uniform being free from unnecessary worry and able to focus on the task at hand. Financial illiteracy compounds money problems, and money problems are the biggest source of stress for most people. Military personnel with money problems could also be targets for coercion by foreign adversaries,” said WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou. “In a broader sense, financial illiteracy across the U.S. that puts families’ finances on shaky ground adds up to cracks in the country’s economic foundation. Improving financial literacy would make the country stronger.” Does the military do enough to teach financial literacy? “The military does not do enough to teach financial literacy, but few employers or other major organizations actually do. Schools don’t even do a good enough job of educating people on money matters,” said WalletHub CEO Odysseas Papadimitriou. “Simply recognizing what’s missing is only part of the battle, though. We need action. It might even make sense to use some military funding for this national-security imperative.” Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

Par for the course, according to Lee Camp. Defending Rights & Dissent, a civil liberties group, cataloged known instances of First Amendment abuses and political surveillance by the FBI since 2010. The organization found that the feds devoted disproportionate resources to spy on peaceful left-leaning civil society groups, including Occupy Wall Street, Abolish ICE, and various anti-war movements. The bureau seemed less interested in right-wingers, even though the far-right has been responsible for countless acts of violence and terrorism in the country. None of this should surprise us, the host of Redacted Tonight said. The FBI is not in the job of protecting you. They’re in the job of protecting the ruling class system.

    "articleText": "geology.utah.gov Health Editor’s Note: Of course we know that the oceans are salty. It takes a small amount of sea water that gets into your mouth to know this fact. What I did not know is that the Great Lakes could be considered salty. While the Great Lakes have minerals they do not have sodium so they do not taste salty they are filled with minerals. The term “fresh water” must just mean no sodium but there are lots of other minerals involved. Also, an ion in water in the Great Lakes takes about 200 years before it is gone, but ions in the oceans are there for 100-200 million years. Whew! That is a long time!…..Carol Why Is the Ocean Salty? By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D./ThoughtCo Have you ever wondered why the ocean is salty? Have you wondered why lakes might not be salty? Here’s a look at what makes the ocean salty and why other bodies of water have a different chemical composition. Key Takeaways: Why Is the Sea Salty? The oceans of the world have a fairly stable salinity of about 35 parts per thousand. The main salts include dissolved sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and sodium bicarbonate. In water, these are sodium, magnesium, and potassium cations, and chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and carbonate anions. The reason the sea is salty is because it is very old. Gases from volcanoes dissolved in the water, making it acidic. The acids dissolved minerals from lava, producing ions. More recently, ions from eroded rocks entered the ocean as rivers drained into the sea. While some lakes are very salty (high salinity), some do not taste salty because they contain low amounts of sodium and chloride (table salt) ions. Others are more dilute simply because the water drains toward the sea and is replaced by fresh rainwater or other precipitation. Why the Sea Is Salty Read More: Loading...

If this is confirmed, the Syrian military may undertake offensive actions around Kbani in the near future. During the past few years, militants used Kbani as a foothold to shell and attack government-controlled areas. The liberation of this town may become a turning point in restoring security and defeating the terrorism in this part of Syria. Turkish-backed forces shelled a US military column near Tell Tamer in northeastern Syria, Maj. Gen. Yuri Borenkov, the head of the Reconciliation Russian said on November 3. No casualties were reported. Nonetheless, such developments indicate that the situation around the Ras-al-Ayn-Tell Abyad zone still remain tense. Clashes between Kurdish armed groups and Turkish-backed militants are ongoing near Sakiru, Masoudia and Umm Baramil. Both sides claim that they killed lots of enemy fighters. However, video and photo evidence from the area indicate that most of the developments are never-ending artillery duels. Meanwhile, the US-led coalition has increased its military presence in the Rumeilan oil field area. Local sources say that the number of US-linked mercenaries deployed there has also increased. US forces regularly conduct patrols between the Omar oil fields and the Rumeilan oil field. While the number of US troops deployed in northern Syria is decreasing, the US military presence along the eastern bank of the Euphrates is growing. Loading...

Since then, it has become abundantly clear that its thesis is correct. -KB In early October, violent protests broke out in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. Some of them degenerated into all-out riots. Eight members of the security forces and almost 100 civilians were killed, and more than 5,000 wounded. At the time of this writing (October 21), the situation is beginning to flare up again as the Arba‘in pilgrimage winds down. The protestors decry economic stagnation and corruption — two very real problems. But circumstantial evidence, including the timing and context of the protests, the Saudi origins of much of its social media support network, and the targeting of relatively independent Prime Minister ‘Adil ‘Abd al-Mahdi less than a year into his term, suggest that American-Zionist colonial forces may be indulging in their usual color-revolution-style shenanigans… Full article at Crescent International Loading...

    "description": "Accussed Raqqa Butcher of Paris and Brussels that murdered 162 may go free",
    "articleText": "by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio, VT Italy The nightmare is about to become reality: many dangerous Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTF) from ISIS could soon be released if the countries of origin do not accept them. Among them also the so-called “Raqqa butcher” Anwar Haddouchi, a Belgian citizen, who, in addition to being suspected of about 100 beheadings in the city of the Euphrates Valley when it was occupied by the Islamic State, is accused of helping to finance the Paris attacks in 2015 and Brussels in 2016 in which 162 people died. The threat is implicit in the appeals repeatedly reiterated by the American president Donald Trump for Europe to take charge of the criminals who left the nations of the Old Continent and in the new agreement between the US military and the Syrian Democratic Forces for the management of the approximately 12 thousand prisoners jihadists of Daesh including 2 thousand FTFs, mostly Iraqis but also many Europeans including some Italians. read more TOW MISSILES FROM CIA TO JIHADISTS But now it becomes even more imminent after the announcement by the Interior Ministry of Turkey that it has invaded Rojava, in the north-east of Syria, where most of the detainees in the SDF Kurdish militia jails are located. In recent days the government army of the Islamic dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his mercenaries of the Sunni groups, armed also with the tele-guided TOW missiles supplied by the CIA (as reported in a previous report) bombed some prisons and in particular the detention camp Ain Issa causing the flight of nearly a thousand prisoners between ISIS fighters and their families. TURKEY THREATS THE RELEASE OF FTF Yesterday, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu launched the ultimatum on foreign fighters of the Islamic State to Europe. Turkey “is not the hotel of any ISIS terrorist”, the members of the captured group “will be sent back to their countries of origin”. Leaving Turkey alone to manage the issue “is not only unacceptable but it is also irresponsible,” the minister said, criticizing the EU’s migration policy, which proves to have “zero humanity”. Islamic dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan and some Foreign Terrorist Fighters ISIS It is really strange to hear the word “humanity” pronounced by the government of Ankara that with the excuse of creating a security zone in the Syrian territory occupied by the Autonomous Administration of Rojava of the depth of 30 km, that Erdogan wanted long 460 km from Afrin to Iraqi border but the agreement with Russia has reduced to 120, it is actually carrying out the genocide of the Kurdish ethnic group, banned in Turkey since the founding of the Republic in 1922. read more HEVRIN KHALAF KILLED WITH A BARRAGE OF BULLETS On the other hand, it is not surprising that Erdogan will release the European jihadists present in the areas occupied by the Turkish militias as they are countless evidence reported in previous articles demonstrates the close connections between Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists of the Al Nusra Front (now HTS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) perched in Idlib, those of Ahrar al Sharqiyyah, mercenaries of the Turkish Operation Olive Branch that control Afrin and perpetrators of the assassin ambush of the Kurdish activist Hevrin Khalaf, and Ankara intelligence MIT, accused by a Rojava Information Center dossier of having “recycled” operational ISIS commanders in Deir Ezzor in the Sunni Islamist brigades of the so-called National Front of Liberation invented by Turkey after the failure of the Free Syrian Army (Fsa). It must also be said, as we will explain better below, that some prisons are so overcrowded that they do not allow prisoners, even simple ISIS supporters, to have a treatment that respects their human dignity. THE ISIS BELGIAN PRISONER HOPES IN TURKEY … Raqqa’s Executioner wished Turkish invasion of Rojava to hope for liberation at the beginning of October when he was interviewed by Italian journalists Alberto Marzocchi and Gianni Rosini is a great scoop for Il Fatto Quotidiano. «Everyone wants to be free, that’s normal» Anwar Haddouchi replied to the reporters’ question about his position in front of a possible Turkish military offensive. And his smile was as eloquent as a prophecy… Much more than his words seasoned with enormous lies and contradictions. First denying that he had ever killed anyone, that he had never been to Raqqa and then declaring that he had seen the killing of a man by an Isis terrorist in that stronghold of the Islamic State. Haddouchi, whose battle name was Abou Souleyman at the Belgiki also for his Belgian citizenship, was also interviewed last summer by ANF journalists, a Kurdistan media, in a maximum-security prison under the control of the Autonomous Administration of North-eastern Syria that Italian journalists have revealed to be the SDF military base of Rmelan, a town in the Hasaka governorate, 70 km from Qamishlo and 30 from Al Malikiyah, a place of strategic detention in that Syrian strip of land that wedges between Turkey and Iraq. As reported by the Syrian news agency Sana on October 19, as many as 230 foreign Daesh terrorists who had been arrested in Al Malikiya had been transported by “US occupation forces” to Al Shadadi, in the southern countryside of Hasaka, “while an American military helicopter has carried 5 Daesh detainees from the village of al-Adnaniya to Iraq “, where the revolt against the Government is taking on the characteristics of a civil war. ISIS prisoners in a maximum-security prison in Syria photographed by a Times report Haddouchi had been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces in Bagouz on 3 March 2019 and had been in detention for 7 months. The conditional is a must because neither the Rojava Information Center nor the SDF spokespersons, contacted via Twitter, Email and WhatsApp, provide news on individual FTF detainees while they are generous with updates on the numbers of the phenomenon: there are a good 347 raids in recent months chasing ISIS militants concluded with 476 arrests. An activity that fell by 75% after the aggression of Turkey, as the surveillance of the prisons dropped allowing the repeated episodes of escape following the bombing of the walls. read more ISIS PRISONERS ESCAPED FROM THE CAMP BOMBED According to Belgian intelligence, the Executioner of Raqqa would have joined ISIS in 2014 after growing up in a Muslim family of Moroccan origins, therefore adhering to the radical Sunnite Salafite Islam and having worked as a taxi driver in Brussels. He told ANF that he was influenced by Turkish and Moroccan preachers in the mosque he attended in the Belgian capital. As reported by Il Fatto Quotidiano Abou Souleyman at the Belgiki in 2009 he moved with his wife, the radicalized and his compatriot Julie Maes, to the British city of Birmingham, one of the European hubs of jihadist terrorism. THE BOIA OF RAQQA WITH BRITISH SUBSIDIES «During his five-year stay in Britain, the Executioner of Raqqa also received the subsidy for less well-off families. Money that, however, continued to flow into his current account even after he left for Syria in 2014. About 10 thousand pounds (11 thousand euros) with which he financed his stay in the Middle East and probably the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi» write the Italian FQ journalists. In September 2014 he went to Syria with his wife, passing through Turkey according to a usual Foreign Terrorist Fighters scheme. «We went from Brussels to Istanbul, then from there, we went to Antep. With the help of the people who welcomed us to Antep, we crossed the Syrian territory. Although there were Turkish soldiers along the border, we went to Syria without problems. ISIS members, who greeted us on the other side of the border, first took us to a city and then to Jarablus» the former Islamic State fighter confessed. Islamic State jihadists wave black flags after the conquest of Raqqa in January 2014 Haddouchi states that after a brief stay in Jarablus, he was taken to Raqqa where he received military training in a field and where he started living with his family. But “he did not give details of where he fought or what roles he had within ISIS, and when he is reminded that he is known as” the Butcher of Raqqa “he just smiles,” writes ANF. When Raqqa was freed from the SDF, in October 2017, he moved first to Meyadin and then to the Deir Ezzor region even though he was captured in Bagouz. At the Belgiki he admits that ISIS has carried out many massacres against civilians, but stated that they were conducted according to Shari’ah law. Although he served in ISIS for 5 years, he said he regretted coming to Syria and joining ISIS. «After a few days, I realized that life here was not as they had told us. I could not express my opinion, if I had done so I would have been in danger. At that point, my bad dream started, my bad dream. I wanted to leave – he also told Italian reporters – but it wasn’t possible. I would have put my life and that of my family at risk since those who tried to escape were put in prison». His desire is to return to Belgium with his wife Julie Maes and their two children, who do not know where they are. «I know that I won’t decide where I will be tried. I am a Belgian citizen and I want to go back there with my family. If I were to be tried, I should be tried in Belgium». An appeal so far fallen on deaf ears like that of other FTF also because on the head of Haddouchi not only the accusation of being the executioner of Raqqa who carried out at least 100 beheadings for devotion to the Black Flag of the Levant but that even heavier, in front of the European and international community, to be one of the financiers of the Paris and Brussels attention. HADDOUCHI FINANCED THE MASSACRES OF PARIS AND BRUSSELS According to information from the Belgian Ministry of Finance, when he was in Raqqa, the jihadist transferred 3,500 euros from his bank account to Mohammed Abrini, a childhood friend of the Abdeslam brothers who were protagonists of the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015. «Abrini was later identified as” the man with the hat “: it is he who appears in the images of the surveillance cameras of the Zaventem airport before the bomb attack on 22 March 2016 at the terminal of the Brussels airport. Haddouchi’s money, the Belgian authorities suspect, served to finance ISIS’s attacks in Europe» recalls Il Fatto Quotidiano while ANF points out that because of these implications in 2016, the Belgian government froze his account and his wife’s. «I don’t know the Belgian terrorists – he says in an interview with Italian journalists – To get here I asked around, I searched the web. I got a mobile number and left as a tourist for Turkey in 2014». The chilling picture of the massacre in the Bataclan theater in Paris As is known, on November 13, 2015, France fell into the nightmare of terrorism: a series of coordinated attacks at various points in Paris carried out by an ISIS command consisting of nine material executors and supporters killed 130 people and wounded 350. The most serious massacre took place in the Bataclan theater where the jihadists fired bursts of semi-automatic AK-47 Kalashnikov rifles on the crowd gathered for a concert, before targeting various restaurants and clubs in the historic center of the capital. While three suicide bombers blow up outside the Stade de France during the France-Germany soccer match. It was the worst attack ever in France and the second most serious in Europe after those in Madrid in 2004. On 22 March 2016, a similar well-planned terrorist action took place in Belgium, in the capital Brussels. In the morning two distinct attacks first struck Zaventem Airport, where two explosions probably occurred from suicide bombers, and then the subway between the stations of Maelbeek and Schuman, a few steps from the European Parliament; the total victims were 32 and over 300 wounded. In the following hours the Islamic State claimed the attack. THE INERTIA OF THE EUROPEAN STATES FOR FOREIGN FIGHTERS Today, due to the inertia of various European Union states, Abou Souleyman at Belgiki risks obtaining freedom for a possible decision by the US and Turkey whether Belgium or the European Union will not intervene. To explain the reasons for the problem by launching the alarm was in September the report of Syria Study Group (SSG), a Committee for analyzing the critical issues of the civil war, published by the United States Institution of Peace in Washington and developed by academic experts, military commanders and diplomats with the help of foreign governments, associations and NGOs. This is an 80-page dossier prepared by 12 members appointed by the American Congress. read more ERDOGAN ATTACKS ROYAVA FOR HELPING JIHADISTS «The more than two thousand ISIS foreign fighters currently in SDF custody represent an important challenge. Several countries, including US allies in Europe, refuse to repatriate their own citizens, in some cases depriving them of citizenship or are willing to repatriate only select family members. Many of these countries lack the necessary evidence to blame ISIS fighters in national courts; others fear that the fighters can be sentenced only with minor charges and serve short sentences before being released» has written SSG. «States like Tunisia and Morocco are bringing back the terrorists who left their cities, while Germany has begun to recover women and children. The others, with Great Britain and France in the lead, do not want to know» remarked Il Fatto Quotidiano while the SSG report praised the action of Kosovo, Macedonia, and even Italy. The reference is to the Italian citizen of Moroccan origin, but long resident in Germany, Samir Bougana returned to Italy thanks to a sophisticated and commendable intelligence operation of AISE (the Italian counter-espionage abroad) and taken in charge by the Digos of Brescia who is trying to get from him useful information in the counter-terrorism activity. THE DRAMATIC CONDITIONS OF SDF PRISONS «The SDF has neither the capacity nor the will to retain these prisoners indefinitely. The security conditions are minimal both in IDP camps and in pop-up prisons. ISIS has exploited more prisons in Iraq to fuel its rise to power in 2012 and 2013 and is likely to be contemplating a similar strategy in Syria» noted Syrian Study Group. While the Times in recent weeks has entered one of the largest maximum-security prisons where about 5,000 former Islamic State combatants are detained, including many minors, in shocking conditions: crammed into dozens of large cells and without adequate assistance medical. Isis prisoners huddled together in one cell – click on the image to see the Times video «The US kept all media out of Syria, hiding terror training camps, secret prisons and years of oil theft. Now this problem is in our hands and it is time to do something with it before it is too late – has written ormer marines and military intelligence expert Gordon Duff, senior editor of the geopolitics and military intelligence site Veterans Today on commenting the disturbing video – One of the prime reasons for the restoration of Syrian sovereignty is for these thousands of prisoners, victims of a fake war, of fake ISIS, to be freed. At this time, the best course of action is that they are turned over to the Syrian government which, under former Minister of Justice, opened their courts and prisons to international inspection». «The Israeli-Saudi-CIA experiment in forming a nightmare nuclear terror state from the Indus to the Mediterranean must end – adds Duff – Refugees must return, these men must be released…sorted, interviewed, there are some dangerous people here, but for the most part, they belong back to work, or in the Syrian Army but not in prison». read more ALL THE MYSTERIES ABOUT AL BAGHDADI’S ALLEGED DEATH In the next report we will see the story of the most dangerous Foreign Terrorist Fighters of Swiss, Italian, Portuguese and Palestinian citizenship who are likely to return free in a mass release without any discrimination between those who are only suspected of collusion with the Islamic State and the cutthroat militiamen who they fought for the Black Flag and for the elusive Caliph Al Baghdadi, whose death declared by the American president Donald Trump remains shrouded in mystery. © 2019 Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio ORIGINAL ITALIAN VERSION MAIN SOURCES IL FATTO QUOTIDIANO – INTERVIEW WITH THE EXECUTIONER ANF – THE RAQQA’S BUTCHER WISHES TO COME BACK IN BELGIUM VETERANS TODAY – THE DISTURBING VIDEO AND THE EXPERT’S COMMENT Loading...

The next red line to cross is when the SAA breaks up a major Turkish militia attack with artillery and more than the usual handful of casualties. Will the Turkish air force then intercede, and then the Syrian airforce against the Turks? And what would the Russians do? Would the US have an interest in seeing this happen to derail the constitutional committee work? It already has boldly taken over the oil fields, with not a finger lifted by the Russian military to help Syria defend them, when everyone knows the cover of protecting them from ISIS is a big joke, with the exception of the Syrian people losing the oil revenue. As VT has been saying, at the end of the day, it is the major criminal orgs against us all, and sadly our government institutions seem to be their favorite tools … Jim W.

Click to donate >> – First published … November 11, 2019 – Fresh reinforcements of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) were deployed on November 3 in northern al-Hasakah in the country’s northeastern region. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported that the reinforcements were deployed in the towns of Abu Rasin and Umm Harmalah south of Ras al-Ayn on the border with Turkey. Photos released by the state-run agency revealed that the reinforcements included T-72 battle tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), Gvozdika self-propelled 122 mm howitzer and BM-21 Grad 122 mm rocket launchers. Abu Rasin and Umm Harmalah were attacked by Turkish-backed Syrian militants several times in the last few days. On October 30, SAA troops were forced to abandon several key positions near the two towns as a result of one of these attacks. The SAA is apparently working to establish a fire-support base, that could cover the entire Ras al-Ayn countryside, in order to stop any new attacks by Turkish-backed militants. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are likely facilitating this plan. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "…from Southfront [ Editor’s note: We have a peek at Erdogan’s strategy here. He is paying the SNA to cause as much disruption as possible with modest casualties, which he can blame on “terrorist Kurds”. And this also holds up getting the joint patrols deployed, as they don’t want to go into areas that have not been cleared. It also buys more time for the Americans to reoccupy areas they just withdrew from, including northeast Syria. They are setting up observation posts. We had last night the SDF telling us that the US is continuing to supply them. So much for Trump’s “withdrawal”. On the flip side we see the SDF helping the SAA avoid direct confrontation with the Turks and SNA, letting the SDF do the clearing, and then the SAA moving forces in to hold the areas afterwards. This is a good shared responsibility approach, where hopefully both sides will build trust while the SDF Kurds dance with the US and Syria at the same time.

According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the liberated villages are Dawdiyah, al-Sa’id, Riyhana, al-Suwaydiyah, Kanbhr, Abush, Umm Sh’ayfah and Faysaliyah. “The Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured the eight villages after losing them during clashes with the [Syrian] National Army [SNA] last month,” the SOHR’s report reads. While the SDF continues to recapture territory from Turkish-backed militants, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) is working to fortify these newly-liberated areas. Earlier, the SAA deployed large reinforcements, including howitzers, rocket launchers and battle tanks, in the Abu Rasin. The town, which is located south of Ras al-Ayn, was captured by the SDF a few days ago. Loading... EDITORIAL DISCLOSURE All content herein is owned by author exclusively.

    "articleText": "Geopolitics in Middle East: What is the intention of Israel? by Enkidu Gilgamesh CONTENT Fight for & blackmail with water! The role of the Druze! Expecting Alawite refugees! Getting and supporting Jihadists only! Water, from Golan to Kurdistan! Strategy of decades shattered! Conceptual mistakes of Zionism! Declaring bankruptcy! Find love, peace and happiness in Palestine . 1. Fight for & blackmail with water! The masterpiece of Zionist strategists is their recognition of the geostrategic importance of Kurdistan. In an alliance with Kurdistan, they promised themselves and the politicians the long term survival and expansion of their own entity. Finally also Israel needs to secure the supply of fuel for energy and foremost of water, to become a fully grown state. Looking at the following dispute between Israel and Jordan about land and water, anyone can see the importance of water for this region. Wars are fought for water and countries are blackmailed with water. Just imagine how it would be if Israel could use the water reserves of a Greater-Kurdistan! Israel threatens to cut off water to Jordan if terminates land lease Sat Oct 26, 2019 09:12AM https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/10/26/609595/Israel-Jordan-King-Abdullah-II-water-deal-Ariel-Sharon “Gilad Sharon, the son of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, warned in an article he penned for the Israeli Ynet news website that Jordanians “will feel the thirst” if Amman proceeds with the king’s decision to end the lease, which was agreed under a bilateral peace deal signed almost a quarter of a century ago.“ “According to the peace treaty inked by Jordan and Israel on October 26, 1994, the two territories of Baqoura (Naharayim) and Ghamr (Zofar) were leased to Israel for a 25-year renewable period. Under the agreement, the lease is automatically renewable unless either side gives a year’s notice to terminate it. The deal allowed the Tel Aviv regime and Israeli farmers to use the two areas in the fertile Jordan Valley— which are recognized Jordanian territory. In exchange, Israel agreed to supply Jordan, which is suffering from a severe water crisis, with 45 million cubic meters of water every year. In recent years, the number has increased to around 55 million cubic meters. In October 2018, King Abdullah II said Amman has already notified Israel that it will not extend the lease, stressing that the two border areas “are Jordanian land and will remain” part of the Arab country.“ . 2. The role of the Druze! For Israel foremost the Druze should not be harmed during the Jihadist attack on Syria, as the Druze in Israel are well established and also the leader of the Lebanese Druze Walid Jublatt was onboard of the united enemies against Syria. We should be aware that the Druze are of Kurdish origin and among themselves they still speak their native Kurdish dialect. The Druze should be considered more as Kurdish tribes, because they are organized like the other Kurdish communities despite also being Alawite, Sunni, Christian, Jewish or other confession. So they fit into a Pan-Kurdish ideology and harmonize with the Greater-Israel and Imperial-USA strategies. THE PERSIAN ORIGIN OF THE DRUZES https://www.sacred-texts.com/asia/odpr/odpr08.htm “The leading families among the Druzes have been throughout their history either of full Kurdish and Persian origin or of Persianized and ‘Irāqized Arab origin. That is, they have been either Kurdish and Persian families or tribes from the Arabian peninsula who, before their advent into the Lebanon, sojourned for many generations in Mesopotamia where they became fully indoctrinated with the ‘Alid ideas and subjected to Gnostic and Manichaean influences.“ Syria Loses Its Former Ally in Lebanon, Druze Leader Walid Jumblatt Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, January/February 2001, Pages 35-36 Letter From the Levant By Sami Moubayed https://www.wrmea.org/001-january-february/syria-loses-its-former-ally-in-lebanon-druze-leader-walid-jumblatt.html “For more than 20 years, therefore, Jumblatt played by the rules of the game—Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad’s game—submitting to the beck and call of the Syrian leadership, building connections in Damascus, and thereby increasing his legitimacy in Beirut.“ “In November 2000, however, tired of playing the lackey, and longing for a new role in regional affairs, Jumblatt suddenly decided to switch sides and move into Lebanon’s emerging anti-Syrian coalition. In a flash, he fell from grace in Damascus—but, contrary to Syrian expectations, his popularity in Lebanon has skyrocketed.“ The Druze could be integrated into a federation under the leadership of Israel, if Syria fell apart and Israel could win the support of all Druze by intervening for their protection! That was at least the golden way for the Israeli strategists concerning the Druze. To promote this solution the Jihadist rebels act accordingly. They give the stick and Israel offers the carrot. 🙂 Don’t bruise the Druze Israel has warned Syrian rebels to steer clear of one particular minority Jun 20th 2015 | JERUSALEM https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2015/06/20/dont-bruise-the-druze “As the remnants of the Syrian army—backed by Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hizbullah—have lost ground, Islamic State (IS) has drawn near the main Druze population on the Jebel Druze mountain range. (Elsewhere IS has lost ground to Kurdish forces, including a key border crossing and supply route at Tel Abyad on Syria’s border with Turkey.) Druze villages on the Syrian part of the Golan have also been coming under fire from rebel groups including Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. These threats are fraying the Druze’s traditional loyalty to the government, and they have appealed to their cousins in Israel for help.“ “An Israeli deputy minister, Ayoob Kara, himself a Druze, says that “for the first time Syrian Druze have been making direct contact.” Officially Israeli policy remains strictly non-interventionist but the government has discreetly promised the local Druze leaders that it will not stand aside if their Syrian brothers come under attack.“ “On June 16th the normally taciturn IDF chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Gadi Eizenkot, said that “Israel will prevent a massacre of refugees on its border with Syria.” The next day, as rebels advanced on the Syrian Druze village of Hader, just a mile from the border, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, said Israel was “closely monitoring” the Druze situation and had ordered “all necessary measures”. The army’s plans may include setting up an emergency field hospital in no-man’s-land on the border. And if thousands of Druze refugees stream towards the frontier, Israel may be the first of Syria’s neighbours to establish a buffer-zone with it.“ . 3. Expecting Alawite refugees! Israel expected a secular and liberal Kurdistan to be formed and intended to protect all Kurds and similar groups to show its good intentions. In that context it should also be clear that a big part of the Kurds are of Alawite confession. By that connection also the Syrian Arab Alawites could be brought under the protective Israeli umbrella. Maybe the biggest miscalculation of US and Israeli war strategists was that they considered the Alawites as the main supportive pillar of the Syrian government, by ignoring the reality of most Syrian Christian and Sunni are secular and fervent nationalists and would never submit to Salafism or Muslim Brotherhood. The Israeli and US strategists and politicians wanted to believe their own lies and were surprised by the strong structure of Syrian society and state administration. So they applied the brutal strategy of shock an awe, to cause extreme fear particularly among the Alawites, make them run for their lives and open the Israeli borders for them as refugees. The role of the shocker was played by the Jihadists, who tortured and massacred many civilians and published their crimes on all (a)social networks. I won’t show examples here. Readers who are not aware and want to look for evidence may may find it on other sources like Twitter. Shock and Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_and_awe “Shock and awe (technically known as rapid dominance) is a tactic based on the use of overwhelming power and spectacular displays of force to paralyze the enemy’s perception of the battlefield and destroy their will to fight.“ The Psychological Warfare in ISIS’s military strategy http://theiranproject.com/blog/2015/09/07/the-psychological-warfare-in-isiss-military-strategy/ “The ISIS group to intimidate and terrorize its adversaries uses a set of ways which include cold-blooded mass killings, suicidal operations in public places, airing propaganda videos of beheading the victims and street explosions.“ “ISIS has used all of these tactics as part of its psychological warfare campaign in Syria and Iraq.“ “Moreover, ISIS posts ferocious propaganda videos online, videos containing scenes of beheading the victims, massive killings as well as other videos depicting the group’s parades in front of their defeated opponent forces and people of the cities which the group claims as part of its realm of caliphate.“ “ISIS follows a curiously and precisely planned policy concerning creating an air of intimidation. The group chooses what it posts on such websites as YouTube and Twitter very meticulously. The videos and pictures posted online are precisely chosen, aiming to leave a deep impact on the targets’ minds, and in the same time they are intended to scare the opposing sides and draw the other extremist and terrorist groups’ affirmative responses and admirations.“ Reading following quotes we also learn how deeply Benny Gantz, the fake opponent to Netanyahu was involved into the war against Syria and Syrian people. Israel prepared to take in Syrian refugees, chief of staff says JANUARY 10, 2012 | 11:51 AM https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/01/israel-syria-refugees.html “Benny Gantz, Israel’s chief of staff, briefed the Knesset’s Defense and Foreign Affairs committee on the range of challenges facing Israel, among them the ongoing violent upheaval in Syria, its northern neighbor.“ “Israeli officials have said for many weeks that Assad’s rule is unlikely to survive. How this may unfold is hard to predict. But Gantz noted Israel may find members of the Assad family’s Alawite religious sect, which makes up a little more than 10% of Syria’s population, fleeing feared retribution.“ ““The day Assad’s regime falls, it will be expected to hurt the Alawite sect,” he said. “We are preparing to take in Alawite refugees on the Golan Heights.”“ “Assad’s downfall “will widen the cracks of the civil war already raging in Syria, and Alawites will flee in all directions for fear of Sunni reprisal for their many years of supporting the Assad regime,” Rabi (Uzi Rabi, head of Middle East studies at Tel Aviv University) said, noting that in this context, Syrians seeking refuge in Israel was not an impossible scenario.“ Here we also get a hint that Israel was behind the terror attacks in Iran. IDF preparing to take in Syrian refugees Army Chief Gantz says President Assad’s fall to hurt Alawite sect, IDF preparing to absorb Syrian refugees on Golan Heights Moran Azulaiy|Last update: 01.10.12 , 14:40 https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4173814,00.html “The IDF is preparing for a possible flood of Syrian refugees following the potential fall of President Bashar Assad, Chief of Staff Benny Gantz said Tuesday.“ “Speaking at the Knesset’s Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, the army chief said that members of Assad’s Alawite sect are expected to seek shelter in Israel should the Syrian leader, an Alawite himself, be removed from power.“ “The day the Assad regime falls, this is expected to hurt the Alawite sect,” Army Chief Gantz said. “We are preparing to take in Alawite refugees on the Golan Heights.“ “Turning his attention to Iran, the army chief said that 2012 is expected to be a “critical year in the meeting place between ongoing nuclear efforts, the domestic changes in Iran’s leadership, increasing pressure from the international community, and things that are happening there unnaturally.”“ “Meanwhile, President Assad delivered a two-hour speech Monday, charging that foreign elements are aiming to topple his rule.“ IDF Chief: Israel Ready to Absorb Some Syria Refugees Once Assad Falls Benny Gantz says expects Bashar Assad’s regime to collapse in near future and issue a blow to the Alawite community in Syria; Gantz: Assad is not like Gadhafi, he won’t fight till last bullet. Jonathan Lis, Haaretz Correspondent, Jan 10, 2012 2:31 PM https://www.haaretz.com/1.5162461 “Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Benny Gantz said Tuesday that Israel is preparing to absorb Alawite refugees once Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime collapses, which he expects to happen in the coming months.“ ““Assad cannot continue holding on to power and his downfall is expected to cause a crack in the radical axis,” Gantz said.“ ““Assad is not the same type as [Former Libyan leader Muammar] Gahdafi, who fights until the last bullet down in the sewer. The day that the Syrian regime will fall, it will issue a blow to the Alawites, and we are preparing to absorb those refugees.”“ . 4. Getting and supporting Jihadists only! Israel allowed the Al-Nusra Front to torture and kill Christian, Alawite, Sunni and other Syrians but not touch the Druze! But the Syrian government did not fall withing weeks, also not months and years. No Alawite, Druze or Christian Syrians sought refuge in Israel, but the Israeli alliance with and support for the Jihadists grew obviously. Israeli air force became the factual Jihadist air force. Israeli Military Admits to Supporting Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ac3_1440060540 “We’ve assisted them under two conditions“, Ya’alon said of the Israeli medical aid to the Syrian rebels, some of whom are presumably fighting with al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad. “That they don’t get too close to the border, and that they don’t touch the Druze.“ Israel Just Admitted Arming anti-Assad Syrian Rebels. Big Mistake For the first time on the record, a senior official confirmed Israel’s secret unconventional war in Syria, aimed at preventing Iranian encroachment. But what did Israel gain from exposing its ‘anti-intervention’ lie after so many years of denial? Daniel J. Levy, Feb 03, 2019 2:18 PM https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-israel-just-admitted-arming-anti-assad-syrian-rebels-big-mistake-1.6894850 “In his final days as the Israel Defense Forces’ Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot confirmed, on the record, that Israel had directly supported anti-Assad Syrian rebel factions in the Golan Heights by arming them. This revelation marks a direct break from Israel’s previous media policy on such matters. Until now, Israel has insisted it has only provided humanitarian aid to civilians (through field hospitals on the Golan Heights and in permanent healthcare facilities in northern Israel), and has consistently denied or refused to comment on any other assistance.“ What belongs together, comes together! Zionism and Wahabism united for oil, gas, water, soil and airspace. Al-Qaeda, Saudi Arabia and Israel February 4, 2015, By Robert Parry https://consortiumnews.com/2015/02/04/al-qaeda-saudi-arabia-and-israel/ “Further complicating the predicament for Saudi Arabia is that, more recently, Saudi and other Persian Gulf oil sheikdoms have been identified as backers of Sunni militants fighting in Syria to overthrow the largely secular regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The major rebel force benefiting from this support is al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria.“ “And, like the Saudis, the Israelis have sided with the Sunni militants in Syria because the Israelis share the Saudi view that Iran and the so-called “Shiite crescent” reaching from Tehran and Baghdad to Damascus and Beirut is the greatest threat to their interests in the Middle East. That shared concern has pushed Israel and Saudi Arabia into a de facto alliance, though the collaboration between Jerusalem and Riyadh has been mostly kept out of the public eye. Still, it has occasionally peeked out from under the covers as the two governments deploy their complementary assets Saudi oil and money and Israeli political and media clout in areas where they have mutual interests.“ “In recent years, these historic enemies have cooperated in their joint disdain for the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt (which was overthrown in 2013), in seeking the ouster of the Assad regime in Syria, and in pressing for a more hostile U.S. posture toward Iran.“ . 5. Water, from Golan to Kurdistan! Israel occupies the Golan Heights since 1967, in addition to military needs, to guarantee its own water supply. The role of the Golan Heights is fulfilled by Kurdistan for the whole region! This should show every observer the meaning of Kurdistan for the Zionist expansion strategy. Kurdistan will build only the launch pad for a much wider escalation of regional and global economic and military war! The liquidation of the Republic of Syria could have solved the question about the Golan Heights in favor of Israel. Although this daydream has been disploded, Mr. Netanyahu could not stop to openly pronounce it. In his desperation he asked Mr. Trump, who is the wrong contact, as he is not the owner of the land. Syria will take its territory sooner or later! NETANYAHU TO TRUMP: RECOGNIZE GOLAN HEIGHTS AS PART OF ISRAEL BY TOVAH LAZAROFF FEBRUARY 16, 2017 03:14 http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-to-Trump-Recognize-Golan-Heights-as-part-of-Israel-481676 “The United States and the international community have never recognized Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights.“ Who is ignoring the reality? 🙂 Since 2015 Russia and Iran were fully engaged in Syria and the Syrian Arab Army was already beating all Jihadist factions and collecting them in smaller chunks. Israel hoped to use the Jihadist threat and Syrian weakness as an apology to annex the Golan heights for ever. The answer of UN came clear and harsh. Israeli hold on Golan ‘null and void,’ UN Security Council says after Netanyahu vows plateau will ‘forever’ remain under Israeli control, world body expresses ‘deep concern’ By AFP and TOI STAFF 26 April 2016, 10:37 pm 16 https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-hold-on-golan-null-and-void-un-security-council-says/ “The UN Security Council on Tuesday rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s assertion that the annexed Golan Heights would “forever” remain under Israeli control and expressed concern over his statements.“ “Liu recalled a 1981 resolution which states that Israel’s “decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights was null and void and without any international legal effect.”” “Israel’s Foreign Ministry shot back at the Security Council’s statement, saying it was “ignoring the reality” in Syria.“ ““Who is Israel expected to negotiate with on the future of the Golan Heights? Islamic State? Al-Qaeda? Hezbollah? The Iranian and Syrian forces who massacred hundreds of thousands of people?” the statement said.“ This article of Intercept substantiates the planning and implementation of the whole Golan Heights annexation beginning with a 40 km “security zone” in Syria! ISRAEL’S “SAFE ZONE” IS CREEPING FARTHER INTO SYRIA January 23 2018, 3:27 p.m. https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/ Nour Samaha “ISRAEL IS EXPANDING its influence and control deeper into opposition-held southern Syria, according to multiple sources in the area. After failed attempts to ensure its interests were safeguarded by the major players in the war next door, Israel is pushing to implement the second phase of its “safe-zone” project — an attempt to expand a buffer ranging out from the occupied Golan Heights deeper into the southern Syrian provinces of Quneitra and Daraa. The safe zone expansion marks a move toward deeper Israeli involvement in Syria’s civil war.“ “The Intercept learned the outlines of the safe-zone expansion plan through a monthslong investigation relying on information from a variety of sources, including Syrian opposition activists on the ground in the south, Syrian opposition figures based in Jordan, Syrian government sources, and an Israeli-American NGO directly involved in the safe-zone project.“ “The safe zone appears intended to keep the Syrian army and its Iranian and Lebanese allies as far away from Israel’s border as possible, as well as solidify Israel’s control over the occupied Golan Heights. Israel seized the Golan from Syria in 1967’s Six-Day War. Expanding a buffer zone would likely make any negotiations over the return of the Syrian territory more difficult in the future, because the Golan Heights will be surrounded on both sides by areas with significant Israeli influence.“ “Over the last two years, Israel started building out the first phase of a safe zone in southern Syria. The project enabled the Israeli army, through humanitarian organizations and military personnel, to gain access to opposition-held areas in return for supplying aid, medical treatment inside Israel, and basic goods.“ “According to sources, the second phase, which is currently underway, includes, among other things, the establishment of a 40-kilometer, Israeli-monitored buffer beyond the Golan Heights, a Syrian border police force armed and trained by Israel, and greater involvement in civil administration in opposition-controlled areas in two southern provinces. The expansion of the project also involves military aid to a wider array of opposition factions in both Quneitra and Daraa. The wider buffer zone also sees partnerships being built up with Syrian opposition leaders, civil society leaders, NGOs, and health officials on the ground to work on joint educational, health, and agricultural projects.“ . 6. Strategy of decades shattered! Factually all expansionist Zionist decades-strategies have shattered at the hard rock of Syria. Among many other the most famous are: “Der Judenstaat” of Theodor Herzl The Yinon Plan A Clean Break Project for a Greater Middle East However, the Zionist society in Israel, the USA and elsewhere seems to be unable to disempower and replace the failed leadership, personified in Benjamin Netanyahu. The administration and the people are in a status of delirium, not having any alternative ideas and leaders. There is no other strategy and no political party outside of the Zionist soup. As if they gambled on one card and lost, would now be totally bankrupt and standing at a wall. This WALL has a name, it is the Hezbollah. This small feared opponent has proven its potency already in 2000 and 2006 in Lebanon and now in Syria it multiplied its manpower, equipment and technical sophistication. Hezbollah existed only in South-Lebanon, now it is in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The Israeli police and jurisdiction and army, which proves its “bravery” against Palestinian children, youth and leg-amputated men, could fulfill the miracle of disempowerment of the Netanyahu-Gang, what should not be too difficult, as the corruption of Netanyahu is legendary.

Else, the economic, military and political future for them looks gloomy. By the way, the Samson-Option is NOT a SOLUTION but only a dumb idea of an endtime sect! THE SAMSON OPTION: WILL ISRAEL NUKE GERMANY AND IRAN? https://thecross-roads.org/race-culture-nation/113-the-samson-option-will-israel-nuke-germany-and-iran . 7. Conceptual mistakes of Zionism! I will tell you a small fake story of fake-history. 🙂 Imagine in about 5.000 years, when the world has changed, most knowledge is lost and some people on a distant land, with identity and inferiority complex would find a book named “The Hobbit” and think it was about them. Based on that they would conduct archaeological research for their “lost land” and would claim it back from the “occupiers“. This land would be Ireland. Geography and the people would be different and it would not be an island anymore but the name would be the same. To reclaim the land, they would form a powerful army, invade Ireland, knock on the doors of the native Irish people, show the book and offer them peace by leaving Hobbitland or face war of extinction and ethnic cleansing. Some people of Ireland would show their historic documents and other evidence of tradition, but the Hobbits would only believe in their book and would expect from all people to accept their claim on “their” legendary “homeland“. After conquering a big chunk of Ireland, the Hobbits would realize that this distant land does not offer enough resources for living. So their priests would “reread and reinterpret the message of the book” and claim whole historic Europe as Hobbitland. First shocked and overwhelmed by the fierce attack of the Hobbits, the people of Ireland would reorganize, become more military and resist. Also all the other people would do the same and prepare for the inevitable conflict with the Hobbits. Using this short story, I want to show how dangerous it is to play history and legend games based on pseudo-historic books. Even if the book would be an authentic historic chronicle, it would not grant the right to rewind and replay history with real bloodshed, death and destruction. The concept of Zionism was wrong and bad from its beginning, similar to other gruesome, racist and nationalistic ideologies in Europe. There is no ideal to seek, no peaceful solution to find and no statehood to build on it. It is a concept of perpetual war, perpetual terror, perpetual fear and perpetual disaster. I mean every person, who can afford it, should live wherever he/she likes based on his/her preference and belief. So if people of Jewish faith love to live in Palestine, they should do that. But they should not try to legitimize stealing land and killing native people by “interpreting” their book and inventing the “hidden message of their God“. Such criminal activities damage also the Jewish faith. Dear people of Israel, the psychological reason for wanting to be “selected” lies in deeply felt inferiority complex. You just need to become normal people, without stigmata. For that you should stop cultivating stigmata and creating new ones! It is time to wake up from playing fake history “Games of Thrones”. The geographical role of Palestine is to be part of the coastal land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is not a bad place but also not indispensable and strategically unsuitable to house the administrative center of a regional or global empire. Big empires need an according geography. The reason why China, India and Russia are so big is their geography, not an ideology. Even the imperial ideologies are build on the suiting geography, not otherwise. Palestine was never, is not and will never be an imperial center. Don’t waste your time and life for a lost case. To be more honest to you, a Zionist dominance in the region does not actually exist, whatever the politicians may propagate. All military and economic power of Israel is fake, build on 10 billions of yearly subventions by the USA and European Union. Also a “Zionist control on America“, as claimed by Prime Ministers of Israel like Ariel Sharon, Benjamin Netanyahu or others is fake and fraudulent. The mixing and overstretching the interests of Israel and USA damaged both and worsened the development in the Middle East. When the focus of USA has to change, the administration will throw the Israel Lobby away like a hot potato. It is now foreseeable that global US dominance will end within the current decade and Europe or any other big country will not take the role of the USA to feed fake Zionist dreams. Even strategically it would be wrong for Russia or China to invest in Israel. If China wanted to build one of the big container harbors as part of its new silk roads, there are many more suitable places at the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. . 8. Declaring the bankruptcy! Did Netanyahu only scare the people of Israel with lies? Is Netanyahu the bad boy who lied many times about the wolf would be attacking the sheep and now the wolf is actually there, but no one believes him? If he was a liar or all his activities during the last decades were ill and wrong and if he was corrupt, why should the people of Israel trust him further and blow more billions into his corrupt network? If he was lying until now, he is still doing the same, but more exponentially and out of desperation. Iran is well aware, that the time is ticking against Netanyahu and Zionism at all. Iran is well aware, that it doesn’t need to attack, it is enough just to be able to defend itself, if attacked! Iran is well ware, that Zionism is imploding, resisting it is enough! So the Iranian threat cannot grow exponentially by weeks and months! What really occurring is the implosion of the corrupt network of Netanyahu and Zionism in general. Netanyahu is declaring that he is at the end of his political career! Israel needs ‘many billions immediately’ to fight Iranian threat: Netanyahu By News Desk -2019-10-05 https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/israel-needs-many-billions-immediately-to-fight-iranian-threat-netanyahu/ “Israel must inject billions of shekels into its defence budget to fight a growing threat from Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the newly sworn-in Knesset as he upped the ante in his struggle for a unity government and the future of his prime ministership.“ “Speaking to lawmakers on Thursday, Netanyahu said that defence spending must increase by “many billions immediately and then many billions every year”.“ “According to Netanyahu, the rationale behind this is the growing strength of Iran: “We are facing an enormous security challenge, which only intensifies from week to week. It increased profoundly in the last month or two, and, in particular, in the last few weeks. This isn’t spin, it’s not a whim, this is not ‘Netanyahu trying to scare us’”.“ Even the banksters may stop feeding Zionism as a very bad investment. How dire would that look without the billions of Dollars and Euros paid every year by USA and EU? Why are they paying at all? They don’t get anything back except terror and chaos.

Find love, peace and happiness in Palestine! Dear people of Israel, look around, your neighbors are suffering, because of your ill behaviors since 1860, believing, betraying, stealing, killing because of an ill ideology. Your neighbors are Palestinian Jews, Christians, Muslims and others. They are humans like you, they have children to feed and educate, people with dreams of love and happiness. Get aware of them and become normal Palestinians like them. Find peace and love in Palestine, you won’t find that anywhere else on Earth. People of Israel, please give up the fake dreams, fake security, fake politics, fake leaders, fake power and come down to reality on the ground to find peace, love, security, humanity and prosperity. IMHO the only real solution is to give up Zionism, fake-religious Fanatism, Racism and Nationalism, instead join with all the people of Levant, build an administrative and economic federation under the leadership of Syria. Forget historic, fake-historic, religious or fantasy books. Forget the current and former wars. Make a restart based on all available options of diplomacy and economic cooperation. Forming a federation with Palestine, Lebanon, Syrian and Jordan will fulfill all dreams for all, about oil, gas and water, without fighting. —- —- —- From the same series, please check also following parts: What is the intention of the USA?

    "articleText": "On October 31, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) recaptured the villages of Abu Rasin, al-Manakh, al-Sibatiyah, Rajlah al-Hamrah and al-Qasimiyah from Turkish-backed militants in northeastern Syria. Turkish-backed militant groups, backed up by the Turkish Army, seized these villages and several others on October 30. However, they appeared to be unable to keep control of all of them without a constant direct support from the Turkish Army. Despite this, the military situation in the area remains tense and Turkish-led forces continue attempts to expand their zone of control. These attacks are likely attempts to exploit the existing contradictions between the SDF and the Syrian Army. On October 30, the Syrian Defense Ministry released an official statement calling on SDF members to join the ranks of the army to counter the Turkish offensive and restore Syrian territorial integrity. The defense ministry also proposed SDF members to settle their legal situation, even those wanted for security reasons. The Syrian Interior Ministry released a similar statement, welcoming personnel of the SDF’s security forces, known as Asayish, into its ranks. These statements faced a fierce resistance among the SDF leadership that claimed that it will not accept any deal that would not “recognize and preserve” the group’s “privacy and structure.” Mazloum Abdi, commander-in-chief of the SDF, claimed that these offers are “unwelcomed,” calling on Damascus to grant the SDF with a special status. This behavior is apparently linked with actions of US forces that have recently increased their activity in northern Syria. A US military column was recently spotted in the village of Sreen, south of Kobani. Most likely, these actions are aimed at rescuing the crumbling US influence in the countryside of Raqqah, additionally to the already occupied oil fields in Deir Ezzor. Loading...

    "articleText": "The United States is to keep forces at the oil fields in Syria despite the troops’ withdrawal from the north of the country. The formal justification of the move is the need to “deny ISIS access” to the oil fields. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that the US military is already “taking some actions” to strengthen and reinforce their position in Deir Ezzor. This, Esper said, will include “some mechanized forces”. US military convoys already started entering Syria from Iraq and moving towards the US-controlled oil fields on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. The Pentagon provided few details regarding numbers of troops and equipment that will remain in the area. Media reports speculate that around 500 personnel reinforced with dozens of pieces of military equipment will be stationed there. For example, Newsweek reported that the US is seeking to deploy a half of an US Army armored brigade combat team battalion that includes as many as 30 Abrams battle tanks to the oil fields. The US is also going to keep its military garrison in the al-Tanf area, on the Damascus Baghdad highway, where about 150-200 troops remain. The version of the troops’ withdrawal from Syria that the media is trying to sell its audience says that the US is leaving the country. In reality, the US actions look more like re-deployment than withdrawal. Firstly, the withdrawal of “a majority of 1,000 troops” is hardly possible if, at the same time, 650-700 troops are to remain in the Deir Ezzor oil fields and al-Tanf. Secondly, the Trump administration, including the Defense Secretary, said that it was moving troops out of northern Syria, but not that they would be leaving the country. Trump himself described the withdrawal from Syria as a “process”. Thirdly, the US military convoys which left northern Syria during the active phase of Turkey’s Operation Peace Spring for western Iraq are now returning. Dozens of US military vehicles accompanied by fuel tankers entered Syria on October 26 and 27 alone. US forces also remained deployed at the Qasrak base on the Tell Tamr-Qamishli highway. Therefore, in the best case the US contingent is being reduced, while the rest of the forces just change their deployment area. The stance of Iraq, which at the highest level rejected the long-term presence of the US troops withdrawing from Syria to western Iraq, also played its own role. Some experts initially suggested that Washington could keep forces on the Iraqi side of the border to project military power to Syria while keeping the troop withdrawal promise at the same time. However, this plan caused too much resistance from the Iraqi government, which is already in much closer relations with Iran than the US has ever wanted. Another factor is money. The control of a part of Syrian oil does not impact the US economy in general. However, it does open particular prospects for the US campaign in the region and gives the Trump administration additional leverages of pressure on Syria and its allies. Before 2011, Syria had a lucrative oil industry, pumping about 400,000 barrels a day and having 2.5 billion barrels of reserves. The ensuing war and wide-scale Western sanctions devastated the country’s economy, cutting production by around 90% and forcing the Assad government to rely heavily on foreign imports of oil, mainly from Iran. The known oil reserves are mainly in the eastern part of the country near its border with Iraq and along the Euphrates River. The largest and most mature fields are the Omar and Jbessa fields, which reportedly had production capacities of 100,000 and 200,000 barrels a day, respectively, in 2010. This is the area where the US is planning to keep its military presence. It is estimated that around 75% of Syrian oil reserves are under the direct or indirect control of the US. A number of smaller fields are located in the center of the country, which is controlled by the Syrian Army, and in the country’s northeast, which is now under the joint control of the Syrian Army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). When the SDF and the US-led coalition seized the fields, the revenue from smuggling of Syrian oil was estimated at around $10 million a month with the price of around $30 per barrel. However, thanks to assistance from companies affiliated with US intelligence agencies and private military companies the oil output and thus revenue grew significantly. According to an October 26 report by the Russian Defense Ministry, the US military and private military contractors are now actively involved in protecting and managing oil smuggling in eastern Syria. The oil production itself is carried out using equipment provided by Western corporations bypassing all US sanctions. The oil exportation is implemented by the US-controlled company «Sedkab», created under the so-called Autonomous Administration of Eastern Syria, a political body created by the SDF, when US troops were deployed in northern Syria. The income from the smuggling goes through brokerage companies interacting with various accounts of US private military companies and US intelligence agencies. The Russian side says that the barrel cost of smuggled Syrian oil is $38 and estimates a monthly revenue for the US “business” involved in the operation of over $30 million. The business interests of US agencies and entities involved in the operation offer more reasons for the US presence in the area. It can be expected that if the situation in this part of Syria remains unchanged, the Trump administration will indeed go forward with its withdrawal “process” and more and more US troops will be replaced by US-linked private military contractors. Meanwhile US agencies and private military corporations will use revenue from the oil smuggling for further operations across the Middle East. Loading...

    "description": "Gordon Duff - I once spent several weeks hunting Americans in South Vietnam who had commanded a Viet Cong unit, the Q84 company.",
    "articleText": "by Gordon Duff, VT Sr. Editor, … with New Eastern Outlook, Moscow, 1816 – First published … November 11, 2019 – [ Editor’s Note: This is another barnburner from Gordon. Fasten your seatbelts, as this is going to be a more than one read piece, as it was for me before I could do this introduction. One teaser – this is the first time he has ever published that he was assigned at one time to hunt Americans who had gone over to the Viet Cong. It is longer than usual, but also concise, a necessary skill he developed when writing reports for busy people who wanted you to get out your points quickly, which VT readers are well acquainted with in his writing style. Here is one front end example. “Governments are controlled to control resources, to manipulate markets through manufactured needs and shortages, through currencies, through militarization, and humanity is little but fodder, tolerated only so long as it serves these efforts.” There are a lot of Americans who, at first blush, might consider this an unpatriotic statement, and others who say that is not correct. One of the reasons VT has survived is that there are a lot of patriotic people on the inside who like what we do, who feel the public has a right to know, but the insiders are not in a position to do it. We do it because we can, and business does not look to be slowing down any time soon. “They” will continue to do what they do as long as they can get away with it. That’s how it has always worked and probably always will… Jim W. Dean ] Ziggy with bin Laden, doing their early “Game of Thrones” thing. – First published … November 01, 2019 – Before we begin, for those who are not intelligence specialists, these axioms must be, if not learned, at least introduced. Behind the curtain exists a Deep State, a world super-government that will minimally influence and in most cases control national governments. Governments are controlled to control resources, to manipulate markets through manufactured needs and shortages, through currencies, though militarization and humanity is little but fodder, tolerated only so long as it serves these efforts. If two million are killed in Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan, the Deep State only counts its profits. The dead mean nothing. Governments are fragile. Elections can be rigged, politicians purchased for a paltry sum and in a world where “everyone has a price,” anyone worth purchasing has been purchased. Thus, every demonstration can be controlled or “turned” in some way; every government can be destabilized; and today, with the power of corrupt social media monoliths and Google Corporation, a massive psychological war begins not only on nations but individuals, all individuals, who are subject to the most dangerous addiction of all, electronic devices. After so many years, the most recent setup Middle East wars should be examined with skepticism and those involved assumed to be employees of Western intelligence agencies, faker than fake. With the dramatic and somewhat manic and incoherent announcement by American President Donald Trump of the killing of “chief head chopper” and “super-villain,” Baghdadi, alleged head of ISIS or ISIL or Daesh, an analyst or intelligence specialist might well drown in skepticism or simply quit from frustration. There are a thousand reasons why the Baghdadi killing is fake, but top of the list is this one — there are no ISIS fighters, no facilities, no groups friendly to ISIS within hundreds of miles from where he was allegedly chased down by a dog. Those of us who know how the US works too well, those who had worked on similar projects, are fearful for different reasons. I once spent several weeks hunting Americans in South Vietnam, so very long ago, who had commanded a Viet Cong unit, the Q84 company. It seems more than a few Americans joined the Viet Cong, not pilots mind you, but “tip of the spear” special operations troops. Then again, half a century later and that story is forgotten. It may well be classified still; I can wait and find out, I guess. You don’t need to be an Intel analyst to tell which one is real Then, of course, we will mention the bin Laden story in the most cursory manner. Reported dead on December 3, 2001, by even Fox News, after denying any complicity in the 9/11 terror attacks, he rose from the grave 6 inches shorter and with entirely different facial features. He had a long career of audio recordings carefully timed to distract audiences from endless American scandals, massive corruption, a badly botched hurricane recovery effort – a story too long to get into now, but fascinating all the same. Then back to Baghdadi and Trump’s performance, which in itself was a humiliation for Americans – or at least literate and mentally stable Americans, a group that still exists despite efforts by American media to prove otherwise. The entire idea is absurd according to Major General Igor Konashenkov of Russia’s Defense Ministry who initially reported that the alleged raid was not seen by Russia’s S400 radars, which everyone knows see everything, even the smallest drone a few feet off the ground. That report was scrubbed by Google and Facebook but exists still on Tass. “Russia’s defense ministry has no reliable information about an operation by US forces in the Turkey-controlled part of the Idlib de-escalation zone aimed at another extermination of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” he said. He said that the fact that the number of those who describe their participation in al-Baghdadi’s extermination and share contradictory details of the operation make one doubt that such an operation ever took place. “We know nothing about any assistance to the flight of US aircraft to the Idlib de-escalation zone’s airspace in the course of this operation,” Konashenkov said. Americans and others in the West won’t have this information – Google and Facebook delisted it and any publications that carried this language – but it exists just the same. Yet another report about the extermination of al-Baghdadi can hardly influence the situation in Syria, Konashenkov said. “After Islamic State was ultimately defeated by the Syrian government army with support of the Russia aerospace forces in early 2018, yet another ‘death’ of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi will have no impact either on the situation in Syria or on the actions of terrorists staying in Idlib,” he said. No airstrikes by US forces reported from Syria’s Idlib No airstrikes by the US air force or by the US-led coalition have been reported from Syria’s Idlib de-escalation zone in recent days, Konashenkov noted. “No airstrikes by either US air forces of the so-called international coalition have been registered in the Idlib de-escalation zone on Saturday and over the recent days,” Konashenkov said. Apart from that, the Russian defense ministry said it doubted that al-Baghdadi could be hiding in a territory controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra (outlawed in Russia as a terrorist organization) in Idlib. “This organization has always unhesitatingly killed Islamic State fighters on the spot as key rivals for power in Syria. Bearing this in mind, the US or other participants in the operation should at least provide direct evidence that the former Islamic State leader had been safely staying on a territory controlled by the ‘Syrian Al Qaeda (also outlawed in Russia),” he added. You can’t talk about ISIS without taking a cursory look at the White Helmets. According to the Russian government, this organization – an NGO which isn’t an NGO, as it gets its endless millions from NATO – fakes videos of alleged atrocities and has itself killed hundreds, even thousands. The evidence is overwhelming, and has been presented time and time again – science, video analysis, witness statements and eventually 40 White Helmets themselves who told the world court that they were hired as actors to dupe the media. It isn’t just the White Helmets. You have the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights or several fake medical groups that report each attack on a terrorist operation center as the “barrel bombing” of an orphanage or hospital. However, it is necessary that we return to the background. After years of reports of ISIS operating with aid from the US and other nations delisted and censored, the truth has become a rare commodity. While in Syria, I reviewed statements made by captured ISIS employees in the custody of the Syrian Justice Ministry. Syria was holding these people for a period of time, debriefing them and resettling them with their families, thousands of them, many of whom now serve with the Syrian Arab Army. Though some were from Syria, others came from Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and the Philippines, even Australia. They were given travel documents and passports that passed high-level scrutiny and were flown to regions close enough to Syria to be trucked in by NGO’s, often fake medical organizations or refugee groups, that, in fact, were run by Western intelligence agencies. All the while, normal business travelers or tourists with their children would find themselves questioned and turned back if they attempted the same travel routes. This tells you who ISIS really is. Then I looked at the record of ISIS’ real commanders – military officers from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, one even a Brigadier General from Israel, captured by Shiite militias. I saw his identification papers and those of dozens of other ISIS leaders who still carried military identification from nations in the region. None were named “Baghdadi.” One was an American Major General, a former head of psychological warfare and later commentator on Fox News who was rescued from Syrian commandos by the US Delta Force, an organization founded by one of Veterans Today’s advisory board members. That raid, on May 15, 2015, was fictionalized in this ABC News report from that period: “In a ground raid deep in Syrian territory, U.S. special operations forces killed a top ISIS leader who they were attempting to capture and interrogate about American hostages and how the terror group finances its war machine,” the Obama administration said today. Officials told ABC News that “the large-scale operation that killed ISIS oil and gas ‘minister’ Abu Sayyaf was carried out by the Army’s elite counter-terror unit known as Delta Force under the direction of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).” The American general, who Russian sources said had planned ISIS military actions against Iraq, was rescued as a force of Syrian commandos and Russian Spetznaz approached. This was a real military success for the US, one where those involved deserved great credit even though it was done, as is too often the case, to advance the cause of international terrorism. You see, whoever Baghdadi is or was – and there are two stories, one that he was released from prison by Americans, trained in Jordan, and put in command of ISIS – in a real sense he never existed. The other story, one with more support, is that he is a British citizen of Jewish heritage named Shimon Elliott, trained in Israel to pass for an Arab, as thousands of Israeli intelligence operatives have over the years, and serves as “fake commander” for an equally fake terror group, ISIS. Whoever Baghdadi is or was, and reports from Russian sources inside Syria say he is in Iraq under American protection, it is reasonably sane to assume that his persona was fabricated to put a face on an intelligence operation that obviously advanced the cause of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States against Russia, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, a simple continuation of the wars begun after 9/11. To understand why ISIS exists or who created al Qaeda in its many guises, this May 2, 2007 quote from General Wesley Clark, former Chairman of the JCOS and NATO commander under President Clinton will help. The interviewer is Amy Goodman from Democracy Now, General Clark speaking: “But, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself exactly twice. What I did warn about when I testified in front of Congress in 2002, I said if you want to worry about a state, it shouldn’t be Iraq, it should be Iran. But this government, our administration, wanted to worry about Iraq, not Iran. “I knew why, because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. “He said, ‘Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me a second.’ I said, ‘Well, you’re too busy.’ He said, ‘No, no.” He says, ‘We’ve made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.” This was on or about the 20th of September. “I said, ‘We’re going to war with Iraq? Why?’ He said, ‘I don’t know.’ He said, ‘I guess they don’t know what else to do.’ So, I said, ‘Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?’ He said, ‘No, no.’ He says, ‘There’s nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.’ “He said, ‘I guess it’s like we don’t know what to do about terrorists, but we’ve got a good military and we can take down governments.’ And he said, ‘I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.’ “So, I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, ‘Are we still going to war with Iraq?’ And he said, ‘Oh, it’s worse than that.’ He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, ‘I just got this down from upstairs’ — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — ‘today.’ “And he said, ‘This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.’ I said, ‘Is it classified?’ He said, ‘Yes, sir.’ I said, ‘Well, don’t show it to me.’ And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, ‘You remember that?’ He said, ‘Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!’” Without this statement from General Clark, to an extent a man who had outlived his time, it would be impossible to put a perspective on today’s events. Did America create ISIS and al Qaeda? The probability of a “yes” for that would be 100%. Can history be used as proof? If not, then proof of every kind exists; and control of the internet, buying the media, filling it with paid “operatives” and silencing truthtellers has not been enough. Why did Baghdadi have to die, a real or imaginary Baghdadi who died a real or imaginary death? The issue is always timing. Look at the most recent death of Osama bin Laden and note, Baghdadi has died several times before, once in an Israeli hospital in 2015 according to media reports. With bin Laden, who sources say died in 2001, a daring operation in Pakistan, by operatives who mysteriously died in a helicopter crash soon after, the timing was even more curious. CIA Director Leon Panetta was retiring and that operation was the last of his career. He was being replaced by General Petraeus and, according to sources, it was necessary to “kill off” the endless number of fake bin Ladens so that Petraeus, a potential presidential candidate for the opposition party, would never be able to take credit. We are reminded of SEAL Team 6, credited with the bin Laden raid, from the statement made by President Obama on their fate: “Their deaths are a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families, including all who have served in Afghanistan,’’ President Obama said Saturday. “We will draw inspiration from their lives and continue the work of securing our country and standing up for the values that they embodied.” Of recent events, Jeffrey Epstein killing himself in prison, Baghdadi being hunted down somewhere he could never be by people flying invisible planes coordinated with governments that say it never happened, we could go on forever. All the while, the plan of conquest Wesley Clark read on that piece of paper so many years ago, plans made by absurd people serving an invisible master, has since become ingrained in history.

    "articleText": "Syria: the lessons of the “diplomatic academy” on the basis of Khmeimim by Dmitry Minin [ Editor’s note: We are far enough along in the Erdogan incursion into Syria to look at some of the early reporting to see who understood what was going on behind the scenes. I saved this Dmitry Minin piece to use as a retrospective, as we had plenty of VT material for the day-to-day action. Minin was definitely ahead of the curve. He nailed early, as we did, that Erdogan protected a weakness in not being willing to open up a broad front in Syria with his huge Turkish army resources to make it impossible for the SDF to defend. Erdogan only used several regular army brigades; and for lead troops, he boot-strapped a mixed bunch of militant thugs from Afrin and Idlib into the Syrian National Army front to lead the advance. Erdogan was obviously concerned about political problems from Turkish soldiers coming home in body bags. Such are not the concerns of a strong leader, but one viewing himself in a precarious position. Erdogan could not play Sultan by attacking north Syria with just a few army brigades and criminal mercenaries He was not expecting the SAA to respond so quickly, nor did the rest of us, as the Kurds’ deal with Damascus was put together in what appears to have been one meeting. Erdogan thought the SAA would not risk losing momentum to renew its goal of clearing Idlib of jihadis as critical for creating the conditions needed for possible new elections next year. There were other parties, the remains of the US coalition, that wanted to prevent this. With the jihadis beaten down to a guerrilla-war level, the Syrian refugees returning would take a lot of pressure off Lebanon, while Israel would prefer it remain under stress forever. The backdrop for all of this is that we can’t know what Trump is going to do, regardless of what he claims. And if he does something, he might undo it the next day or the next week. Where does that leave the public on trying to figure out where US policy is going? “Guessing” is the answer to that, which means we don’t have any real control over it, despite claims of living in a representative democracy. As Gordon loves to say, it’s a nasty world out there. More proof of that came out today in the story of CIA contractor death squads who have been keeping a tight rein on the drug-dealing in Afghanistan, killing those chosen as speed-bumps and writing the attacks off as anti-ISIS operations. But part of that mix has included “pesky” government reform people, who are also disposed of and added to the ISIS KIA sheet to show the US is getting the job done. Welcome to the world of using contractors who are not accountable. How have we not seen any real pressure to stop this, or even rein it in even from the veteran community, when more than a few veterans are involved? The vets seem to be the last ones to realize that questions might be asked of them – “Where were you, and why didn’t you do anything?”… Jim W.

Click to donate >> – First published … October 16, 2019 – At the end of the first week of the Turkish military invasion of Syria, there was a dramatic turn, which radically changed the strategic situation and, apparently, will significantly bring the general end of the war in the country. As a result of continuous hours-long negotiations at the “diplomatic academy” – the Center for Reconciliation of the Parties at the Russian base of Hmeimim – the representatives of the Syrian central government and the Syrian Kurds of Rojava managed to reach an agreement in principle on joint actions to counter Turkish intervention. The general picture at the theater of operations in the invasion zone immediately decisively changed. The advanced units of the government Syrian Arab Army (SAA), primarily from the 5th mechanized corps trained by Russian advisers, as well as the 7th mechanized division with lightning speed, occupied almost all the key points in Rozhava. In the west, they entered the large cities of Manbij and Kobani, thereby closing the way for the Turks to transfer reinforcements from Idlib and Afrin to the puppet Syrian National Army (SNA) they created. In the center of the SAA, the Euphrates unexpectedly jumped across the Kurdish-held largest dam in the city of Tabka and occupied Ein Assa, limiting the possibilities for expanding the Turkish “corridor” in this section. In the east of Rozhava, in the region of the actual capital of the local Kurds of Kamyshly, the SAA, despite all the vicissitudes, retained a well-fortified garrison of approximately brigade composition. Having received reinforcements, this compound almost completely controls the entire east of the region, leaving the Turks no chance of advancement in this part of the country. Thus, if you look at the map of Turkish aspirations and the actual state of the theater of war, it becomes obvious that the blitzkrieg of Ankara in Syria failed. Of the 340 km planned zone by the Turks, they managed to occupy only a strip of 80 km between the cities of Tell al-Abyad and Ras al-Ain. It is clearly seen that when the Syrian troops from the west and east close, and they will inevitably carry it out in the coming hours, the Turkish buffer will narrow even further. The Turkish army has extremely limited opportunities for further expansion and changing the situation in its favor. Foreign military analysts note that if in the early days of the Turkish military almost overwhelmed by euphoria, the Kurdish front broke up so unexpectedly easily, now they are in a state of confusion and concern. The Turks did not expect to fight the battle-hardened regular army of Syria, especially without the support of aviation, since Russia clearly warned that it would not allow it to be used against the SAA. In recent days, both the Minister of Defense and the Chief of the General Staff of Turkey have regularly called their Russian colleagues, apparently trying to give an expanded interpretation of the agreements on security zones between the parties. However, they are apparently clearly answered that all these concerns do not relate to the actions of the Syrian government army protecting the national border. In fact, Ankara self-confidently drove itself into a dead end, which could end for her a huge military, political and economic failure. Turkey made three major strategic mistakes. 1. First of all, she underestimated the possibility of reaching an agreement between the Kurdish leaders and the Syrian leadership, and also miscalculated the immediate intentions and capabilities of the latter. According to some sources, the Turks believed that Damascus would use their operation to advance in Idlib and would not have time to react to Turkish actions in Rojava. It turned out that Assad was ready to respond. 2. Turkey managed not to enlist the support of any state. She limited her capabilities, finding herself under a hail of international criticism, without the support of her closest allies, some of which, such as the United States, imposed sanctions against her. Finally, Erdogan, with his own hands, ensured the international legitimization of the Assad government in defense of the Kurds, which had been completely deprived of it for so long. 3. Wanting to limit their losses (primarily for domestic political reasons), the Turks used in the operation too little contingent (3-4 brigades). They tried to lay the main burden of battles on the Syrian National Army (SNA) they hastily created from the militants of Idlib and Afrin. And if the Turkish units at a number of points achieved their goals, then the SNA was everywhere defeated by the government SAA and the individual Kurdish detachments that joined it. Ankara is not able to carry out escalation at the expense of its own forces; the favorable moment for this has been missed. And this is only part of the problems faced by Turkey. According to one of the political leaders of the Syrian Kurds, the co-chairman of the Democratic Union Party (PDS) Salih Muslim, the agreement signed in Khmeimim Damascus and the Kurds contains, in particular, the following goal: according to the agreements, at this stage the parties will focus on taking control the borders of Rojava, and subsequently joint forces will begin the liberation of the Turkish-held Kurdish canton of Afrin. It is likely that this attack will affect Idlib. The Turks themselves gave grounds for this when they involved militants from Afrin and Idlib in operations in Rojava, violating all agreements on de-escalation zones. Instead of a “small victorious war”, the Turks may face such a turn of events for which they are simply not ready. S. Muslim categorically rejected all the accusations that the Kurds were releasing from the camps of IS militants (the organization is banned in Russia). “We did not free anyone. Those who managed to escape fled due to Turkish shelling of the camp and prisons. For example, the surroundings of the prison and the Ain Issa camp were bombed. In Ain Issa there were also American troops. Why were they silent when the Turks fired on the camp and the prison, why didn’t they stop the Turks? ” The government’s CAA has already approached this camp and is going to take custody of all the remaining camps. This will only increase the credibility of Damascus as a fighter against terrorism. It can be assumed that the failure of the Turkish operation in Syria will cause in Ankara a desire to shift the responsibility for this to someone else. It cannot be ruled out that a certain wave of dissatisfaction with the actions of Russia will arise. However, there is no reason for this. The best way out in this situation, turning it into a common victory of common sense, would be, for example, to use the intermediary services of the same “diplomatic academy” in Khmeimim. A productive dialogue with Damascus in the current conditions is the only option for “Ankara to save face” for Ankara. Based on the materials of the Strategic Culture Fund Loading...

    "articleText": "Fordow Nuclear Facility, Iran By Nauman Sadiq for VT Islamabad In response to Washington unilaterally cancelling the Iran nuclear deal and imposing sanctions on Iran, Tehran has announced on Tuesday that it will begin injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges at Fordow nuclear facility. Though like the previous retaliatory measures taken by the Hassan Rouhani government, this step too is reversible. Donald Trump has repeatedly said during the last three years that the Iran nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration in 2015 was an “unfair deal” that gave concessions to Iran without giving anything in return to the US. Unfortunately, there is a grain of truth in Trump’s statements because the Obama administration signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran in July 2015 under pressure, as Washington had bungled in its Middle East policy and it wanted Iran’s cooperation in Syria and Iraq to get a face-saving. In order to understand how the Obama administration bungled in Syria and Iraq, we should bear the background of Washington’s Middle East policy during the recent years in mind. The eight-year proxy war in Syria that gave birth to scores of militant groups, including the Islamic State, was directly responsible for the spate of Islamic State-inspired terror attacks in Europe from 2015 to 2017. Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in August 2011 to June 2014, when the Islamic State overran Mosul and Anbar in Iraq, an informal pact existed between the Western powers, their regional allies and jihadists of the Middle East against the Iran-led alliance comprising Syria and Hezbollah based in Lebanon. In accordance with the pact, militants were funded, trained and armed in the training camps located in the border regions of Turkey and Jordan to wage a proxy war against the Syrian government. This arrangement of an informal pact between the Western powers and the jihadists of the Middle East against the Iran-led alliance worked well up to August 2014, when the Obama Administration made a volte-face on its previous regime change policy in Syria and began conducting airstrikes against one group of jihadists battling the Syrian government, the Islamic State, after the latter overstepped its mandate in Syria and overran Mosul and Anbar in Iraq from where the US had withdrawn its troops only a couple of years ago in December 2011. After this reversal of policy in Syria by the Western powers and the subsequent Russian military intervention on the side of the Syrian government in September 2015, the momentum of jihadists’ expansion in Syria and Iraq stalled, and they felt that their Western patrons had committed a treachery against the jihadists’ cause, hence they were infuriated and rose up in arms to exact revenge for this betrayal. If we look at the chain of events, the timing of the spate of terror attacks against the West was critical: the Islamic State overran Mosul in June 2014, the Obama Administration began conducting air strikes against the Islamic State’s targets in Iraq and Syria in August 2014, and after a lull of almost a decade since the Madrid and London bombings in 2004 and 2005, respectively, the first such incident of terrorism occurred on the Western soil at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, and then the Islamic State carried out the audacious November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings, the June 2016 truck-ramming incident in Nice, and then three horrific terror attacks took place in the United Kingdom in 2017, and after that the Islamic State carried out the Barcelona attack in August 2017, and then another truck-ramming atrocity occurred in Lower Manhattan in October 2017 that was also claimed by the Islamic State. Keeping this background of the quagmire created by the Obama administration in Syria and Iraq in mind, it becomes amply clear that the Obama administration desperately needed Iran’s cooperation in Syria and Iraq to salvage its failed policy of training and arming jihadists to topple the government in Syria that backfired and gave birth to the Islamic State that carried out some of the most audacious terror attacks in Europe from 2015 to 2017. Thus, Washington signed JCPOA in July 2015 that gave some concessions to Iran, and in return, former hardliner Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki was forced out of power in September 2014 with Iran’s tacit approval and moderate former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was appointed in his stead who gave permission to the US Air Force and ground troops to assist the Iraqi Armed Forces and allied militias to beat back the Islamic State from Mosul and Anbar. However, Iran nuclear deal was neither an international treaty under the American laws nor even an executive agreement. It was simply categorized as a “political commitment.” Due to the influence of Zionist lobbies, the opposition to JCPOA in American political discourse was so vehement that forget about having it passed through the US Congress, the task the Obama administration faced was to muster enough votes of dissident Democrats to defeat a resolution of disapproval so that it couldn’t override a presidential veto. The Trump administration, however, is not hampered by the legacy of the Obama administration, and since the objective of defeating the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq has already been achieved, therefore Washington felt safe to annul the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and the crippling “third party” sanctions have once again been put in place on Iran at Benjamin Netanyahu’s behest. The sense of betrayal in Iran, however, is so fierce that recent subversive events in the Persian Gulf, including the September 14 attack on Abqaiq petroleum facility in Saudi Arabia, can also be explained if we bear in mind how Washington treacherously used the Iran nuclear deal to get a face-saving in Syria and Iraq without giving anything in return to Tehran. Although Houthi rebels based in Yemen claimed the responsibility for the complex attack involving drones and cruise missiles on the oil facility in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia, and they have UAV-X drones having a range of 1,500 kilometers, Washington dismissed the possibility. Instead it accused Tehran of mounting the attack from Iran’s territory which is unlikely. The most likely suspects were Iran-backed militias in Iraq, as 18 drones and 7 cruise missiles were launched from the north. The attack was an Armageddon for the global oil industry because Abqaiq petroleum facility in eastern Saudi Arabia processes five million barrels of oil per day. The entire industrialized world is running on the Gulf’s oil, and a subversive incident like the attack on Abqaiq petroleum facility would send jitters across the global markets, because the littoral states of Persian Gulf hold more than half of world’s proven oil reserves, 800 billion barrels out of world’s total 1,500 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. Besides planting limpet mines on the UAE’s oil tankers and shooting down an American Global Hawk surveillance drone, September 14 attack on Abqaiq oil facility was the third major attack against the US and its regional allies. Even though Washington has deployed several thousand American troops and additional Patriot missiles batteries in Saudi Arabia after the attack, unless the root cause of the conflict is resolved: waiving arbitrary sanctions on Iran, the likelihood of further such attacks targeting the global energy supply cannot be overruled, as unilateral sanctions begin to bite into Iran’s economy.

    "articleText": "…by Sajjad Shaukat, for Veterans Today Almost three months have been passed. Indian forces have continued lockdown and curfew in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). In order to hide human rights violations, communication services in that region have been cut off from the world and foreign delegations and journalists are not allowed to enter the IOK. On August 5, 2019, New Delhi unilaterally annexed the IOK, revoking articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution which gave a special status to Kashmir. The aftermath has witnessed war within India, as besides leaders of Western countries and their media, India’s opposition parties, various leaders; renowned entities and media criticized the illegal moves of the Modi government. While, Indian extremist rulers are also escalating tensions with Pakistan to divert attention from the drastic situation of the Indian Held Kashmir, and have continued shelling inside Pakistani side of Kashmir by violating the ceasefire agreement in relation to the Line of Control (LoC). In this regard, Business Standard wrote: “The chiefs of three armed forces met Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, a defense ministry spokesperson said. Sources said Singh reviewed the security situation. Indian military is in a fiasco and feels burdened with domestic and international pressures on IOK. Indian narrative has not been successful, thanks to Pakistan’s aggressive foreign policy initiatives. Even within India, many people in society are worried that a serious blow back continues to simmer and waits lifting of curfew. Indian government already feels stuck and this meeting was in the context to induce a reaction from Pakistan to shift focus of world from Kashmir crisis to a conflict between two nuke capable neighbours”. Business Standard also pointed out, “India said it was regrettable that a few U.S lawmakers used a Congressional hearing to question measures to protect lives of people in J&K [Jammu and Kashmir]. Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that U.S Congressional hearing on Kashmir was a reflection of lack of understanding about robust functioning of democratic institutions in India. He said that we are regularly updating the U.S government about situation in Kashmir. India has been badly exposed to the world on her stance over IOK. US Congressional hearing is an evident proof that India has surfaced on the scope of troubled regions and merits world’s attention. Simply by giving statements, India cannot hide her war crimes and state sponsored terrorism against people of IOK. Concern shown by numerous US law makers also indicates that US view on IOK does not align with Indian perspective”. CNN News 18 wrote: “A senior UK politician claimed that the Indian government withdrew with little explanation its invitation to him to be part of an EU delegation…on a visit to Kashmir after he demanded to speak with local people without a police escort. A delegation of 23 MPs from EU reached Srinagar for a two day visit…briefed on the situation by government officials and also met a cross section of local people. The team originally comprised 27 parliamentarians, mostly from extreme right or right wing parties. Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament Chris Davies said the decision showed the Indian government was trying to hide the reality of its actions and blocking absolute freedom of the press. Modi’s desire to create a PR event in IOK has miserably backfired. Inviting far right MPs from EU and taking them to IOK on a guided tour with no freedom to interact with locals has been criticized in Europe, UK and India. Such activities act as catalyst in convincing world that all reports about atrocities in IOK by Indian military stands verified. Withdrawing invitation of one member, a senior UK politician who had asked to speak and move freely in IOK without protection has confirmed the fears of world bodies. The withdrawal of invitation has made more news than the event itself”. According to Indian Express, “Union Minister Jitendra Singh has said that the day is not far off when the Indian flag will be unfurled in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir. India is giving her masses a utopian hope. Neither people of IOK nor Pakistan is willing to let India annex J&K. With 900,000 troops committing killings, detentions, rapes and use of pellet guns, aggressive reaction of the local Kashmiri people will make India stumble. No amount of oppression or fake narratives can hide reality of Indian brutal annexation”. Times of India wrote: “India…called as ‘naked propaganda’ Islamabad taking a group of foreign diplomats to POK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] after India’s artillery fire targeting several terror launch pads along the LoC in Kashmir…Pakistan had very openly offered Indian government to allow her Ambassador to Islamabad to visit alongside other 22 diplomats to the targeted area and indicate the alleged launch pads. The response is still awaited from India. Avoiding this opportunity to verify own claims testifies against Indian narrative. The visiting diplomats have seen proofs of Indian firing, the damages caused on to civil population and interacted with local population to find the reality, which is totally against what India is telling her masses”. Hindustan Times wrote: “The October 27, anti-India protests in London over Kashmir will not be allowed to gather or culminate outside the Indian high commission, Scotland Yard has informed organizers, following pressure from New Delhi and the Indian community concerned over a possible repeat of the recent violence…Violators will be arrested under Public Order Act. The battle for Kashmir will not be fought in J&K region alone, rather Kashmiris will take this conflict to all continents of the world…More protests in more capitals of the world will continue to take place. UK has likely taken this decision due to likely development of any law and order situation but it does not imply that UK agrees with Indian narrative”. Deccan Herald indicated: “Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Ranbir Singh and eight other men from the armed forces had a miraculous escape when the Dhruv Advanced Light-weight helicopter they were traveling crashed at Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir. Army officials said all the nine passengers and crew on-board including Singh received injuries but there was no danger to their lives. Much propagated DHRUV heli-built by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is highly controversial project propagated to be Made In India while it was designed and collaborated on by Germany…Since 2007, this is the 11th crash of the HAL-made Dhruv ALH, which is being projected by the Defence Ministry as a product fit for exports. Almost a decade ago, India sold ALH to Ecuador, out of which one crashed during a military parade in 2009. Subsequently, there was a second crash. Six years after the incident, the Defence Ministry in February 2015 informed the Parliament that pending findings of the Court of Inquiry set up by Ministry of Defence, Ecuador, consisting of representatives from Ecuadorian Army and Navy into the cause of the two recent accidents of Dhruva, Ecuador Air Force suspended flying their Dhruva helicopters.” According to NDTV, “India’s former Prime Minister and leader of the opposition party Manmohan Singh stated the Congress had voted in favour of the bill to abrogate Article 370 in J&K and the party had only raised a problem with its implementation. “We believe Article 370 is a temporary measure but if a change has to be brought, it should be with the goodwill of the people of Jammu and Kashmir”. This implies that BJP has virtually no opposition left in so-called democratic India to resist brutality in IOK. ‘Times Now’ quoted Mehbooba Mufti’s message [Former Chief Minister of IOK] on Twitter hitting out at the BJP for its demand to confer Bharat Ratna [Highest Civil Award] on Hindutva [Hindu Natinalism] ideologue VD Savarkar who justified rape as a weapon of war”. It is mentionable that addressing an election rally at Ausa in Maharashtra’s Latur district for state polls which held on the October 21, 2019, Indian Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on October 13, 2019: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi abrogated Articles 370 and 35A on one hand and farmer-unemployment issues on the other…Prime Minister Modi and…BJP nationalist president…Union Home Minister Amit Shah are deflecting the core issues and asking youths to watch the moon when they are demanding jobs…the media is [also] distracting people’s attention from the real issues like the downfall of the economy…Most of the media houses are owned by big corporate houses and some of their names are well-known such as Ambani, Adani etc. The Modi government has waived Rs 5.5 lakh crore [loan] of these people…divisive politics is one of the reasons behind the closure of scores of factories…What Modi and Shah are doing is to divert the attention of the people from the real issues and focus on Corbett Park, Moon, China Pakistan…They are conveniently silent on the issues that are plaguing the country…the real objective of moves like demonetisation in 2016 and rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was to help the rich at the cost of the poor people….The real target of the note ban and GST was to take out money from pockets of poor and give it to the rich”. Regarding India’s economic problems, Al Jazeera pointed out on August 30, 2019: “Fears of an economic slowdown in India are mounting after figures published…showed that growth slackened to its slowest pace in six years. India’s economy grew only five percent year over year from April to June [2019], according to data released by the country’s Central Statistics Office. Overcoming anemic economic activity is a major hurdle for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it aims to transform India into a $5 trillion economy by 2024…Multiple indicators suggest trouble is brewing in India’s economy. The auto industry, seen as a bellwether for activity, has reportedly laid off 350,000 workers since April…Many of the measures were U-turns on Sitharaman’s July budget announcement, which was criticised by some as unnecessarily punitive to business….The value of new projects announced between 2018 and 2019 hit a 14-year low, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. This indicates a lack of business confidence. Financial markets have also not recovered fully from a liquidity crisis induced by last year’s collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, a major non-bank lender… India’s tax revenue is currently 16 percent short of budget estimates due, according to the Economic Survey 2018-19. …The July budget, which came after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party secured a huge victory in the May 2019 elections, also disappointed those who expected to see greater clarity on the government’s reform agenda…Critics have recently suggested the recent revocation of article 370, which has brought media reports of unrest to Indian-administered Kashmir, is a tool to detract attention away from an ailing economy.” It is notable that in 2017, Indian government of PM Modi announced economic reforms, claiming that the country’s economy was in a strong position. Instead of improving the economy, Premier Modi wanted to make India, an economic power to counter China. Modi’s hastily planned economic reforms created many domestic social evils in the country and have resulted into wearisome economic policies for citizens. In this respect, BJP former lawmaker and finance minister Yashwant Sinha, while pointing out poorly planned economic reforms stated: “Private investment has shrunk as never before in two decades, industrial production has all but collapsed, agriculture is in distress, construction industry, a big employer of the work force, is in the doldrums and exports have dwindled.” On March 6, this year, Rahul Gandhi claimed: “There is now enough evidence to prosecute Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Rafale deal…the trail of corruption in the Rafale fighter jet deal begins and ends with…therefore, an FIR should be lodged against him…crucial Rafale files incriminating him are now reported stolen by the Government, is destruction of evidence.” It worth-mentioning that during a visit to France in 2015, Modi scrapped the deal, signed under the previous government led by the Congress party, and ordered instead 36 jets—all to be built in France— for an estimated $9.4 billion. According to a report about India, “Of its more than 1 billion inhabitants, nearly 260.3 million are below the poverty line, of which 193.2 million are in the rural areas and 67.1 million are in urban areas”. Failure of Modi’s economic plans has especially affected the Indian police officials who have accelerated the practice of corruption. Besides, since the leader of the ruling party BJP Modi became Prime Minister of India, various developments like unprecedented rise of Hindu extremism, persecution of minorities even of lower cast-Hindus, forced conversions of other religious minorities into Hindus, ban on beef and cow slaughter, inclusion of Hindu religious books in curriculum, creation of war-like situation with Pakistan etc. clearly show that encouraged by the Hindu fundamentalist outfits such as BJP, RSS VHP, Bajrang Dal and Shiv Sena, including other similar parties have been promoting religious and ethnic chauvinism in India by propagating ideology of Hindutva. Particularly, assaults on Christians and Muslims, including their places of worships and property have been intensified by the fanatic Hindu mobs. In the Indian general elections of 2019, BJP and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won huge majority in the Lok Sabha, with the BJP sweeping up 303 seats on its own—21 seats more than it won in the 2014 elections. Across most of North and Central India, BJP candidates also won with bigger vote shares and wider victory margins than in 2014. Hindu majority was mobilized on ‘hate Muslim’ slogans and ‘anti-Pakistan’ jargons, while the incessant and unjust Indian propaganda against the Muslims and Pakistan was beyond anybody’s cognition, which still keeps on going. Indian Prime Minister Modi’s extremist party BJP had also got a land sliding triumph in the Indian elections 2014 on the basis of anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan slogans. As regards Modi’s victory in the elections 2019, India’s many politicians and analysts opined, “Modi’s election win is a victory for far right Hindu nationalism…India’s secular democracy is under threat…BJP’s record in 2015-2019 has been divisive to say the least. The party has marginalised religious minorities, especially Muslims, from public life with many, as a result, being lynched by Hindu nationalists in the name of cow protection…Jingoism and Islamophobia have propelled the BJP to an even stronger showing than in 2014. A Modi victory puts India’s 200 million Muslims in danger…Modi is part of the large Hindu supremacist family…In his home state of Odisha, he furthered India’s sectarian divide, pushed the idea of Hindu supremacy and with that, violence against Muslims, Christians and other minorities…Modi is radicalising Muslims.” Nonetheless, we can conclude that owing to the continued lockdown in the Indian Held Kashmir, the war within India has accelerated, as PM Modi has failed in diverting attention from internal issues and problems which the country has been facing.

    "articleText": "By Nauman Sadiq for VT Islamabad During the Soviet-Afghan conflict from 1979 to 1988 between the capitalist and communist blocs, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab States took the side of the former because the Soviet Union and the Central Asian states produced more energy and consumed less. Thus, the Soviet bloc was the net exporter of energy, whereas the capitalist bloc led by Washington was the net importer of energy. It suited the economic interests of the oil-rich Gulf countries to maintain and strengthen a supplier-consumer relationship with the capitalist bloc. Now the BRICS countries are equally hungry for the Middle East’s energy, but it’s a recent development. During the Cold War, an alliance with the industrialized world was predicated upon the economic interests of the Gulf states, which was given a religious color of purportedly “anticommunist” Islamist ideology by the Salafist preachers of Saudi Arabia. All the celebrity terrorists, whose names are now heard in the mainstream media every day, were the spawns of the Soviet-Afghan War: including Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri, the Haqqanis, the Taliban, the Hekmatyars etc. But that war wasn’t limited only to Afghanistan. The alliance between the Western powers and their regional client states during the Cold War funded, trained, armed and internationally legitimized the Islamic jihadists all over the Islamic World. We hear the names of jihadist groups operating in regions as far afield as the Central Asian States, the North Caucasus and even in Bosnia and Kosovo in the Balkans. Regarding the objectives of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, then American envoy to Kabul, Adolph “Spike” Dubs, was assassinated on the Valentine’s Day, on 14 Feb 1979, the same day that Iranian revolutionaries stormed the American embassy in Tehran. The former Soviet Union was wary that its forty-million Muslims were susceptible to radicalism, because Islamic radicalism was infiltrating across the border into the Central Asian States from Afghanistan. Therefore, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 in support of the Afghan communists to forestall the likelihood of Islamist insurgencies spreading to the Central Asian States bordering Afghanistan. According to documents declassified by the White House, CIA and State Department in January, as reported [1] by Tim Weiner for The Washington Post, the CIA was aiding Afghan jihadists before the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. President Jimmy Carter signed the CIA directive to arm the Afghan jihadists in July 1979, whereas the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December the same year. The revelation doesn’t come as a surprise, though, because more than two decades before the declassification of the State Department documents, in the 1998 interview [2] to The Counter Punch Magazine, former National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, Zbigniew Brzezinski, confessed that the president signed the directive to provide secret aid to the Afghan jihadists in July 1979, whereas the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan six months later in December 1979. Here is a poignant excerpt from the interview. The interviewer puts the question: “And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic jihadists, having given arms and advice to future terrorists?” Brzezinski replies: “What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?” Despite the crass insensitivity, one must give credit to Zbigniew Brzezinski that at least he had the courage to speak the unembellished truth. It’s worth noting, however, that the aforementioned interview was recorded in 1998. After the 9/11 terror attack, no Western policymaker can now dare to be as blunt and forthright as Brzezinski. Regardless, that the CIA was arming the Afghan jihadists six months before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan has been proven by the State Department’s declassified documents; fact of the matter, however, is that the nexus between the CIA, Pakistan’s security agencies and the Gulf states to train and arm the Afghan jihadists against the former Soviet Union was forged years before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistan joined the American-led, anticommunist SEATO and CENTO regional alliances in the 1950s and played the role of Washington’s client state since its inception in 1947 as a former colony of the British Empire. So much so that when a United States U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Air Defense Forces while performing photographic aerial reconnaissance deep into Soviet territory, Pakistan’s then President Ayub Khan openly acknowledged the reconnaissance aircraft flew from an American airbase in Peshawar, a city in northwest Pakistan. Historically, Pakistan’s military first used the Islamists of Jamaat-e-Islami as proxies during the Bangladesh war of liberation in the late 1960s against the Bangladeshi nationalist Mukti Bahini liberation movement of Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rahman – the father of current prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, and the founder of Bangladesh, which was then a province of Pakistan and known as East Pakistan before the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. Jamaat-e-Islami is a far-right Islamist movement in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh – analogous to the Muslim Brotherhood political party in Egypt and Turkey – several of whose leaders have recently been imprisoned and executed by the Bangladeshi nationalist government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed for committing massacres of Bangladeshi civilians on the orders of Pakistan’s military during the Bangladesh war of liberation. Then during the 1970s, Pakistan’s then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began aiding the Afghan Islamists against Sardar Daud’s government, who had toppled his first cousin King Zahir Shah in a palace coup in 1973 and had proclaimed himself the president of Afghanistan. Sardar Daud was a Pashtun nationalist and laid claim to Pakistan’s northwestern Pashtun-majority province. Pakistan’s security establishment was wary of his irredentist claims and used Islamists to weaken his rule in Afghanistan. He was eventually assassinated in 1978 as a consequence of the Saur Revolution led by the Afghan communists. Pakistan’s support to the Islamists with the Saudi petro-dollars and Washington’s blessings, however, kindled the fires of Islamist insurgencies in the entire region comprising Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Central Asian States, and even in the Indian-administered Kashmir. Regarding the Kashmir dispute, there can be no two views that the right of self-determination of Kashmiris must be respected in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions on the right of plebiscite to the Kashmiri people, and the international community must lend its moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people. But at the same time, the militarization of any dispute, including Kashmir, must be avoided due to human suffering that militancy and wars anywhere in the world inevitably entail. The insurgency in Kashmir erupted in the fateful year 1984 of the Orwellian-fame when the Indian armed forces surreptitiously occupied the whole of Siachen glacier, including the un-demarcated Pakistani portion, on the Pakistan-India border in Kashmir. Now, we must keep the backdrop in mind: those were the heydays of the Cold War and Pakistan army’s proxies, the Afghan jihadists, were triumphantly waging a guerrilla warfare during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, and the morale of Pakistan’s military’s top brass was touching the sky. In addition, Pakistan’s security establishment wanted to inflict damage to the Indian armed forces to exact revenge for the dismemberment of Pakistan at the hands of India during the Bangladesh War of 1971, when India provided support to Bangladeshi nationalists and took 90,000 Pakistani soldiers as prisoners of war after Pakistan’s defeat in the Bangladesh war of liberation. All the military’s top brass had to do was to divert a fraction of its Afghan jihadist proxies toward the Indian-administered Kashmir to kindle the fires of insurgency. Pakistan’s security agencies began sending jihadists experienced in the Afghan asymmetric warfare across the border to the Indian-administered Kashmir in the late 1980s; and by the early 1990s, the Islamist insurgency had engulfed the whole of Jammu and Kashmir region.

    "articleText": "\"And that includes the truth about Wikileaks\" - Jim W. Dean I’ve received a reply from my MP Alister Jack (who is also Secretary of State for Scotland). I asked him to obtain an explanation from our Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP, on concerns about the proceedings to extradite Julian Assange to the US, since he is the person accountable. But Mr Jack’s response doesn’t make clear whether the response is his and, if not, where it actually come from. I wanted to know… Why Assange is held under the inhuman conditions reserved for terrorists when he’s a journalist. How the Justice Department accounts for Assange’s poor physical and mental state. Why the question whether political offences are excluded from extradition under Article 4 of the UK/US Extradition Treaty hadn’t been not been addressed before these expensive proceedings began. Why Assange’s defence team haven’t been given easier access and more time to prepare. Why high-security Belmarsh is chosen for February’s hearing, where the opportunity for public scrutiny is minimal. And whether District Judge Baraitser will preside in February when, according to Craig Murray, she has already failed to behave impartially? In particular I wanted to know why, according to witnesses, Assange’s physical and mental states have deteriorated so rapidly while in the UK justice system’s care. There’s no attempt to answer most of these points. However, Mr Jack reminds me that Assange was jailed for 50 weeks on 1 May for breaching bail and holing up in the Ecuadore Embassy. “The UK’s criminal justice system is one in which rights are protected and in which, contrary to what Mr Assange and his supporters may claim, he and his interests will be protected,” writes Mr Jack brimming with confidence. But, he points out, the Home Secretary when signing an extradition warrant is limited in what he’s allowed to consider. For example, the Crime and Courts Act 2013 requires any judgement about human rights and health issues to be made in court. The administrative hearing on 21 October ruled that Assange will face a 5-day extradition hearing starting 25 February and, Mr Jack says, that’s when his human rights and poor health will be considered. It is for the judge to determine whether or not extradition would be a human rights breach and whether it would be oppressive and unjust on account of his state of health. In other words, nobody in the UK justice system could give a toss about Assange’s wellbeing for another 4 months – an awful long time when you’re already in bad shape and worried sick that you’ll wind up in Guantanamo Bay for….. for what, exactly? Former ambassador Craig Murray, a friend of Assange, attended the October hearing and reported that he was distressed by how his appearance had deteriorated after long confinement, and by his rapid ageing and stumbling speech — “the most articulate man, the fastest thinker, I have ever known” reduced to a “shambling and incoherent wreck”. Some have expressed concern that Assange may not live to the end of the extradition proceedings. From tomorrow MPs will cease to exist and Parliament will cease to function until after the general election on 12 December. So nobody is representing anybody in the cesspit of Westminster for the next 5 or 6 weeks. Stuart Littlewood 5 November 2019 Loading...

    "title": "Former congressional aide: Israel is a problem child",
    "description": "“The Israelis ‘thought they could just snap their fingers’ and get friends in Congress to legislate visa changes, a Hill aide said, instead of going through the required hoops with DHS.”",
    "articleText": "…by Jonas E. Alexis It was not too long ago when much of the mass media and political puppets were perpetuating the idea that Russia hacked the 2016 presidential election.[1] This idea largely came from the Neoconservatives,[2] the very people who say ad nauseam that Israel is a friend of the United States. Neocon puppet Dick Cheney declared that Vladimir Putin himself “took his capabilities in the cyber area and used it to try to influence our election. In some quarters, that would be considered an act of war.”[3] The late John McCain said then: “When you attack a country, it’s an act of war. We have to make sure that there is a price to pay” for countries like Russia.[4] Jewish Neocons like Max Boot were already in an ideological bandwagon trumpeting the idea that Russia hacked the election. Boot went to Fox News to tell the entire world that this was a brute fact. Tucker rightly responded by saying that Boot should “choose a different profession. Selling insurance. House painting. Something you’re good at.” Boot and other Neocons at think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute launched an organization called “Committee to Investigate Russia” last year because, as Rob Reiner and others who supported this “investigation” said, they wanted to “understand the gravity of Russia’s invasion of our democracy.”[5] The interesting thing is that the Committee to Investigate Russia will never “help Americans recognize and understand the gravity” of the Neoconservative ideology in America, the Middle East, and much of the West. That the Neoconservative movement has morally and politically weakened much of the West can no longer be disputed. The scholarly literature on this very issue is just an embarrassment to riches,[6] and CIR will never take the time to look at this abundance of evidence precisely because it would literally destroy the very principle upon which CIR is operating. As we have repeatedly argued in the past, covert organizations like CIR will never examine the US’ diabolical operation in Iran in 1953, the destruction of countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, etc. They will never talk about how Jewish Neocons like Max Boot himself supported the NSA’s covert operation around the world.[7] In any event, Politico reported last September that “The U.S. government concluded within the past two years that Israel was most likely behind the placement of cellphone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around Washington, according to three former senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.”[8] Guess what? Not a single Neocon has come out of the woodwork saying that this needs serious investigation. Not a single media outlet has ever said that that this is wrong. When it was erroneously reported that Russia hacked the election, media outlets like Mother Jones declare that “Congress must investigate.”[9] Mother Jones was nowhere to be found when Israel got caught rid-handed. Dick Cheney didn’t dare say that this was an act of war either. Interestingly enough, in response to the news that Israel continues to spy on the US, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency risibly declares that “Espionage does not always involve a leap into cloak and dagger; it can evolve from simple business conversations.”[10] The same Jewish agency moves on to saying that spying “happens less often than you’d think” and that sometimes “what looks like spying is cooperation.”[11] Complete nonsense! Only Israel has to enjoy that kind of privilege. Trump, Israel’s puppet, was completely incoherent about the whole issue. “But unlike most other occasions when flagrant incidents of foreign spying have been discovered on American soil, the Trump administration did not rebuke the Israeli government, and there were no consequences for Israel’s behavior, one of the former officials said.”[12] The interesting thing is that Israel was deliberately intended to spy on the White House. Trump, instead of proceeding to ask for a full-fledge investigation, bizarrely declared: “I don’t think the Israelis were spying on us. My relationship with Israel has been great…Anything is possible but I don’t believe it.”[13] Sure! The inescapable fact is that Israel has been spying on the US for years. Israel even spies on US citizens. Jeff Stein of Newsweek itself declared in 2014 that “Israel won’t stop spying on the U.S.”[14] Stein declared: “U.S. intelligence officials are saying—albeit very quietly, behind closed doors on Capitol Hill—that our Israeli ‘friends’ have gone too far with their spying operations here. According to classified briefings on legislation that would lower visa restrictions on Israeli citizens, Jerusalem’s efforts to steal U.S. secrets under the cover of trade missions and joint defense technology contracts have ‘crossed red lines.’ “Israel’s espionage activities in America are unrivaled and unseemly, counterspies have told members of the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees, going far beyond activities by other close allies, such as Germany, France, the U.K. and Japan. A congressional staffer familiar with a briefing last January called the testimony ‘very sobering…alarming…even terrifying.’ Another staffer called it ‘damaging.’ The Jewish state’s primary target: America’s industrial and technical secrets.”[15] Alain Gresh of the Nation added that these people “were spying on US citizens with the help of Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs, founded in 2006, which reports directly to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One official said: ‘We are a different government working on foreign soil, [so] we have to be very, very cautious.’”[16] Virtually every government official has been frustrating with the Israelis precisely because they think they can do just about anything and get away with it. Quoting again Jeff Stein of Newsweek: “I.C. Smith, a former top FBI counterintelligence specialist during the Pollard affair, tells Newsweek, ‘In the early 1980s, dealing with the Israelis was, for those assigned that area, extremely frustrating. The Israelis were supremely confident that they had the clout, especially on the Hill, to basically get [away] with just about anything. This was the time of the Criteria Country List—later changed to the National Security Threat List—and I found it incredible that Taiwan and Vietnam, for instance, were on [it], when neither country had conducted activities that remotely approached the Pollard case, and neither had a history of, or a comparable capability to conduct, such activities…’ “The Israelis ‘thought they could just snap their fingers’ and get friends in Congress to legislate visa changes, a Hill aide said, instead of going through the required hoops with DHS.” One former congressional aide said: “The Israelis haven’t done shit to get themselves into the visa waiver program…. If we give them free rein to send people over here, how are we going to stop that? They’re incredibly aggressive. They’re aggressive in all aspects of their relationship with the United States. Why would their intelligence relationship with us be any different?”[17] Obviously Israel is a problem child. We give them at least three billion dollars every year, but it seems that they are using the very financial and technological resources we have provided them against us. Moreover, if you dare say something constructive about these issues, you are therefore ipso facto an anti-Semite. Listen to this: “Pro-Israel and conservative lobbyists are encouraging state lawmakers to outlaw antisemitism in public education, from kindergarten through to graduate universities. But the proposed definition of antisemitism is so wide that, in addition to standard protections against hate speech towards Jews, it would also prohibit debate about the human rights violations of the Israeli government.”[18] This is a serious problem here.

    "articleText": "By Nauman Sadiq for VT Islamabad A car bomb exploded [1] in northern Syria killing 13 and wounding 20. The blast on Saturday ripped through a crowded market in Tal Abyad, a town recently occupied by Turkish-backed militant proxies. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted pro-Turkey fighters and civilians were also among the dead. Even though the Turkish Defense Ministry promptly laid the finger of blame on Turkey’s arch-foe, the Kurdish YPG militia, without conducting an investigation, car bombing as a tactic for causing widespread fear is generally employed by jihadist groups and not by the Kurds. It’s important to note in the news coverage about the killing of al-Baghdadi that although the mainstream media had been trumpeting for the last several years that the Islamic State’s fugitive chief had been hiding somewhere on the Iraq-Syria border in the east, he was found hiding in the northwestern Idlib governorate, under the control of Turkey’s militant proxies and al-Nusra Front, and was killed while trying to flee to Turkey in Barisha village five kilometers from the border. The morning after the night raid, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported [2] on Sunday, October 27, that a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by warplanes belonging to the international coalition had attacked positions of Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, in Idlib province where the Islamic State chief was believed to be hiding. According to “official version” [3] of Washington’s story regarding the killing of al-Baghdadi, the choppers took off from an American airbase in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, flew hundreds of miles over the enemy territory in the airspace controlled by the Syrian and Russian air forces, killed the self-proclaimed “caliph” of the Islamic State in a Hollywood-style special-ops raid, and took the same route back to Erbil along with the dead body of the “caliph” and his belongings. Although Washington has conducted several airstrikes in Syria’s Idlib in the past, those were carried out by fixed-wing aircraft that fly at high altitudes, and the aircraft took off from American airbases in Turkey, which is just across the border from Syria’s northwestern Idlib province. Why would Washington take the risk of flying its troops at low altitudes in helicopters over the hostile territory controlled by myriads of Syria’s heavily armed militant outfits? In fact, several Turkish journalists, including Rajip Soylu, the Turkey correspondent for the Middle East Eye, tweeted [4] on the night of the special-ops raid that the choppers took off from the American airbase in Turkey’s Incirlik. As for al-Baghdadi, who was “hiding” with the blessing of Turkey, it now appears that he was the bargaining chip in the negotiations between Trump and Erdogan, and the quid for the US president’s agreeing to pull out of Syria was the pro quo that Erdogan would hand Baghdadi to him on a silver platter. After the betrayal of its erstwhile allies, the Islamic jihadists, by the Erdogan administration, a tidal wave of terrorism in Turkey was expected, and its first installment has apparently been released in the form of a car bombing in Tal Abyad in northern Syria occupied by Turkish-backed militant proxies. The reason why the Trump administration is bending over backwards to appease Ankara is that Turkish President Erdogan has been drifting away from Washington’s orbit into Russia’s sphere of influence. Even though the Kurds too served the imperialist masters loyally for the last five years of Syria’s proxy war, the choice boiled down to choosing between the Kurds and Turkey, and Washington understandably chose its NATO ally. Turkey, which has the second largest army in NATO, has been cooperating with Russia in Syria against Washington’s interests for the last several years and has also placed an order for the Russian-made S-400 missile system, whose first installment has already been delivered. In order to understand the significance of relationship between Washington and Ankara, it’s worth noting that the United States has been conducting airstrikes against targets in Syria from the Incirlik airbase and around fifty American B-61 hydrogen bombs have also been deployed there, whose safety became a matter of real concern during the foiled July 2016 coup plot against the Erdogan administration; when the commander of the Incirlik airbase, General Bekir Ercan Van, along with nine other officers were arrested for supporting the coup; movement in and out of the base was denied, power supply was cut off and the security threat level was raised to the highest state of alert, according to a report [5] by Eric Schlosser for the New Yorker. Perceptive readers who have been keenly watching Erdogan’s behavior since the foiled July 2016 coup plot against the Erdogan administration must have noticed that Erdogan has committed quite a few reckless and impulsive acts during the last few years. Firstly, the Turkish air force shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 fighter jet on the border between Syria and Turkey on 24 November 2015 that brought the Turkish and Russian armed forces to the brink of a full-scale confrontation in Syria. Secondly, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was assassinated at an art exhibition in Ankara on the evening of 19 December 2016 by an off-duty Turkish police officer, Mevlut Mert Altintas, who was suspected of being an Islamic fundamentalist. Thirdly, the Turkish military mounted the seven-month Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria, immediately after the attempted coup plot, from August 2016 to March 2017 that brought the Turkish military and its Syrian militant proxies head-to-head with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and their American backers. Fourthly, Ankara invaded Idlib in northwestern Syria in October 2017 on the pretext of enforcing a de-escalation zone between the Syrian militants and the Syrian government, despite official protest from Damascus that the Turkish armed forces were in violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Fifthly, Turkey mounted Operation Olive Branch in the Kurdish-held enclave Afrin in northwestern Syria from January to March 2018. And lastly, the Turkish armed forces and their Syrian jihadist proxies invaded and occupied 120 kilometers stretch of Syrian territory between the northern towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn on October 9, even before the American forces had a chance to fully withdraw from their military bases in northern Syria, as soon as an understanding between Trump and Erdogan was reached in a telephonic conversation on October 6. To avoid confrontation between myriads of local militant groups and their regional and international backers, Russia once again displayed the stroke of a genius by playing the role of a peace-maker in Syria, and concluded an agreement with Turkey in a Putin-Erdogan meeting in Sochi, Russia, on October 22 to enforce a “safe zone” in northern Syria. According to the terms of the agreement, Turkish forces would have exclusive control over 120 kilometers stretch between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn to the depth of 32 kilometers in northern Syria. To the west and east of the aforementioned area of the Turkish Operation Peace Spring, Turkish troops and Russian military police would conduct joint patrols to the depth of 10 kilometers in the Syrian territory, and the remaining 20 kilometers “safe zone” would be under the control of Syrian government which would ensure that the Kurdish forces and weapons are evacuated from Manbij, Kobani and Tal Rifat to the west and the Kurdish areas to the east, excluding the city of Qamishli.

    "title": "Biden:  Trump’s Syria oil ploy intended to bring back ISIS",
    "description": "Biden was involved in the Central Intelligence Agency’s classified weapons supply and training programme, known as Timber Sycamore",
    "articleText": "…from Sputnik News, Moscow – On Friday, Trump said he “liked” Syria’s oil and that the US would be “keeping the oil,” with his remarks coming in the wake of a report by Russian military intelligence that the US military and CIA had teamed up with US oil companies and military contractors to illegally smuggle tens of millions of dollars of oil out of the war-torn country. Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticised Donald Trump over his Syria policy, saying it has only worked to strengthen Russia, Iran and Daesh (ISIS)* terrorists. “Leaving troops behind like [Trump’s] doing now – he says that what he wants to do is we’re going to occupy the oil fields and we’re going to take ‘em. That’s like a giant 300-foot recruiting poster for ISIS,” Biden said, speaking to the Wall Street Journal. “And so, I don’t think he has a foreign policy,” Biden added. “Russia’s position in the region has just been strengthened. [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s position has been strengthened. Iran now has a pathway all the way to Syria and even to Lebanon. If I’m the Israelis I’m not going to be very happy about that. So the whole thing has been turned upside down and we’re in there alone now, basically,” the former vice president said. Biden did not clarify how it was simultaneously possible to ‘strengthen’ both Daesh and Russia, Syria and Iran, three of the countries which have played a major role in destroying the terrorist group’s self-proclaimed ‘caliphate’ in Syria. Timber Sycamore During his tenure as Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden was a key supporter of sending US arms to the militants fighting against Damascus. He was involved in the Central Intelligence Agency’s classified weapons supply and training programme, known as Timber Sycamore, which equipped and trained thousands of fighters between 2012 and 2017, when it was closed down by the Trump administration. Over the past several years, the Syrian army has been finding dozens of arms caches containing US sourced or made guns, mortars, TOW anti-tank guided missiles, night vision goggles and other equipment. © PHOTO: YOUTUBE/SANA Syrian Army Uncover Massive Haul of US-Made Weapons for Rebels Trump: ‘I Like Oil. We’re Keeping the Oil’ Despite the move to end US support for militants fighting against Assad, Trump has refused to pull out all of the US troops in Syria. On Friday, he told reporters that the US would be keeping troops in northeastern Syria to guard the country’s oil fields. Earlier, Pentagon Chief Mark Esper said the US troops would protect against Daesh, but also “deny” the oil from being taken by “other actors in the region,” including the Syrian government and Russia. This April 4, 2018 photo shows a convoy of oil trucks passinf a Kurdish police (Assayesh) checkpoint, as they moving fuel produced in Kurdish-held areas in the east to other areas controlled by the same U.S-backed group to the west, on a highway in Hassakeh province, Syria. Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2020, has been at the centre of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry against President Trump. The Democrats are accusing Trump of attempting to ‘get dirt’ on Biden after Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider restarting a corruption investigation into Biden’s son Hunter over his alleged illegal activities in Ukraine. Trump accused Biden of “bragging” about getting the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden fired, claiming this was an example of quid-pro-quo corruption. The Democrats are accusing the president of the same thing, claiming that he threatened to withhold $400 million in US military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky restarted the Biden probe. Democrats in the House of Representatives launched a formal impeachment probe against Trump in late September. He has denied any wrongdoing, and called the Democrats’ probe a political “witch-hunt,” “hoax,” and attempted “coup.” *Outlawed in Russia and many other countries. Loading...

    "articleText": "…from SouthFront The United States is to keep forces at the oil fields in Syria despite the troops’ withdrawal from the north of the country. The formal justification of the move is the need to “deny ISIS access” to the oil fields. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that the US military is already “taking some actions” to strengthen and reinforce their position in Deir Ezzor. This, Esper said, will include “some mechanized forces”. US military convoys already started entering Syria from Iraq and moving towards the US-controlled oil fields on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. The Pentagon provided few details regarding numbers of troops and equipment that will remain in the area. Media reports speculate that around 500 personnel reinforced with dozens of pieces of military equipment will be stationed there. For example, Newsweek reported that the US is seeking to deploy a half of an US Army armored brigade combat team battalion that includes as many as 30 Abrams battle tanks to the oil fields. The US is also going to keep its military garrison in the al-Tanf area, on the Damascus Baghdad highway, where about 150-200 troops remain. The version of the troops’ withdrawal from Syria that the media is trying to sell its audience says that the US is leaving the country. In reality, the US actions look more like re-deployment than withdrawal. Firstly, the withdrawal of “a majority of 1,000 troops” is hardly possible if, at the same time, 650-700 troops are to remain in the Deir Ezzor oil fields and al-Tanf. Secondly, the Trump administration, including the Defense Secretary, said that it was moving troops out of northern Syria, but not that they would be leaving the country. Trump himself described the withdrawal from Syria as a “process”. Thirdly, the US military convoys which left northern Syria during the active phase of Turkey’s Operation Peace Spring for western Iraq are now returning. Dozens of US military vehicles accompanied by fuel tankers entered Syria on October 26 and 27 alone. US forces also remained deployed at the Qasrak base on the Tell Tamr-Qamishli highway. Therefore, in the best case the US contingent is being reduced, while the rest of the forces just change their deployment area. The stance of Iraq, which at the highest level rejected the long-term presence of the US troops withdrawing from Syria to western Iraq, also played its own role. Some experts initially suggested that Washington could keep forces on the Iraqi side of the border to project military power to Syria while keeping the troop withdrawal promise at the same time. However, this plan caused too much resistance from the Iraqi government, which is already in much closer relations with Iran than the US has ever wanted. Another factor is money. The control of a part of Syrian oil does not impact the US economy in general. However, it does open particular prospects for the US campaign in the region and gives the Trump administration additional leverages of pressure on Syria and its allies. Before 2011, Syria had a lucrative oil industry, pumping about 400,000 barrels a day and having 2.5 billion barrels of reserves. The ensuing war and wide-scale Western sanctions devastated the country’s economy, cutting production by around 90% and forcing the Assad government to rely heavily on foreign imports of oil, mainly from Iran. The known oil reserves are mainly in the eastern part of the country near its border with Iraq and along the Euphrates River. The largest and most mature fields are the Omar and Jbessa fields, which reportedly had production capacities of 100,000 and 200,000 barrels a day, respectively, in 2010. This is the area where the US is planning to keep its military presence. It is estimated that around 75% of Syrian oil reserves are under the direct or indirect control of the US. A number of smaller fields are located in the center of the country, which is controlled by the Syrian Army, and in the country’s northeast, which is now under the joint control of the Syrian Army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). When the SDF and the US-led coalition seized the fields, the revenue from smuggling of Syrian oil was estimated at around $10 million a month with the price of around $30 per barrel. However, thanks to assistance from companies affiliated with US intelligence agencies and private military companies the oil output and thus revenue grew significantly. According to an October 26 report by the Russian Defense Ministry, the US military and private military contractors are now actively involved in protecting and managing oil smuggling in eastern Syria. The oil production itself is carried out using equipment provided by Western corporations bypassing all US sanctions. The oil exportation is implemented by the US-controlled company «Sedkab», created under the so-called Autonomous Administration of Eastern Syria, a political body created by the SDF, when US troops were deployed in northern Syria. The income from the smuggling goes through brokerage companies interacting with various accounts of US private military companies and US intelligence agencies. The Russian side says that the barrel cost of smuggled Syrian oil is $38 and estimates a monthly revenue for the US “business” involved in the operation of over $30 million. The business interests of US agencies and entities involved in the operation offer more reasons for the US presence in the area. It can be expected that if the situation in this part of Syria remains unchanged, the Trump administration will indeed go forward with its withdrawal “process” and more and more US troops will be replaced by US-linked private military contractors. Meanwhile US agencies and private military corporations will use revenue from the oil smuggling for further operations across the Middle East. Loading...

    "description": "by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio for VT italy “Each is subjected to the constituted authorities; since there is no authority except from God and those that exist are established by God.

    "articleText": "by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio for VT italy “Each is subjected to the constituted authorities; since there is no authority except from God and those that exist are established by God. Therefore he who opposes authority, is opposed to the order established by God. And those who oppose him will attract the condemnation. (…) Therefore it is necessary to be submissive, not only for fear of punishment, but also for reasons of conscience. For this reason, therefore, you must pay taxes, because those who are dedicated to this task are officials of God. Give each one his due: to whom the tribute, the tribute; to whom taxes taxes; to those who fear fear; to whom respect, respect”. It is evident that the Christian religious leaders of the Maronites of Lebanon and those of the Chaldeans of Iraq have completely forgotten the XIII letter to the Romans written by the apostle Saint Paul at a time when the oppression of the imperial centuries in Palestine was certainly well worse than that of the Lebanese and Iraqi governments today. Already the Messiah Jesus Christ sanctioned without space for objections “give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar”, at a time when taxes were starving the population well over now; further, in accordance with a logic of sacrifice and endurance which is the soul of the Gospel, he distanced himself from the Zealots who invoked the revolution. Instead, the proclamations of the Maronite and Chaldean bishops in favor of the popular uprisings are widely emphasized on the FIDES press agency of the Pontifical Mission Societies. Although the spiritual guides of the Shiite Muslims believe it was fomented by foreign powers for a total ousting of the Shi’ites themselves, because they Iran alies, from the centers of political power in the respective countries, from where they would have already disappeared had they not had the support of Tehran. THE SUPPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN HEADS TO THE REVOLUTIONS It is disconcerting to say the least that the religious authorities who call themselves Christians give their total support to street protests perpetrated with Molotov cocktails and indendiary barricades that are causing injuries and dead, especially in Iraq where last Wednesday even a katiusha missile was fired against the Green Zone of Baghdad killing a soldier of the Iraqi Security Force. But it is not that much if we remember that in recent days all the religious leaders of Turkey, including Christians, gathered in the monastery of Mardin to pray for the soldiers of the Turkish army and listen to the message of the Islamic dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan that through the Peace Spring operation it is carrying out a genocide against Kurdish enemies, despite several truce signed and repeatedly violated by Ankara and its jihadist mercenaries. Chaldean Christian Iraqi patriarchs who supported the revolution The Lebanese Maronite patriarchs pay tribute to “the people who expressed their unity” and ask to “embrace and protect the legitimate revolt of our children”, stressing the urgency “that power and government will respond to their national demands”. While, as Fides always reports, “the representatives of the various Iraqi ecclesiastical groups have declared that they share the requests of those who peacefully manifest their social discontent, and have thanked above all the young people who in expressing their protest towards the national political leadership, have they also “broke sectarian barriers, stated the Iraqi national unity and demanded that Iraq become a homeland for all”, based on the recognition of its plural identity “. It seems really difficult to believe that the religious leaders do not know who is behind these uprisings that are not sudden but cyclical and represent the same script implemented by the coup leaders of the triple alliance between Americans, Zionists and Sunni Islamists both in Syria and in Ukraine, to name only two of the most bloody conflicts. THE COUP OF THE CLOSED FIST OF CANVAS The evidence is flaunted without even a little shame on the Canvas website, the Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies which, under the guise of peaceful protests, is fueling the flames of social discontent in nations supported by governments considered enemies of the US, riots flare up skilfully driven by hackers who are generously funded by associations that sprout like mushrooms thanks to the cascades of dollars paid by the various American foundations for the export of democracy. The mosaic of international regime-change actions is so complex and fluid that it is only possible to analyze a few cards to confirm an international strategy of tension boasted by the same Canvas activists, highlighting successful operations, but not failed ones, and providing a weekly report on the riots they have organized. I leader di Canvas Srdia Popovic e Slobodan Djinovic Canvas can count on branched operational centers in many parts of the world but has its main office in Belgrade as it is the invention of the two Serbs Srdia Popovic and Slobodan Djinovic that after launching the Otpor (resistance) revolution for the dismissal of Slobodan Milosevic, at the same time that CIA and Saudi Arabia were financing the birth of the Caliphate of Europe in Bosnia as described in a previous report by Gospa News, before turning to the Rose Revolution in Georgia (2003), to the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon ( 2005) and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine “Pora” (It’s time!). read more THE EUROPEAN’S CALIPHATE The winning revolutions of Canvas celebrated on their own site There, despite to any spirit of non-violence, they did not hesitate to join the neo-Nazi militias to carry out the coup against President Viktor Janukovyc which culminated in the massacre of the Euromaidan square which caused the death of 70 maniacs and 17 police officers under fire of some mercenary snipers that a journalistic investigation revealed to be just Georgian … read more THE NATO UKRANIAN’S PLOT In the same Canvas website, explicit reference is made to the commitment still active in Venezuela but also and above all in Syria: it was the self-styled non-violent Belgrade organization that sowed the seeds of the revolution against Bashar Al Assad, thus laying the foundations for US military support for the Free Syrian Army (Esil or Fsa in English) and completing the CIA project already planned in 1983, as demonstrated by a document unveiled by Gospa News, against Hazis Al Assad, father of Bashar. read more THE CIA’S SECRET FILE ABOUT SYRIA US AGENCIES SUPPORTING GOLPISTS “When the United States wanted to overthrow a government, they had it secretly done to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), particularly when these governments had been democratically elected, like Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Chile (1973), Nicaragua (1980 ), Haiti (2006), Honduras (2009), Ukraine (2013) and Syria (2011) – writes British international columnist Davide William Pear – Over the past few decades, the United States has become more brazen in their regime projects change. What was usually done in secret is currently practiced without complexes for all to see. The 2017 change in Venezuela scheme is now in the public domain”. Canvas operations as they appear on their own site «The United States has perfected their regime-change techniques, disguising them as promoting democracy, funding subversion through the International Development Agency (USAID), the US Information Service (USIS) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) funded by the Congress, the International Republican Institute (IRI) and other selected non-governmental organizations» adds Pear. If today Syria, Lebanon and Iraq are still the target of the US it is only for the triple alliance between Washington, Tel Aviv and the Riad that sees the American Masons allied with the Sunni Muslims (Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) and the Muslim Brotherhood (Turkey, Qatar ) and with the Zionists of Israel in the project of destruction not only of Iran but of the same Shia religious ethnicity that holds power in the three countries today at the center of the clashes. read more NETANYAHU LIKE HITLER AGAINST SYRIA In Lebanon, after many years, the Cedar Revolution gave birth to a multi-religious government of peaceful coexistence, the Free Patriotic Movement (MPL) party of the Maronite Christian Michel Aoun, President of the Republic since 2016, the “8 March” coalition formed with the Shiite alignments of Amal by Nabih Berri and of Hezbollah led by Hassan Nasrallah, and the Sunni Muslim alignment Sa’ad al Hariri’s Future Movement, founded by his father killed in a car bomb attack. The insistent protests with the blocks of the highways have led the Sunni prime minister to resign creating a government crisis that will not be easy to heal. read more THE LEBANON POLITICS AND THE ISRAELI ATTACKS As anticipated, it would require a huge search to examine every single connection therefore, as proof of the activity of Canvas’s professional coup leaders, we will just tell the case of Lebanon thanks to a very detailed article by the Canadian analyst Ahmed Bensaada published in unsuspected times, in 2015, on the Italian site of geopolitical International Observatory for Rights presided by the lawyer and former magistrate Nicola Quatrano. REVOLUTION OF THE CEDARS AND OF THE TRASH The investigation analyzes the Cedar Revolution but also focuses on the failed Revolution of Trash. “The series of demonstrations that took place in Lebanon during the summer of 2015 was called by some a” waste crisis “, a revolution of “trash” by others. It was born due to a problem in the collection and management of garbage, but the protesters’ claims quickly spread and targeted the government, denouncing corruption and state inertia – writes Bensaada – The created civic collective in the course of the demonstrations it has taken the name of “You stinks!” (Tal3at Rihatkom, in Arabic). Short and striking name, perfectly recalls the protocol recommended by CANVAS. It is inscribed on the same line as Serbian “Otpor” (Resistance), “Kmara” Georgian (It is enough!) Or Ukrainian “Pora” (It is time!) “. “The dissident who represents the trait d’union between the Cedar revolution and that of the “junk “is certainly Michel Elefteriades, a sort of “missing link”of the revolutionary colored Lebanon. Ten years later, the one who was in close contact with the specialists of the non-violent resistance of CANVAS returns to the forefront of popular protest” adds the Canadian analyst, referring to the Greek-Lebanese musician, producer and businessman who was among the directors. of both insurrections but also the founder of “Harakat El Girfanine” (the disgusted movement “). It combines two distinctive signs of CANVAS projects: the movement logo with the closed fist of Otpor and the name that recalls that of the Sudanese cyber dissidents “Grifna” (we are disgusted). Michel Elefteriades and his Disgusted Movement with the closed fist of Otpor-Canvas “Although the multiple claims of the movement “You stink!” Express a real exasperation of the Lebanese people, it must be admitted that the inextricable relations between the leaders of the”junk”revolution and the various US export organizations of democracy are not irrelevant – highlights Bensaada – These latent connivances are the result of background work that preceded the Cedar revolution, which continued to the present day and which will certainly continue in the future. The Arab “spring” is its perfect illustration”. “All the more so if one thinks that Lebanon is a key country in the Middle Eastern equation because of its proximity to Israel, its geopolitical relations with the bloodless Syria and the presence of an element of strong irritation for Westerners: Hezbollah” reread after four years the analyst’s words of Arabic origin appear prophetic. “Both CANVAS and the various dissident movements of the Eastern countries or former Soviet Republics have benefited from the help of numerous US “export” organizations of democracy, such as the USAID (United States Agency for International Development), the NED ( National Endowment for Democracy), IRI (International Republican Institute), NDI (National Democratic Institute for International Affairs), Freedom House and OSI (Open Society Institute)” continues Bensaad’s analysis which then explains the dynamics of the contributions. The financier George Soros “These organizations are funded by the US budget or US private capital. For example, the NED receives congressional votes and the funds are managed by a Board of Directors in which the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the US Chamber of Commerce and the US American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial union are represented Organization (AFL-CIO), while the OSI is linked to the Soros Foundation, named after the founder, George Soros, the US billionaire, distinguished financial speculator”. THE LEBANESE ACTIVISTS TRAINED BY CANVAS The article shows that these same organizations have helped, trained and networked Arab cyber dissidents, protagonists of the famous “spring” that subverted their countries. «We also note the “footprints” of these organizations in the events of Tehran (Green Revolution, 2009) (5), Euromaidan (Ukraine, 2013-2014) and, more recently, in Hong Kong (Umbrella Revolution , 2014) – adds Bensaada – According to someone, the greatest success of CANVAS in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) was certainly Lebanon (Cedar Revolution, 2005) and Iran’s worst failure. What explains why Popovic proudly mentioned Lebanon as a trophy of his “revolutionary” game bag and did not say anything about Iran». Journalist Sharmine Narwani reported that Gebran Tueni, editor of the An-Nahar newspaper, was in contact with Frances Abouzeid, director of Freedom House in Ammam (Jordan) and on her advice invited CANVAS trainers to Beirut. «It is important to emphasize that Freedom House is the most important financier of the Serbian training center. The CANVAS Serbs trained Lebanese activists on the premises of the An-Nahar newspaper. Ivan Marovic, co-founder of CANVAS, has personally held training courses on non-violent resistance» explains the Canadian analyst. But to better understand the quadrant of the Middle East, three of the main protagonists of the Cedar Revolution must also be referred to: «The decision-making cell included a hard core of activists made up of three friends: Eli Khoury, a communication and marketing expert who works for Quantum and Saatchi & Saatchi, Samir Kassir, an essayist who directs the Democratic Left Movement (MGD), founded in September 2004 and journalist Samir Frangieh». LIBANIAN REVOLUTIONARY FRIEND OF ZIONISTS, SUNNITES AND SOROS In recent days, the InsideOver geopolitical column of Il Giornale has published an interview with Khoury, however without hinting at his dazzling career from New York to Dubai at just 55 years of age. After graduating from Beirut’s American University, he began working for BBDO, a company of the US global advertising group Omincom Group for which it follows advertising campaigns in New York, Los Angeles and London. In 2001 he moved to Dubai where he founded the news agency OMD (Optimum Media Direction) as the holding company. Just after the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon the Omnicom Media Group MENA (Middle East and North Africa) branch is established in the city of the United Arab Emirates, of which it becomes first director and then CEO in 2010. Its rise in the Arab media landscape it is contextual to its exclusive frequentations in the American jet set of the so-called Deep International State. Elie Khoury, protagonist of the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon and today CEO of the media holding Omnicom Group Mena based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates “We find the name of Eli Khouri on the list of guests at an international conference on “Democracy and security “, held in Prague (Czech Republic) from 5 to 6 June 2007. A meeting that saw many celebrities together in the field of dissidence, of espionage, politics and academia – always reveals Bensaada – During the conference, Khoury also had the opportunity to spend time with the Egyptian activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, with the Soviet dissident (currently Israeli), anti-communist and Zionist, Natan Sharansky and with the Russian opponent Garri Kasparov”. “But what is striking in this list is the large number of prominent participants from Israel; among them, the Israeli ambassador to the Czech Republic, Arie Arazi, and his Czech counterpart, Michael Zantovsky, the economic manager of the Israeli embassy in the United States, Ron Dermer, as well as many Israeli university students. And yet the highlight of the conference was undoubtedly the presence of President G. W. Bush, who took advantage of the opportunity to make a speech on freedom, democracy and political activism”. Taking a geographical leap it is good to remember, as highlighted by Gospa News in a previous report, that in the same year in Ukraine the first edition of the Kiev Security Forum was held, a security conference organized by Open Ukraine and financed by International Renaissance, arm Ukrainian of the New York Open Society of the Hungarian-American tycoon George Soros. read more THE SOROS ONG IN UKRAINE And just like the conference in Kiev, the one in Prague was also funded by Open Society International while it was organized by the “Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies” and by the “Prague Security Studies Institute” (PSSI) which could also boast among its advisers James Woolsey, former director of the CIA (and former chairman of the Board of Freedom House), and Madeleine Albright, the 64th US Secretary of State and, in her spare time, chairman of the NDI Board. read more THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST ASSAD As mentioned in the same article “Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies” is a research institute created with a generous gift of the “Adelson Family Foundation” (Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson). Its purpose is “to evaluate the global challenges facing Israel and the West” and to study issues related to the progress of democracy and freedom in the Middle East. Two authentic Zionist: Sheldon Adelson with Benjamin Netanyahu Sheldon G. Adelson is an American billionaire of Jewish origin and Ukrainian as a result Askenazita coem the founders of the International Zionist Movement). The main mission of its foundation is to “strengthen the State of Israel and the Jewish people”. According to journalist Nathan Guttman, Sheldon G. Andelson’s ideology is a set of support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sympathy for the settler movement and hostility towards the Palestinian Authority”. According the Canadian analyst, Eli Khouri points out, he was no stranger to the US administration. “The Wikileaks cable “06Beirut1544_a” reveals that about a year before this conference he was among the guests at a lunch offered by the US ambassador on the occasion of the visit by Kristen Silverberg, Secretary of State added to international organizations. Jeffrey Feitman points to Khouri as general manager of Saatchi & Saatchi (an advertising company) and describes him as an “advertising strategist and creative expert” who contributed to the “branding” of the Cedar revolution “which someone has sarcastically called” sponsored by USAID and by Saatchi & Saatchi ”. SAUDI AND EMIRATES ACCUSED FOR IRAQI COUP It would be interminable to dwell on the other innumerable details described in the Bensaada reportage which obviously gives great space to the cyber-activists of the so-called “Arab League of the net”. I therefore limit myself to pulling the strings in the light of the latest news stories reported by the Iranian website FarsNews, according to which «in the first round of public protests 3 weeks ago, the analyzes revealed that 79% of the hashtags on the protests in Iraq on Twitter they came from Saudi Arabia and only 6% came from Iraq, in stark contrast to the claims that the demonstrations were popular and spontaneous». Not only. “The al-Akhbar newspaper in Arabic wrote on Saturday that since Abdul Mahdi was charged with forming a government in Iraq and al-Fatah and Sa’eroun coalitions have gained the highest number of seats in the Iraqi parliament, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh have made various attempts to overthrow Abdul Mahdi’s government “. The article states that “the plot of the coup was designed in the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, adding that the United Arab Emirates was the” center for the management of the plan and a number of officials , including Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, national security adviser to the United Arab Emirates and his adviser Mohammad Dahlan (a Palestinian accused of ties to Israel) “, are responsible for planning the coup. According to Al-Akhbar and FarsNews Saudi Arabia would have invested a sum of 150 million dollars in the planning and implementation of the coup project and stated that the plot was implemented by the Iraqi civil society that receives financial support from the ‘American embassy. read more THE YEMEN WAR AND US NUCLEAR JOINT TO SAUDI The newspaper recalled the remarks made by the former Saudi ambassador in Baghdad Thamer al-Sabhan, who claimed that Iraq would be different in October, stating that al-Sabhan had guaranteed that a serious accident would shake the country’s political process. In light of its history in the Middle East, the Lebanese Khouri represents the perfect link between Lebanon and the USA, where in 2007 he founded the “Lebanon Renaissance Foundation” in Washington, and the United Arab Emirates where he held positions of national prestige. He became a member of the board of directors of Injaz-UAE, an organization dedicated to educating students about workforce readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy and START, a non-profit organization founded by Art Dubai and by the Al Madad Foundation. He was also a member of the board of directors of the United Arab Emirates chapter of the International Advertising Association (IAA) and in 2017, he was appointed a member of the board of directors of the United Arab Emirates subsidiary of Endeavor, the global non-profit organization which supports high-impact entrepreneurs. THE ARREST OF ISIS TERRORISTS AMONG THE REVOLTED Behind the protests in Lebanon as in Iraq, therefore, the ghosts of the communication guru of Dubai flutter like Belgrade activists, who for now only assume the paternity of the riots in Ukraine and Syria without the slightest attention to the catastrophic consequences of the civil lawsuits they have done beyond 10 thousand deaths in Donbass and more than half a million in the Arab country. Meanwhile in Iraq the social situation is increasingly incandescent, the dead after the start of the protests can be counted in the hundreds and among the chronicles of daily violence two rather disturbing episodes emerge. The arrest of some ISIS terrorists was reported by the Iraqi general Rashid Falih who denounced an alarming situation: “The ISIL terrorists have also created hiding places and safe houses, received a dollar salary and targeted forces police with Molotov cocktails”. While in recent days there would have been the massacre of over 35 protesters in Karbala. The conditional is obligatory because the police deny the news and in the hospitals 100 policemen and 22 protesters have been treated but there is no trace of the deceased. However, some eyewitnesses reported that the massacre was carried out by mysterious men wearing a black uniform but they were not identified either as policemen or as army soldiers. While waiting to understand if the massacre really happened, the thought quickly returns to the mercenary snipers of the Euromaidan square… Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio no reproduction without authorization ORIGINAL ITALIAN VERSION MAIN SOURCES FIDES – IRAQ FIDES – LIBANO ORGANIZZAZIONE DIRITTI – RIVOLUZIONI IN LIBANO FARSNEWS Loading...

    "articleText": "TEHRAN (FNA) – The Saudi security agency has recently sent a report to the Royal Court, warning against growing public anger over the secular moves made by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in violation of Islamic rules, a Saudi whistleblower revealed in a tweet. Al-Ahd al-Jadid, a Twitter account which discloses leaks from the House of Saud, claimed that it has recently gained access to a new security report to the Royal Court, where the ruling class has been cautioned against the consequences of public anger against Mohammed bin Salman’s so-called “reforms”.

In this regard, the Saudi security has recently sent a report to the Royal Court surveying the public opinion about the GEA’s actions, with examining comments in the society, remarks in parties, social media posts and the messages exchanged via Whatsapp messaging application. The report concludes that the society in Saudi Arabia is still supportive of Islamic traditions and the government has a difficult task in dealing and engaging with the Sahwa Movement (Awakening movement) and other Islamic trends. According to al-Ahd al-Jadid, the Saudi security apparatus has also conducted a survey among students of Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University and has found that the vast majority are strongly opposed to the decisions made by Mohammed bin Salman. “Students hold that the Saudi crown prince is a servile puppet of powerful countries and the UAE,” the findings showed. Among the measures of the GEA has been holding the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) women wrestling in Riyadh on Friday which sparked widespread controversies. The measures undertaken by GEA, which is a new entity founded in 2016 to implement bin Salman’s reforms for the 2030 vision, have so far sparked protests from many Saudi missionaries. The GEA measures are often considered against the norms, conventions and traditions of the Saudi society. Last month, Reuters reported that bin Salman had faced criticism from a number of Saudi royal family members who expressed frustration over Crown Prince’s ability to lead the kingdom following a devastating attack by the Yemeni forces on the Riyadh-owned oil sites. According to a senior foreign diplomat and five sources close to the ruling family, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, the raids by Yemen sparked anger among several prominent members of the Al Saud family and also some in elite circles who maintain the young crown prince has adopted an exaggeratedly aggressive foreign policy towards Iran. “There is a lot of resentment” about MbS’ leadership, said one of the sources, adding, “How were they not able to detect the attack?” The source also stated that some people in elite circles have “no confidence” in the crown prince, an assertion echoed by the four other sources and the senior diplomat. Several Yemeni drones targeted Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais in mid-September. The attacks shut down about 50 percent of the kingdom’s crude and gas production, and cut the state oil giant’s crude oil supply by around 5.7 million barrels per day. A return to normal production could take months, not weeks, according to reports. Some Saudi critics say MbS’s aggressive foreign policy towards Iran and involvement in the war in Yemen exposed the kingdom to attack, according to four of the sources with ties to the royals and business elite. They also express frustration that the crown prince was unable to prevent the attacks despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars on defense, according to the five sources and one of the senior diplomats. The crown prince, during a television interview aired on Sunday by US broadcaster CBS, stated that defending Saudi Arabia was difficult because of the kingdom’s large size and the scale of threats it faces. Saudi insiders and Western diplomats say the family is unlikely to oppose MbS while the king remains alive, recognising that the king is unlikely to turn against his favourite son. The monarch has delegated most responsibilities of rule to his son but still presides over weekly cabinet meetings and receives foreign dignitaries. Regardless of the king’s future, the insiders and diplomats say, a challenge to MbS’s authority could be difficult given his hold on the internal security structure. Some royals view 77-year-old Prince Ahmad bin Abdulaziz, King Salman’s only surviving full brother, as a possible alternative who would have support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, according to two of the five sources with ties to Saudi elite. Prince Ahmad has largely kept a low profile since returning to Riyadh in October 2018 after two and a half months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. One of the five sources with ties to the Saudi elite stated that Prince Ahmad’s position on whether he will challenge MbS is that he “will cross that bridge when we come to it”. The 34-year-old crown prince also came under international criticism over the murder a year ago of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Turkey’s Istanbul consulate, which the US Central Intelligence Agency has stressed the crown prince ordered.
