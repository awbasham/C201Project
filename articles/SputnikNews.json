    "title": "Increased Screen Time Linked to Lower Brain Development in Children - Study",
    "description": "Children who spend more time looking at screens have structural differences in their brains that are associated with lower language and literacy skills scores, a new study reveals.",
    "articleText": "The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics on Monday, was conducted by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. The participants consisted of 47 children (27 girls and 20 boys) between the ages of three and five. The participants underwent resonance brain imaging and cognitive testing, and their parents were asked to complete a survey regarding their children’s screen time, answering questions related to frequency, type of screen and content. The researchers found that children who used screens frequently had \"lower measures of microstructural organization and myelination of brain white matter tracts that support language and emergent literacy skills.” According to Better Brains for Babies, myelination is the process in which neurons are coated with myelin, an insulating layer or sheath that protects them. White matter refers to areas of the central nervous system consisting of myelinated axons (threadlike parts of nerve cells), which are also known as tracts. Children with higher screen time usage had lower myelination, lower brain white matter integrity and struggled more with expressive language, processing speed and other literacy skills than kids with lower screen time usage. \"This study raises questions as to whether at least some aspects of screen-based media use in early childhood may provide sub-optimal stimulation during this rapid, formative state of brain development,\" lead author of the study John Hutton is quoted as saying by Science Daily. \"While we can't yet determine whether screen time causes these structural changes or implies long-term neurodevelopmental risks, these findings warrant further study to understand what they mean and how to set appropriate limits on technology use.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children under the age of 18 months avoid screens altogether, other than for video-chatting. “Parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming, and watch it with their children to help them understand what they're seeing,” the AAP guidelines read. Meanwhile, children aged between two and five should “limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high quality programs.” In fact, an AAP report published last year recommended that doctors prescribe a daily dose of playtime for kids, noting that average playtime among US kids has dropped by as much as 25% during the last 30 years, while screen time has increased significantly. Hutton also pointed out that screen time among children is increasing not just at home, but also in other settings. \"Screen-based media use is prevalent and increasing in home, childcare and school settings at ever younger ages,\" Hutton said. \"These findings highlight the need to understand effects of screen time on the brain, particularly during stages of dynamic brain development in early childhood, so that providers, policymakers and parents can set healthy limits.\"",

    "title": "UK Flight Regulations Outdated, New Drone Rules Needed to Avoid 'Mischief' - Scholar",
    "description": "A new regulation has come into play in the UK meaning that drone pilots will now have until the end of November to register their craft with the Civil Aviation Authority.",
    "articleText": "Dr Gbenga Oduntan, Associate Professor in International Commercial Law at the University of Kent shares his views on the matter. Sputnik: Do you agree with the new drone ownership registration policy implemented by the British government? Dr Gbenga Oduntan: All means of transportation throughout history have had to have been regulated in one way or another. The regulation of air flights and instruments that can stay in the air dates back to 1784, when the first successful balloon flights took place, so there should be no vacuum in legislation because there would be mischief that will creep into this space. Definitely having some sort of licence regime is a good place to start; otherwise it could lead to more problems like we’ve seen in the recent past, such as the closure of Gatwick Airport, which was a great danger to human beings and commercial aviation. We cannot expect parliament to sit still and not do anything in the face of such a pressing development. Sputnik: Could drones ever be banned from public use? Dr Gbenga Oduntan: There’s a fine balance to be had and to be made between banning things outright and having regulated use. I would be more on the side of regulated use; we didn’t ban everybody from flying in airspace or owning aircraft, so that’s not what we should be doing for drones either. It just needs tighter regulation, even tighter than that of aeroplanes, because at least aeroplanes can be easily detected, they can be recovered after accidents, when needed we can track them down, they are big and can’t be concealed. Drones will get increasingly more sophisticated, they will get smaller and they will have more technological power packed into them, that’s the reason why regulations surrounding them should be tighter, but they shouldn’t be banned Sputnik: Should geographically close countries try and align their aviation laws? Dr Gbenga Oduntan: Let’s not forget, what one country does for drones is not the same as another, so we have to have co-operation on these developments, otherwise we will be unduly harsh on populations of nearby places, and there may be countries where you can do everything with drones, so I think going forward it’s more about international regulation, because I suspect that most of the mischief that drones will present, will actually come from international threats, rather than national ones.

    "title": "Plant-Based Diets, Population Control Among Climate Change Fixes Backed by 11,000 Scientists",
    "description": "Thousands of scientists from around the world have joined together to issue a global announcement saying that while the Earth is facing an urgent climate crisis, it could be alleviated if fewer people planned to procreate.",
    "articleText": "In an effort to carry out their moral obligation to “tell it like it is,” a total of 11,258 scientists from 153 countries issued a joint report on Tuesday which sounded the alarm on the Earth’s climate emergency and listed a number of methods by which those around the world can combat the growing epidemic. “We declare, with more than 11,000 scientist signatories from around the world, clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,” the scientists' Tuesday release in the Oxford University-published journal BioScience reads. The report proceeded to mince no words about the primary culprits for the problem. “The climate crisis is closely linked to excessive consumption of the wealthy lifestyle,” the article noted. “The most affluent countries are mainly responsible for the historical [Greenhouse Gas (GHG)] emissions and generally have the greatest per capita emissions.” While 24 countries and the European Union account for 91.8% of all CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption, the top three contributors are China, the US and the EU, contributing 28.4%, 15.5% and 10.4% to the emission total, respectively. As for across-the-board issues, the scientists claim the most “profoundly troubling signs from human activities” include a sustained increase in both human and livestock populations, the level of meat production per capita, global tree loss, the consumption of fossil fuels and the number of air passengers. Though the report lays out the usual ways to combat climate change such as developing renewable, clean energy sources, reducing methane emissions and increasing efforts to protect the oceans and coral reefs, it also offers solutions that are not likely to go over well with most modern-day people: population control and plant-based diets. Scientists who signed off on the report are encouraging people around the world to abandon beef and other meats and begin “eating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products.” Not only do the experts claim that this will boost human health and turn grazing land into cropland, but the change in diet would also decrease GHG pollutants such as methane. According to a 2018 study conducted by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and NGO Grain, the five leading meat and dairy corporations contributed more GHGs annually than major oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell and BP. While letting go of meat is a difficult request, decreasing the rate in which the Earth’s population grows may be an even tougher task. “Still increasing by roughly 80 million people per year, or more than 200,000 per day … the world population must be stabilized — and, ideally, gradually reduced — within a framework that ensures social integrity,” the scientists asserted. Just like there are secondary benefits to switching to a plant-based diet in the name of combating climate change, the experts say there are “proven and effective policies” that countries can put into place to not only lower GHG emissions and curtail loss of biodiversity, but also shrink the gender inequality gap through family-planning services that would establish “primary and secondary education as a global norm for all.” Despite likely opposition to come against the latest report, the options laid out provide a different take than previous climate reports from groups such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by offering concrete solutions to the world’s problems - which critics claimed climate activist Greta Thunberg’s efforts also lacked.",

    "description": "A reporter has been recorded condemning an ABC News decision to turn down her interview with an Epstein accuser years ago. The network claims the interview did not meet airing standards.",
    "articleText": "ABC News faced some inconvenient questions Tuesday about its decision to ditch interview with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts taken by Amy Robach three years ago after a video recording of Robach fuming about the network’s refusal was released online by Project Veritas. In the video recording, Robach can be heard expressing indignation about an editorial decision to not air the interview with Epstein’s accuser despite having the material years before Epstein came into mainstream media’s spotlight. “I’ve had the story for three years… we would not put it on the air,” Robach says. “It was unbelievable what we had, [Bill] Clinton, we had everything.” According to Robach, the network killed the story for several reasons. The editors first claimed that nobody knew at the time who Epstein was. Roback also suggested that the interview would smear Prince Andrew, and this fact became known to the UK Royal Palace, who then put pressure on the network. “We would not put it on the air. First of all, I was told, who’s Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story,\" Robach said on the video. \"Then, the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways. We were so afraid we wouldn’t be able to interview Kate and Will that we, that also, quashed the story.” She alleged that Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, pressed ABC into dropping the story. “I tried for three years to get (the interview) on to no avail and now it's coming out and it's like these 'new revelations' and I freaking had all of it,” she said, visibly exasperated. When contacted by Fox News, ABC downplayed the decision, saying that at the time the interview did not meet their editorial standards to be aired. “At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since, we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it,\" a network spokesperson told Fox News. ABC denied that external pressure influenced the editorial decision. The network said that continued investigation into Epstein led to the creation of a two-hour documentary and six-part podcast scheduled to air next year. It is unclear how much of Robach’s work will be represented. On Tuesday, Robach issued a statement acknowledging her interview did not meet the airing standards at the time. She also admitted the network never told her to drop her investigation into Epstein. \"The interview itself, while I was disappointed it didn't air, didn't meet our standards,\" Robach said on Tuesday. “As a journalist, as the Epstein story continued to unfold last summer, I was caught in a private moment of frustration. I was upset that an important interview I had conducted with [Epstein accuser] Virginia Roberts didn’t air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC’s editorial standards about her allegations.” \"In the years since no one has ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein, and we have continued to aggressively pursue this important story,” she added. © REUTERS / Jeenah Moon Watch: Hillary Clinton Laughs When Asked How She ‘Suicided’ Jeffrey Epstein Project Veritas, which released Robach’s emotional clip, is a private group that aims to “investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical and transparent society.” According to AP, the Project is notorious for sending undercover reporters to catch employees making statements that display political bias.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Two key features of the anti-terror law -- intercepted telephone conversations and admissibility of confession made before a police officer investigating a case -– will now be considered as evidence.",
    "articleText": "Having thrice failed to get presidential assent previously, a controversial anti-terror bill by the government in the Indian state of Gujarat was declared law on Tuesday by the region’s legislative assembly. Originally known as the Gujarat Control of Organised Crime (GUJCOC) Bill 2004, the proposed legislation was renamed the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GCTOC) Bill 2015. The new law retains a provision of empowering police to tap telephone conversations and submit them in court as evidence. Confessions made in the presence of police are now admissible in court and the probe period has been extended from 90 to 180 days before the filing of a charge sheet. Before the bill was declared law, the Gujarat's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faced stiff resistance in the legislature from the opposition Congress party over several provisions. The opposition eventually walked out of the assembly. The bill has been criticised by social activists who said it has \"dangerous implications\". The state government, however, justified it by claiming that current penal and procedural laws are inadequate to deal with organised crime. It may be recalled that former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had once objected to Section 14 of the Bill (telephone interception as evidence) in 2004 and returned it to the state government to remove the clause. On Tuesday, the bill was again introduced by Gujarat's Deputy Home Minister Rajnikant Patel, who said that its provisions favour the nation and allow law enforcement to take action against \"traitors\".",

    "description": "Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco is set to go public after multiple delays. The initial public offering, or IPO, of the world’s most profitable company, is expected to list on the Saudi stock exchange after state regulators approved the IPO request. But experts have raised concerns over its success.",
    "articleText": "“The biggest question is would the IPO go ahead as planned with two earlier failed attempts”, says Dr. Nafis Alam, an adjunct professor of finance at the department of business management at the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology in Surabaya, Indonesia, and a research affiliate with the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “The investors will be skeptical, given that there is no concrete evidence on the actual quantum of oil reserves in the Saudi, and especially how much Aramco has in its reserve”, he detailed. The company was forced to delay its IPO following a drone and missile attack in September that shut down half of its oil production. Riyadh pointed the finger at Iran, but Yemen’s armed Houthi political opposition faction claimed responsibility for the strike. According to Alam, geopolitical risks in the Middle East region will be another major concern for investors. Riyadh reportedly expects the IPO to value the oil giant at some $2 trillion, the largest such valuation in history, while the markets are suggesting $1.5 trillion. “The final value of the IPO will depend on how much demand there is from Saudi, regional and international investors, but it will be too early to determine the percentage of international investors versus local investors”, Alam noted. He added that the company is the kingdom’s crown financial jewel and the biggest investors are expected to come from the Middle East, especially the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, if the IPO goes as planned by the end of 2019 or early 2020. Plans for the IPO were first announced in 2016 as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 economic overhaul programme, aiming to diversify its oil extraction-based economy. “From the Saudi economy perspective, it might be one of the last resorts for the government to provide a lifeline to the ailing Saudi economy as the IPO can fetch in close to 40 Bln USD to boost the economic activity in the country”, Alam opined.

    "articleText": "The ambush attack reportedly occurred in daylight. Another six children were found alive, Fox News reported, adding that five were transported to a local hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. One child, however, is said to be missing and authorities have launched a search operation on the Sonora-Chihuahua border. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday offered assistance in the investigation, stressing that \"the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!\" ....monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2019 Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador during a news conference later in the day rejected Trump's offer to deploy US troops over the border to \"wage war\" on drug cartels. Obrador thanked Trump and \"any foreign government which wants to help\", adding that in such cases \"we have to act independently and according to our constitution, and in line with our tradition of independence and sovereignty\". \"The worst thing you can have is war ... We declared war, and it didn't work ... That is not an option\", Obrador said, cited by Fox News. Hours later on Tuesday Obrador said that he spoke with Trump and thanked him for his willingness to help, adding that he had assured the US president that justice would be done, according to Reuters. According to Fox News, the victims are believed to be members of the extended LeBaron family - with dual Mexican-US citizenship and were traveling back when they were ambushed. They reportedly lived in a religious community in La Mora, northern Mexico, a decades-old settlement in Sonora state founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around 70 miles south of Douglas, Arizona. Fox News said earlier, citing local authorities, that cartel gunmen may have mistaken the family's convoy for a rival gang. Local media claim, however, cited by Fox News that at least two members of the religious family, who could have opposed to local drug trafficking groups, were kidnapped an murdered a decade ago.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that New Delhi will not join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), as core concerns remain unresolved.",
    "articleText": "The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it will welcome India into the RCEP at an “early date” as Beijing will continue to work with all parties to resolve outstanding issues through negotiation. The statement came a day after India opted out of the deal after industrial sectors including dairy, pharmaceutical, chemical and textiles opposed the move suspecting that Beijing would use the pact to dump products at much lower cost. The Chinese ministry on Tuesday, however, claimed that Beijing does not pursue a trade surplus against India. Over the past five years, China's imports from India have increased an estimated 15 percent, according to reports. “The two sides should explore more ways and comprehensive measures to step up cooperation in investment, production capacity and tourism, making the pie even bigger and fostering balanced and sustainable trade relations,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang stated during a press briefing in Beijing. Geng stressed that the RCEP is an open initiative stating that, “once signed and put in place, it will help Indian goods to enter China's and other participating countries' markets as well. This is a two-way and complementary arrangement”. Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday stated that India is out of the trade agreement for now but is “open for further talks”. The Indian government earlier expressed concern over the rising trade deficit with China and other countries that constitute the RCEP. As per the commerce ministry document, India's trade deficit with RCEP nations has almost doubled, to around $105 billion in 2018-2019, in comparison to $54 billion in 2013-2014. Of India's $105 billion trade deficit with RCEP countries, China accounts for $53 billion. The RCEP comprises the 10-nation Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc as well as Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and China. The RCEP, once implemented, will create the world's largest trading bloc, accounting for about half of the world’s population, 25 percent of global GDP, and 30 percent of global trade.",

    "description": "A pilot for the Chinese airline Air Guilin has been grounded after a photo of a woman wearing civilian clothes sitting in the airplane’s cockpit while it was airborne went viral on social media, drawing widespread backlash.",
    "articleText": "The photo was first posted by the unidentified woman on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website similar to Twitter. It was identified by a Chinese aviation blogger on Sunday. The woman is seen making the V-sign with her fingers in the photo. Some media reports have claimed that the woman in the photo is in a romantic relationship with the pilot, but this has not been confirmed. Chinese state outlet People’s Daily has attested that the woman is a student at the Guilin Tourism University and is in training to be a flight attendant. — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) November 4, 2019 \"[I am] super thankful to the pilot! I am really so excited,\" the caption read, according to multiple reports. The original photo has since been taken down. In a statement Monday, the airline confirmed that the incident took place on January 4 on a flight from the Chinese city of Guilin to Yangzhou in China’s Jiangsu province. The statement added that the pilot, whose name was not revealed, has been grounded for violating aviation guidelines. In addition, several members of the flight crew have been fired in relation to the incident, although it is not clear what their roles were in it. \"We will enhance our rigorous safety guidelines, to avoid incidents like this from happening again,\" the statement also noted. Zhang Qihuai, deputy head of the Chinese Aviation Law Association, told the Global Times that the woman will face five days of detention in addition to a $284 fine. “Aviation safety comes first. No one can be careless, let alone break the law,” Zhang commented. The Global Times reported that the pilot has been suspended from flying for life. However, it’s unclear if that means that the pilot is suspended from flying with Air Guilin or all airlines. According to travel blog One Mile At a Time, most if not all airlines have rules against passengers visiting the cockpit due to safety reasons, especially following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The US Federal Aviation Agency has had a “sterile cockpit” rule since 1981 that bans pilots from participating in any distracting behavior during important parts of the flight, including take-off and landing.",

    "description": "A 28-year-old Maryland resident was fatally stabbed late Monday after getting into a dispute with a fellow customer at a Popeyes restaurant amid the ongoing craze over the establishment’s popular chicken sandwich, which the company recently resumed selling after a brief hiatus.",
    "articleText": "Citing Prince George’s County Police Department officials, local news station NBC 4 reported that the unidentified man was stabbed at roughly 7 p.m. local time at an Oxon Hill Popeyes, and that he died an hour after being transported to a nearby hospital. A preliminary investigation by police has revealed that an argument between the pair erupted after one of the individuals cut the other in a line specifically designated for customers interested in purchasing one of the sandwiches. The dispute later spilled outside of the eatery before turning deadly. By the time police arrived at the restaurant, the suspect had already fled the scene, and the victim was suffering from stab wounds. “Knowing these details and knowing what happened here and knowing that a life was taken, it is hard to put into words,” Jennifer Donelan, a spokesperson for the department, told the outlet. “I can’t find the right words ... to describe what this man did to this innocent victim.” The fast food chain issued a statement on the fatal stabbing after reports surfaced, saying, “We are very sad to hear about the tragedy in Maryland tonight.” “We do not yet know whether this was the result of a dispute over one of our products or something unrelated, but there is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot,” the release reads. “Our thoughts are with the victim’s family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities.” Police are calling for the suspect to turn himself over to law enforcement, and for community members to reach out to officials if they have any information regarding the incident. Prince George's County Police Chief Hank Stawinski held a news conference Tuesday, offering reporters new insight into the weekend altercation. At the event he noted that the deceased was the individual who was seen repeatedly cutting in line on surveillance footage, and that the stabbing occurred some 15 seconds after he was confronted by an upset customer. Officials also released a photo of the suspect wanted for questioning. — PGPDNEWS (@PGPDNews) November 5, 2019 Popeyes re-released the popular chicken sandwich on Sunday after it rapidly sold out at across the nation earlier in August. However, the Sunday altercation was not the first violent incident involving the restaurant's sandwich. Multiple reports have surfaced, detailing incidents in which Popeyes staff members have been threatened over the hot-ticket item. In fact, Houston Police responded in September to an incident in which a customer pulled a gun on staffers after they ran out of sandwiches.",

    "description": "Local researchers discovered a mysterious colony of ants, blocked from the outer world in the facility where the atomic weapons used to be kept. Although it consisted only of working ants, it did not only manage to maintain its self-organisation but also went in size.",
    "articleText": "Researchers in Poland have built an escape boardwalk to experiment with an ant colony that was discovered in an abandoned Soviet ammunition bunker to solve the mystery behind its growth. As the experiment showed, the ants, which had lived in complete isolation for years without an opportunity to leave, used the route to escape, leaving the dead bodies of their colony’s members behind. After zoologists studied the remains, they discovered bite marks and holes in the abdomen and other parts, which led them to the conclusion that cannibalism had helped the underground ants survive. According to the publication in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, the team from the Museum and Institute of Zoology and the Polish Academy of Sciences discovered the little inhabitants of the former nuclear weapons storage in 2013. They suggested that they might have fallen down there via a vent pipe from a colony above and become isolated. Checking up on them two years later, the researchers discovered that there were even more insects than before, with the population having gone up to hundreds of thousands, although the colony consisted of worker ants and could not procreate. The escape route was installed in 2016 to find out whether the hordes would use the opportunity to leave. © Sputnik / Игорь Подгорный Dracula Ant Crowned Fastest Animal on Earth – Report \"The survival and growth of the bunker 'colony' through the years, without producing own offspring, was possible owing to continuous supply of new workers from the upper nest and accumulation of nestmate corpses. The corpses served as an inexhaustible source of food which substantially allowed survival of the ants trapped down in otherwise extremely unfavourable conditions\", the researchers concluded, as cited by Newsweek.",

    "description": "An Iranian national working for the organisation was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison on espionage charges last year.",
    "articleText": "Iran's Intelligence Ministry has issued a statement declaring that any cooperation with the UK-based British Council, which Tehran believes is linked to the UK intelligence agency MI6, is banned and will be prosecutable. The ministry explained that it has been monitoring the activities of the organisation and was therefore able to act before it could do any damage to the Islamic Republic. \"The UK, which has a long history of infiltration, creating networks and generating propaganda in various countries, was planning to implement a project for cultural networking purposes in cooperation with the British Council in Iran\", the statement said. The ministry's statement didn't go into details about the purported activities that the British Council was planning to carry out in Iran, but noted that by banning the organisation, the intelligence body had prevented UK infiltration of the country's educational system. Back in 2018, Iranian authorities arrested a British Council employee, an Iranian national by the name of Aras Amiri, who was charged for cooperating with Britain's external intelligence agency the MI6 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Both Amiri and the British Council have denied the accusations. The organisation was forced out of the country back in 2009 and hasn't established an office in the Islamic Republic since. © Sputnik / Vladimir Fedorenko World cities. Tehran The British Council was originally established in 1934 with a dual purpose – to promote English language education and British culture abroad, while also combating the fascist ideology at the same time. The organisation has since been sponsored by the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Most Iranian media outlets indicate that the organisation is believed to be tied to the UK's secret intelligence service, the MI6. Iran is not the only country where the organisation has faced difficulties. The British Council’s offices in Russia were closed in 2007 at the behest of the country's Foreign Ministry. The order was issued due to Russian authorities uncovering that the organisation was violating Russia’s tax regulations.",

    "title": "Top Diplomat Sondland Revises Testimony, Says Ukraine Aid Withheld Over Probe Requests",
    "description": "On Tuesday, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland revealed for the first time that he had previously communicated to a top Ukrainian official that the Trump administration would likely withhold aid in the absence of its requested probe of former US Vice President Joe Biden.",
    "articleText": "In four new pages of sworn testimony to Congress released Tuesday but given the day prior, Sondland described how he laid out an understanding of quid pro quo to Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: US aid to Ukraine could be at risk if Kiev didn't publicly commit to the Trump administration's requested investigation of Biden. Sondland's testimony was based on a review of other depositions given to a slew of House committees heading up the impeachment inquiry into US President Donald Trump by William Taylor, the charge d'Affairs for the US embassy in Kiev, and Tim Morrison, a top official on the National Security Council. \"Ambassador Taylor recalls that I told Mr. Morrison in early September 2019 that the resumption of US aid to Ukraine had become tied to a public statement to be issued by Ukraine agreeing to investigate Burisma. Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I had conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence's visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky. Mr. Morrison recalls that I said to him in early September that resumption of US aid to Ukraine might be conditioned on a public statement reopening the Burisma investigation,\" Sondland's declaration states. In 2016, as Biden later boasted, the then-vice president himself pressured the Ukrainian government, via aid withholding threats, into ending then-Special Prosecutor Vyktor Shokin's anti-corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, an oil and gas company doing business in the Ukrainian sector on the board of which Hunter Biden, the vice president's son, sat at the time. Shokin was fired by Kiev shortly thereafter, ending the probe. READ: Sondland submitted this amendment to his testimony, saying other witnesses refreshed his recollection tha tmilitary aid was withheld as part of Trump's push to get a Biden investigation going. pic.twitter.com/AnQsm0P2Ag — Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) November 5, 2019 Sondland noted that, while in his previous testimony, also released on Tuesday but conducted on October 17, he claimed to have told Taylor there wasn't to be a quid pro quo from Trump, reading Taylor's and Morrison's statements \"refreshed my recollection about conversations involving the suspension of US aid.\" Other Transcripts Released Several other transcripts and phone call recordings were released on Tuesday by the chairs of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees, including testimony by former US Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. In a statement accompanying the release of the transcripts, Intelligence chair Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs chair Eliot Engel and acting Oversight and Reform chair Carolyn Maloney said that with the new revelations, \"the president's scheme comes into clearer focus.\" “The testimony of Ambassadors Volker and Sondland shows the progression of efforts by the President and his agent, Rudy Giuliani, to use the State Department to press Ukraine to announce investigations beneficial to the President’s personal and political interests,\" the joint statement reads. “It is clear from their testimony that, in exchange for the statement, President Trump would award the Ukrainian president with a highly coveted White House meeting and, later, with millions of dollars in critical military aid being withheld.\" “Finally, with the release of the full production of text messages provided to the Committees by Ambassador Volker, and an additional declaration by Ambassador Sondland, the President’s scheme comes into clearer focus,\" they said. Volker's testimony, given on October 3, notes that he believed that Biden pressuring Kiev to fire Shokin \"was widely understood internationally to be the right policy.” The former envoy also described the growing involvement by Giuliani, Trump's lawyer who holds no government office, in US-Ukraine affairs, positioning himself as someone who could give Ukrainian officials a more direct connection to Trump's ear than embassy diplomats. He also noted his attempts to convince Giuliani and his associates that the allegations against Biden were “simply not credible.\" He described Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskyy, which helped fuel the impeachment inquiry, as “quite a surprise,” “extremely unfortunate” and “explosive.”",

    "description": "The US Marine Corps (USMC) has awarded BAE Systems a $120 million contract that seeks to acquire 30 new Amphibious Combat Vehicles (ACV) - marking the service’s third bulk order of the vehicle ahead of upcoming operational tests.",
    "articleText": "BAE Systems Land & Armaments Inc., a US-based subsidiary of Britain’s BAE Systems, announced last week that, along with IVECO Defense Vehicles, it had reached “an important next step” for the full-rate production of its “ACV personal carrier variant (ACV-P)” for the USMC after receiving a $119,938,228 contract from the military branch. “This award further validates the Marine Corps’ confidence in the vehicle’s proven capability in meeting their amphibious mission, and represents an important step toward fielding the vehicle in the Fleet Marine Force,” John Swift, BAE Systems’ director of amphibious programs, said in the October 30 release. “The ACV is a highly mobile, survivable and adaptable platform designed for growth to meet future mission role requirements while bringing enhanced combat power to the battlefield.” According to the release, the ACV-P is an eight-wheeled assault vehicle “capable of transporting Marines from open-ocean ship to shore and conducting land operations.” This particular variant is designed to carry up to 16 people - three crew members and 13 passengers. While the company plans on expanding the latest generation of the ACV family to include variants with command and control systems (ACV-C), 30-millimeter turrets (ACV-30) and recovery upgrades (ACV-R), the ACV-P is the primary focus at the moment during low-rate initial production (LRIP). Military.com reported BAE Systems was instructed to not disclose how many vehicles would be delivered to the USMC as part of the agreement. However, an October 29 contract announcement from the US Department of Defense noted the nearly $120 million in funds were designated “for the purchase of 30 Amphibious Combat Vehicles.” This contract marks the USMC’s third award to BAE Systems and IVECO since it first began to acquiring the ACV-P through LRIP in 2018. The DoD also revealed the 30 ACVs would be delivered by January 2022. Prior to their delivery, the USMC will launch the initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) stage in July 2020 to assess the vehicle’s usefulness and ability to replace the Marines’ aging Assault Amphibious Vehicle, which has been in service since 1972. “IOT&E is sort of like a dress rehearsal for the system. Marines will operate the vehicle in realistic environments and go on realistic missions so that we can evaluate the operational suitability and effectiveness of the system and see if it does what we want it to do in the way we want to do it,” Maj. Scott Jennings of the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity authority said in an October 3 USMC release.",

    "description": "Jakarta is exploring the possibility of buying two squadrons of advanced F-16V Viper fighter jets from Washington, the Indonesian Air Force’s chief of staff said recently. News of the potential deal follows neighbor Taiwan’s purchase of dozens of the jets.",
    "articleText": "\"Insya Allah [God willing], we will buy two squadrons in the next strategic plan 2020-2024. We will purchase the newest type of Block 72 Viper,\" Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff Marshal Yuyu Sutisna stated at the Roesmin Nurjadin Airbase in Pekanbaru on October 28, the country’s state-owned Antara News reported. However, with Indonesia having an entire defense budget of just $7.6 billion for FY 2020, it’s unclear where the money could come from. Taiwan’s recent purchase of 66 Vipers set the autonomous island back $8 billion, Sputnik reported. That comes out to $121.2 million per aircraft, including training, support, spare parts, and other accoutrements that Jakarta would likely also require. However, at this stage it’s unclear how many jets they may wish to purchase. Defense News noted the Indonesian Air Force already flies the earlier F-16C and D models, which date to the 1990s but were bought from the US Air Force and Air National Guard in 2011. The advanced F-16V, which comes from the Block 72 upgrade, is among the latest iterations of an interceptor first introduced in the 1970s and includes an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The General Dynamics-built plane has grown to fill a variety of roles, including ground attack, and served as the standard export fighter to dozens of US allies. Indeed, Yuyu noted that \"many countries are using this jet fighter, which proves its reliability.\" The air force chief also noted the country was “in the process of buying jet fighters from the east, the Sukhoi 35.” Sputnik reported in October 2018 that the long-pursued deal could earn Jakarta sanctions from the United States under that country’s Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which elaborates punishments for countries that buy advanced weapons from Russia in an effort to deter them from doing so. However, many nations have balked at the CAATSA threat, deciding that Russian-made jets, air defense systems and other equipment were more valuable. Russia will sell 11 of the jets, which are heavily upgraded Su-27s, to Indonesia for $1.154 billion. Indonesia’s Air Force also operates Russian-made Su-27SKs and Su-30MK2s.",

    "title": "Integrity Initiative: Psywar Institute Defanged, But British Spies' Disinfo War Still Rages",
    "description": "In December 2018, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) launched an official inquiry into the Institute for Statecraft, the parent organisation of shadowy and controversial UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office programme Integrity Initiative.",
    "articleText": "A month earlier, international hacking syndicate Anonymous released a batch of internal files it'd appropriated from the Institute’s servers. The material was explosive and troubling in the absolute extreme, revealing the ‘charity’ - which had received millions in funding from the British state and NATO, among others - to be an international information warfare effort run by military intelligence specialists, which had disrupted the domestic politics of several countries and smeared progressive politicians at home. Almost immediately, concerned members of the public – myself among them – began filing complaints about the Institute and Initiative to the OSCR. My first was prompted after learning the organisation fraudulently listed a crumbling, derelict building in a remote part of Fife, Scotland as its principal office address, when in reality it’d never operated from there. Shady goings on in deepest, darkest Fife. The HQ of the Institute for Statecraft..... pic.twitter.com/FKNAZjAPdh — ghengis888 (@ghengis888) December 9, 2018 The location of the Institute's actual headquarters – Two Temple Place, Central London – was provided to me by former British Ambassador Craig Murray. There was nothing directly linking any of the Institute’s named directors or trustees to the address, and it wasn’t clear who or what was paying the presumably sizeable rental fees or utility bills - Murray told me that based on his diplomatic experience, these were strong indications the building had been provided to the Institute by British intelligence. So it was I visited the organisation’s covert nerve-centre 11th December 2018. While I was rapidly and aggressively ejected, two days later the OSCR instituted its probe, using powers under section 28 of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 – and the organisation was figuratively forced by law to open its doors to the public. No Public Benefit The OSCR’s findings have now been published, and they make for at-times shocking reading. Strikingly, it seems the deeper investigators delved into the Institute’s internal workings, the more alarmed they became – an experience I can certainly emphathise with. In the most damning report I've seen from a charity regulator @ScotCharityReg rules that Fife-based Institute for Statecraft was effectively a sham charity that committed multiple breaches. IforS controlled failed propaganda entity the Integrity Initiative https://t.co/uZlaSQZL0o pic.twitter.com/YasQRXhCtU — Ian Fraser (@Ian_Fraser) November 4, 2019 Initially, the inquiry focused on if and how the Institute’s activities, particularly Integrity Initiative, furthered its charitable purposes, whether the organisation was complying with its duties under the 2005 Act, and the publication of “politically biased” material by the Initiative’s Twitter– a reference to the account publishing a number of posts attacking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, in direct contravention of state funding rules. However, as the investigation progressed, “further concerns emerged” - such as whether the Institute’s activities were “entirely charitable”, whether trustees were consciously seeking improper financial benefit from its operation and truly acting in the organisation’s interests, “with the appropriate level of care and diligence”. “We found evidence both the [Institute] was failing to meet the charity test set out in the 2005 Act, and trustees had breached their duties, some of them to a serious extent,” the report summary states. An organisation can be classified a charity in Scotland if it serves one or more of 16 charitable purposes listed in the 2005 Act, and/or “provides or intends to provide public benefit in Scotland or elsewhere”. However, the OSCR found the Institute listed “[advancing] national and international security” as its key objectives, which isn’t a charitable purpose as defined in the 2005 Act, implying the organisation was far-removed from being a charitable organisation for all its time of operation prior to the probe. It’s left unexplained how and why the regulator missed this fundamental failing before the Institute was approved for the Scottish Charity Register in 2006, and neglected to notice or request the organisation amend or remove the entry from its governing document at any point prior to the investigation. Still, the OSCR also identified “a number of concerns” about Integrity Initiative, chief among them the enterprise’s activities not being “in furtherance of a charitable purpose”. We Don't Need No Education? In discussions with OSCR representatives, Institute trustees somewhat astoundingly argued the Initiative advanced the charitable purpose of “[advancing] education in the ﬁelds of governance and statecraft, in particular focusing on the leadership, direction, management and administration of public and private institutions, major organisations and other bodies, and the skills needed by those in authority within such institutions, organisations or bodies to enable them to deal effectively with current and future challenges, particularly in respect of security”. The OSCR was thoroughly unconvinced by the highfalutin, finding the explanation “difficult to reconcile with statements made by the charity in published documents and to third parties”, which consistently describe the Initiative as “being set up to ‘track, expose and counter disinformation and malign influence’”. Amusingly, while acknowledging increasing understanding of “disinformation, fake news and other areas of influencing by state actors and others” could further charitable purposes, the OSCR ruled the Initiative’s activities neither “[increased] learning and knowledge of a subject matter among members of the public” nor furthered the Institute’s charitable purposes, and thus “failed to provide public benefit”. Moreover, Scottish charity rules state when an organisation provides education on a “controversial issue”, it must do so in a manner allowing those being educated “to make up their own minds” – and the OSCR concluded the Initiative “expressed a particular perspective intended to persuade the public to a specific point of view” which was “not sufficiently neutral”. In other words, the regulator confirms what so many have well-understood ever since the Institute’s internal files first leaked - far from objectively informing citizens in defence of democracy and truth, Integrity Initiative seeks to propagandise and misinform in service of particular financial, political, military and ideological interests. The OSCR also expressed concern about the Initiative’s assorted international ‘clusters’ - collectives of politicians, businesspeople, military officials, academics and journalists who covertly spread (dis)information via news and social media and can be mobilised to influence policy and perceptions, among other things – which were likewise and unsurprisingly found not to provide public benefit or further educational purposes. Investigators also unsurprisingly found no evidence the Initiative’s Twitter account furthered any charitable purpose or had prior to the end of 2018 been subject to “sufficient control or oversight”, ruling Institute staff “failed to recognise the risks involved in using social media” to publish “party political comment” – although a cynic might argue they were fully aware of such hazards, but were intensely unconcerned, and published partisan comment as a matter of internal policy. Get Rich Quick Under the 2005 Act, any “private benefit” (ie personal enrichment) garnered by a charity’s trustees must be incidental to their activities, an inadvertent but necessary by—product of an organisation’s activities, not an end in itself. The OSCR was clearly mortified when it scrutinised this aspect of the Institute’s operations, but precisely why is somewhat unclear. “We were concerned at the level of private benefit a number of the [Institute’s] trustees were gaining from the exercise of its functions. There was no clear explanation as to why salaries being paid to trustees were considered reasonable and necessary, and we had concerns about trustees’ decision-making around these payments. We don’t consider this private benefit was incidental to the organisation’s activities [or] advanced its purposes,” the report states. What this section seemingly implies is trustees specifically sought to make a mint for themselves from the Institute’s activities, and made organisational decisions explicitly and primarily on this basis. If so, that’s hardly surprising – for trustees Chris Donnelly and Dan Lafayeedney, who cofounded and run the Institute, have set up a number of potentially suspect charities and commercial ventures in their time, at least some of which seem to serve little purposes other than siphoning government money. Among these ventures are several Scottish Limited Partnerships, vehicles certifiably oft-used for nefarious purposes - in April 2018 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy stated there was \"growing evidence SLPs have been exploited in complex money laundering schemes” and “abused to carry out all manner of crimes abroad – from foreign money laundering to arms dealing\". While these endeavours aren’t provably dubious or illegal, Lafayeedney’s business dealings have previously been investigated by the Inland Revenue, and landed him in the High Court in 2006. In the latter case's ruling, the presiding judge savagely indicted his “lack of credibility”, and stated “there were certain specific matters…where I am bound to conclude Mr. Lafayeedney was not telling me the truth”. In any event, other sections of the OSCR report are far more opaque in indicting the Institute. Elsewhere, the OSCR expresses concern trustees “in a number of areas…failed to act with required levels of care and diligence”, for example in respect of “recording key decisions and actions of trustees”, which investigators ruled to have been consistently poor, “and at times appears non-existent”. Through their 'Integrity Initiative' project, the Institute for Statecraft − a state-funded charity − conducted a number of shady activities, like smearing Jeremy Corbyn. This requires a public inquiry. Watch what happened when I visited their London office earlier this year. pic.twitter.com/42LOIhFcDO — Chris Williamson MP #GTTO (@DerbyChrisW) May 20, 2019 The Institute was unable to produce records of how or when key decisions were taken, with a “lack of formal decision-making” identified throughout the organisation’s 12-year existence. While the Institute argued this reflected the organisation’s “small scale” and the fact all trustees “worked closely and informally together”, the OSCR are very clear that recording of trustee decisions is an obligation for all charities regardless of size. “Most seriously” though, there was no evidence trustees “as a whole” discussed whether the activities of Integrity Initiative “would advance the charity’s purposes”, or decisions about accepting and seeking funding for the Initiative were ever discussed formally by trustees. Investigators also identified evidence of a “lack of challenge” on the part of some trustees. Again, readers are left somewhat in the dark as to the specific source of the OSCR’s assorted grievances here. Beyond not stating the specific decisions and examples of “lack of challenge” to which it refers, is the regulator insinuating the Institute deliberately and duplicitously sought to leave no paper-trail, and keep all its activities secret? Or that key the Institute’s organisational decisions are exclusively made by certain individuals – Donnelly and Lafayeedney, for instance – without consultation? The latter interpretation would of course suggest many trustees are entirely subservient and merely appointed for show – and perhaps to line their pockets – in order to meet the OSCR’s charity classification requirements. Tantalisingly, a section at the very end of the report, ‘Learning points for the wider sector’, appears to euphemistically reinforce both interpretations. For one, it reminds all charity trustees they “must take an active part in making decisions in the charity’s interests, and challenge other trustees when they need to”, as “merely deferring to the opinions and decisions of others will make it hard for a trustee to fulfil their duties”. Moreover, trustees “should ensure the decisions they have taken are clearly recorded” and “decisions on paying charity trustees for services to the charity are taken appropriately in the light of OSCR guidance”. Long Goodbye The report reaches an exasperating zenith when discussing what the OSCR intends to do about the Institute’s iniquitous litany of highly suspect and dishonest, if not outright illegal, behaviour – for its investigators bafflingly concluded it wasn’t “necessary or proportionate” to take any formal action whatsoever, although pledge to keep a close eye on the Institute’s activities and governance moving forward. The rationale for this negligent passivity is the Institute “taking action to meet the charity test” after the OSCR dispatched a letter in August 2019 setting out its interim findings, and directing trustees to take steps to address the numerous issues identified, on threat of removal from the Scottish Charity Register. Nonetheless, the changes undertaken by the Institute are fairly seismic. From now on, no trustees will be remunerated, and a certain number of as yet unnamed trustees will stand down as soon as replacements for them are found – trustees no longer reaping salaries from their positions will almost certainly encourage departures, of course. It’s unknown whether the resignations of trustees Harry Hart– a resident of Switzerland, whose father David served as an adviser to Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s – and Philip Matthews – director of PM Homeland Security and former director of Astutus Intelligence – in February and May 2019 respectively is in any way connected to the OSCR probe. To bring things full circle, the report also notes the Institute’s principal office address has been updated on the Scottish Charity Register – although the listing still doesn’t reflect the organisation’s true location. Rather than Two Temple Place, the entry states the Institute operates from 1 Rutland Place, Edinburgh – the headquarters of law firm Anderson Strathern. Intriguingly, Anderson Strathern is listed as a director of Douglas and Angus Estates, one of Scotland’s largest landowners, which was established by David Douglas-Home until 2013 chairman of Coutts & Co. – the private bank favoured by private intelligence company Hakluyt. The company is staffed overwhelmingly by former MI6 officers, and many, including British parliamentArians, have alleged it serves as a deniable front for the activities of UK intelligence services. It may be pure coincidence Burness LLP, the law firm which established the Institute in 2006, also set up Hakluyt a decade prior – but this admittedly tenuous linkage could be significant, given the Institute has also ceased all activity related to Integrity Initiative, and responsibility for running the endeavour has now been handed to “a non-charitable entity” with “no legal connection” to the Institute. It’s as yet unclear who and/or what has taken over the reins, and whether it’ll continue to operate under the same, irreparably tarnished name – but the Institute and Initiative respectively both have former intelligence staff in their ranks, including Institute Chief Operating Officer Guy Spindler, and Harold Elletson, coordinator/point-man of the Initiative’s German cluster, both veteran MI6 operatives. © AFP 2019 / CHRISTOF STACHE Damaging Ties: Why Germany is the Integrity Initiative’s 'Most Important Target' Whatever the truth of the matter, that the Institute is apparently no longer in charge would seem to confirm my assumption, outlined in July, the Initiative is heavily involved in Open Information Partnership. As I exclusively revealed then, the enterprise is an insidious Whitehall-funded “disinformation factory” seeking to influence politics and perceptions “in countries of particular interest to the FCO”. Clearly then, while the UK government has lost one informational battle, its war on democracy and the public mind not merely at home but worldwide continues apace – and the threat Integrity Initiative posed to democracy and peace hasn’t gone anywhere, merely reorganised and regenerated in other, more insidious and clandestine forms. It’ll be fascinating to see who steps down from the Institute, and where they go and what they do next – but it’s almost certain that somewhere in a shadowy corner of Britain’s myriad corridors of power, Donnelly and his sinister underlings are concocting fresh plans to corrupt the public mind. In fact, with a General Election looming, and the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party seizing power, it’s unquestionable.",

    "description": "Currently, some military information is protected by the law on state secrets. However, security experts point out that this legislation doesn’t address all the loopholes.",
    "articleText": "The Russian government plans to introduce the notion of military secrets, Izvestiya newspaper reported, citing sources in the Defence Ministry. Former KGB General Boris Kurdiumov said that the resurrection of a Soviet law is necessary due to the rise in leaks of classified information. “The situation on the geopolitical arena is tense now and many countries want to obtain our secrets. Unfortunately there have been many leaks. Very often the West gets information about Russia’s new armament right after the weaponry is sent to military bases or after the military has tested the new equipment”, Kurdiumov said in an interview with Izvestiya. Under the new law, information about the location of military forces, their composition, assignment and armament, as well as their designation and force structure, will be classified. At the moment, this information is protected by the law on state secrets, but it doesn’t address all the intricacies of military information. For example, the law on state secrets doesn’t protect information that is qualified as confidential or “for internal use”. Hence Russian authorities cannot prosecute individuals who have disclosed this data. The Defence Ministry said it is examining all legal aspects and nuances while preparing documents for the future law. The ministry noted that the legislation’s requirements would extend only to servicemen. Individuals that would be granted access and would work with classified information will receive privileges, while violation of the law would amount to criminal offence. Russia abolished the Soviet-era law on military secrets in the 1990s and replaced it with the law on state secrets. In the Soviet Union, individuals were punished with up to ten years in jail for disclosure of classified information.",

    "articleText": "Washington Nationals pitcher and most valuable player of the World Series 2019 Stephen Strasburg has returned to his long-dormant Twitter account in order to comment on a viral video where it looks like he refused to shake hands with US President Donald Trump during the Nationals' recent visit to the White House. The athlete reposted the video, simply adding the hashtag #FakeNews. #FakeNews https://t.co/ovDuHyRUTb — Stephen Strasburg (@stras37) November 4, 2019 What was fake about the footage? While Strasburg was of few words in his comment, he was apparently referring to a post published by sports observer Rudy Gersten containing the edited viral video along with the words \"Strasburg left Trump hanging\". The footage was skilfully edited and only shows how the athlete turned to hug his team's manager, Dave Martinez, appearing to ignore Trump's handshake offer.

    "description": "The Solar System’s biggest planet might have helped make Earth liveable, preventing it from drifting out of orbit, scientists concluded after creating a simulation. According to the researchers, such interactions could be a clue to finding life on other planets.",
    "articleText": "1. Playing With Gas Giant 2. Could This Help Us Find Aliens? An international team of astronomers has introduced a new tool that could bring humankind closer to finding habitable exoplanets, their paper submitted to The Astronomical Journal suggests. Could our neighbouring giant be helpful in the search for alien worlds? The answer is affirmative, thanks to its gravitational pull. According to the researchers, they created a suite of simulations of the Solar System that have shown how the slightest change to its architecture could impact Earth’s orbit, which is one of the key factors for life on it. To test how our system’s largest planet, Jupiter, with its huge gravitational pull influences its neighbours, including Earth, the scientists started moving the gas giant. Playing With Gas Giant Playing dice with the Solar System helped the researchers find that it was quite easy to make it unstable, the study’s leading author Jonathan Horner told ScienceAlert. \"In about three quarters of our simulations, as we move Jupiter around, we put it in places where, within 10 million years, the Solar System fell apart. The planets started crashing into each other and being ejected from the Solar System\", he revealed. While they varied the orbit of Jupiter, they kept the initial orbits of the other planets constant to find out whether even slight changes could alter Earth's orbital evolution, which played a key part in the so-called Milankovitch cycles of climate change. Could This Help Us Find Aliens? Apart from proving that if it were not for this particular balance in the Solar System, then the Earth might be unbearable to live on, their experiments moving Jupiter may be crucial in hunting for habitable exoplanets. As the researchers noted in their publication, their finding runs counter to the “Rare Earth” hypothesis, which posits that the conditions on Earth are too unique to be repeated by any other planet anywhere else in the universe. While they predict that a wealth of Earth-sized exoplanets will be discovered in the coming years, they point out that their models of the particular architecture might be useful for selecting the best candidates from among them. “Our results highlight how dynamical simulations of newly discovered exoplanetary systems could be used as an additional means to assess the potential targets of biosignature searches, and thereby help focus the search for life to the most promising targets”, they concluded.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): The Pakistani Navy successfully launched a land-to-sea anti-ship missile from a fast attack craft in the North Arabian Sea on Tuesday, Pakistan military’s media wing said.",
    "articleText": "A Navy official said that the missile hit its target accurately, which was witnessed by Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi. “Naval Chief appreciated the efforts of relevant units, scientists and engineers to make this missile testing a success”. Pakistan did not reveal the missile type tested on Tuesday, but it could be a naval version of the Babur, which is based on the Babur 1B (also designated as Hatf VII). The missile was last test-fired in April 2019. The test was conducted a day after Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa expressed firm resolve to defend the country from a full-spectrum threat. Indian defence scientists have also planned a series of tests of its nuclear-capable missiles, such as the K4 submarine-launched missile, as well as the Agni 2, Prithvi, and Brahmos supersonic cruise missile in the coming days. As per the Indian media report: “Preparations are on in full swing for the tests…The focus will be on the performance of K-4 and Agni-II as both the missiles will be put to tests with new advanced systems”. The long-range (3,500 km) K-4 missiles have so far been tested four times successfully from underwater pontoons. On 30 September, the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos supersonic cruise missile was test-fired successfully with an Indian propulsion system, airframe, and power supply. These tests came against the backdrop of persistent firing at the border for the last three months after New Delhi abrogated the special status granted to the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir on 5 August. Despite firing from heavy artillery, the two nuclear-armed nations are doing little to deescalate their border conflict, and the situation on the ground appears to be worsening with each passing week.",

The boys kept the burger for their friend, but he didn't show up, so they say they \"still have the burger\". What started as a joke turned into a very popular thing in 2015, when they discovered the burger - and it still looked the same. The two posted photos and videos of the burger online, resulting in it going viral. The burger even has its own website and a Tinder profile, although these were closed as it took too much time to answer all the responses, reports say. \"It's as hard as a rock\", Casey Dean said, adding that it has never smelled at all. Prior to this, another old burger from McDonald's, which is on display in Iceland, became very popular, as it celebrated its 10th birthday last week, according to reports.",

    "description": "According to the conditions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, the country can't enrich Uranium above 3.67%. But Tehran started to roll back its commitments this year due to the US sanctions against its oil and banking spheres.",
    "articleText": "Head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation Ali Akbar Salehi has announced that the country will start enriching uranium up to 5% at the Fordow nuclear site on 6 November. The official added that the process of injecting gas into the centrifuges, enriching uranium, will be monitored by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Salehi further noted that if necessary, Iran is capable of enriching uranium up to 20% at the Fordow plant. The official added that currently, the country has enough 20% enriched uranium stockpiled. © AP Photo / Vahid salemi In this picture taken April 9, 2009 the exterior view of Iran's Uranium Conversion Facility outside the city of Isfahan, 255 miles (410 kilometers) south of the capital Tehran is photographed. Iran is lagging behind on equipping a bunker with machines enriching uranium to a grade that can be turned quickly to arm nuclear warheads and now says will produce less at the site than originally planned, diplomats tell The Associated Press. The diplomats said that Iranian officials recently told the International Atomic Energy Agency that half of the approximately 1,000 centrifuges to be installed at the underground Fordow site will churn out uranium enriched to near 20 percent, while the rest will produce low-enriched material at around 3.5 percent. Previously, the country's President Hassan Rouhani issued an order for the Fordow nuclear site to start enriching uranium up to 5% starting 6 November as the next step in Iran's policy of scaling back its commitments under the nuclear deal. Uranium enriched to levels between 3% and 5% is widely used in nuclear reactors around the world. When uranium is enriched beyond 20%, it is considered to be highly enriched and potentially useable in the creation of nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly stated that it is developing its nuclear programme only for peaceful purposes, citing religious constraints prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons. But some countries, like Israel, continue to accuse Tehran of trying to build its own nukes. Iran Nuclear Deal In order to address the suspicions surrounding Iran's nuclear programme, a group of countries called the P5+1 reached an agreement in 2015 called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal. According to the agreement, Iran's ability to develop its nuclear programme was severely limited – namely, it could not enrich uranium above 3.67%. In return, all international sanctions were lifted from the country. The deal suffered a heavy blow after the US decided to pull out of it in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on Iran’s banks and oil industry, threatening to punish any entities dealing with the country in these spheres. The remaining signatories to the JCPOA condemned the move and vowed to find a way to work around the American sanctions in order to continue doing business with Iran. © AP Photo / Hamid Foroutan Heavy water nuclear facility near Arak, Iran Despite their efforts, many companies cut ties with the Islamic Republic and the country’s oil trade is still suffering due to the sanctions. The EU introduced a special trading mechanism called INSTEX to bypass the US restrictions, but it failed to protect Iran’s oil trade. In light of this situation, Iran announced in May 2019 that it would start to gradually roll back its commitments under the JCPOA unless the remaining signatories come up with a solution to its economic woes. It has since gone through three stages of such roll-backs.",

Nasser Abu Bakr, the head of the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, in turn, said that he intended to send a letter to Twitter with a demand to stop blocking Palestinian websites and activists' accounts. On 2 November, Twitter suspended all of the news agency's accounts, including its Arabic, Breaking News, and English variations. QNN claims that the reason for the suspension is due to Israel's pressure on the social media company.

    "articleText": "\"This [DBS] is very much a collaborative project between WADA [World Anti-Doping Agency], the IOC, the International Testing Agency, as well as several National Anti-Doping Organisations, including the United States, China, Japan, Switzerland and Australia. In a meeting between these partners, it was agreed that the DBS method should be implemented no later than at the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 but that some aspects of DBS testing could be used as early as the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\", Bach said in a statement issued at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in Poland’s Katowice. He described the method as one of the most promising research projects in the anti-doping efforts. \"In this respect, one of most the promising collective research projects is the Dried Blood Spot method. This DBS method could very well revolutionise the anti-doping fight, since it will allow for the fast, simple and cost-effective collection of samples that can be easily and cheaply transported and stored\", Bach noted. Commenting on the possible participation of Russian athletes in the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the IOC president told Sputnik that the final decision on the issue would be made by WADA. In September, WADA launched a new non-compliance procedure against Russia and gave the Russian Anti-Doping Agency three weeks to explain \"inconsistencies\" that the anti-doping watchdog found in probes received from the Moscow anti-doping laboratories earlier this year. After receiving the data from Moscow, WADA's investigation and intelligence department suspected that the records had been manipulated before being submitted. Russia sent its response to WADA on 8 October, with the latter having vowed to analyse the information by the end of November.",

    "title": "This is America, You Can Do Whatever You Want: UFC Chief on Trump ‘Booing Incident’ at Recent Fight",
    "description": "Trump’s appearance at UFC 224, which took place at Madison Square Garden on 2 November, apparently stole the show, as after the main fight between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, everyone seemed to be talking about only one thing – whether Trump had been booed or cheered by the audience.",
    "articleText": "UFC boss Dana White commented on President Donald Trump’s attendance at UFC 224, saying that the audience had treated Trump with respect. During the post-fight press conference, White responded to allegations that the president had been booed when he appeared in the arena, remarking that people in the United States are free to express themselves. \"Whoever you are, this is America. You can believe or do whatever you want. If you want to boo, you can boo. As an American, you can do whatever you want to do, and you can choose whatever side you want to be on”, Dana White said. Multiple videos posted online show the spectators going crazy when the 45th president appears in the arena, with netizens and the public arguing whether Trump was being booed or cheered. That sound you hear is @realDonaldTrump getting booed at #UFC244 pic.twitter.com/oklkQzGMpk — Mitch Horowitz (@MitchHorowitz) November 3, 2019 While commenting on the incident, UFC head Dana White complained about the current political situation in the United States. “There is this craziness going on politically right now… if you are a Trump guy you don’t like certain types of people. There’s a lot of bulls*** in that. The country is in a crazy place right now with all that\", he said. White also praised Trump’s decision to attend the event and his support for the UFC, saying the president’s appearance at the fight was a landmark moment both for the UFC as an organisation and for MMA as a sport. \"I have walked out of that tunnel for the last 20 years, I’ve never f***ing seen anything like that in my life like tonight when I walked out of that tunnel with him. I will never forget it as long as I live. It was crazy. Everything that ever happened to me in my career, Trump was the first guy to pick up the phone and reach out to me. When we first bought this company venues didn’t want us, no venue wanted the UFC. At the time Trump reached out and asked us to come to the Taj Mahal and that’s where we ended up doing our first two events, cut us great deals, showed up at the first fight and stayed till the end”, Dana White said. Was the president booed or cheered? The US mainstream media quickly jumped to the conclusion that most of the audience attending the event had mercilessly booed the president, while other outlets noted that the reaction was mixed and that Trump and his entourage was cheered. The president himself took to Twitter and said that suggestions he was jeered were fake news. Netizens were divided on the issue, with some pointing out that most of the videos show that the audience was unhappy to see the commander-in-chief. No, I watched several videos from different people. You were booed, far more than you were cheered! — Jodie Moss (@jodiemoss1976) November 3, 2019 Correct. It’s fake news. Most were booing. — MelWill (@SamSidneyTe) November 3, 2019 Other social media users sided with the president, saying that his appearance caused euphoria and that Democrats still can’t forgive the 73-year-old Republican for their loss in the 2016 presidential election. It's true, the crowd was smiling, men and women were cheering, it was a feeling of ecstasy and euphoria when President Trump entered! — Michael Samuels (@MSamuels_LINY) November 3, 2019 Disrespect of this man is all from sore losers. — Michael Collins (@mcollinsbals) November 3, 2019",

    "description": "The fate of the young pharaoh, dubbed the baby king, who inherited the throne of Ancient Egypt at nine years of age and died ten years later, has mesmerised historians for almost a century, ever since his tomb and mummy were discovered in the 1920s. In 2020, this enigma might be solved.",
    "articleText": "Scientists and history enthusiasts have been perplexed by the mystery of Tutankhamun’s death for decades, but is there any hope that it is finally about be explained? Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass has set high expectations, noting that DNA technology will assist in this, Express.co.uk reports. According to him, DNA tests and CT scans have already shown that the Egyptian pharaoh was not murdered, as some have believed since 1968, when X-rays found bone fragments in his skull. The new tests are said to have pointed to another injury that the 19-year-old “baby king” suffered right before his death. Accident or Not? Hawass told the British tabloid that Tutankhamun had a fracture in his left leg, which shows the renowned Egyptian ruler experienced an accident two days before meeting his end. A new machine, which the archaeologist referred to as the Egyptian Mummy Project, is expected to give researchers more information about the young king – for example, if he had any genetic diseases. “It will also tell us if he had an infection. If he had an infection, this means he died in an accident. Next year will be the year we announce exactly how he died”, Hawass said. Search for Truth Doesn’t Cease to Surprise Egypt’s Minister of Antiquities Khaled El-Enany has revealed to the outlet that the effort to shed light on the pharaoh’s death continues. According to him, researchers have not had a conclusive opinion until now. “Each year we have a conference on Tutankhamun and each year we have something new. Dr Hawass and his team are now doing work from the CT scan of the mummy and that is still continuing”, the official said. 100-Year-Long Hunt for Truth Pharaoh Tutankhamun’s tomb, located in Egypt’s mysterious Valley of the Kings on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Luxor, was excavated in 1922 by Howard Carter, on behalf of Lord Carnarvon. The tomb was a veritable treasure trove that scientists and archaeologists laboured on for over eight years, as they removed the artefacts, wary of the fragile state of the tomb, with Carter ensuring that the findings were meticulously recorded. Since then, some of the artefacts remain shrouded in mystery, as little is known about them even today.",

    "description": "It appears that sex-related offences are quite a common reason for music or cinema A-listers to quit their fields despite lucrative years of work and enormous public recognition.",
    "articleText": "In the latest case, Rabi Pirzada, a Pakistani pop singer and TV host, announced that she is done with the show business after her nude pictures and videos were leaked online on Friday. Despite the images and video being subsequently taken down, she remained one of the top-trending personas in Pakistan for over 24 hours as a result of the lewd leak. She is by far not the only star to have given her farewell to the music entertainment industry in wake of sex-related allegations and sex crime convictions. Here is a top-6 of the most widely debated ones. Harvey Weinstein Arguably the most notorious case is the one involving Miramax co-founder and Hollywood director Harvey Weinstein: once one of entertainment’s most powerful men, he’s been depleted by bombshell accusations from over 80 women of sexual abuse, ranging from harassment to rape, which are set to result in a criminal trial beginning on 6 January 2020. However, according to sources in Weinstein’s inner circle, cited by CNN, he is still combative, maintains he is innocent, and is planning a career comeback after the trial is over. Ian Watkins Lostprophets’ frontman Ian Watkins is yet another artist to feature in a high-profile sex abuse case that cost him his career. Back in 2013, Watkins was sentenced to 35 years for a series of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby, after pleading guilty to 13 child sex offences. Gary Glitter English glam rock singer Gary Glitter, extremely popular in the genre's era of the 1970s, was first convicted for downloading thousands of items of child pornography. The charges were intermingled with acquittals, until he was eventually indicted in 2014 over historical child sex offences. In February 2015, he was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assaults, including sex with a girl under 13, which saw him sentenced to an overall 16 years behind bars. BigBang's Seungri Former South Korean celebrity, DJ, and member of the mega-popular K-pop boy band BigBang Seungri (Lee Seung-hyun) retired in 2019 amid allegations of him supplying prostitutes in 2015, which was also part of the Burning Sun scandal – the most massive to hit the K-pop industry in recent memory, prompting President Moon Jae-in to kick-start a thorough investigation.

He was alleged to have secretly filmed his own sex videos and then shared them with friends. Separately, he has faced accusations of group rape of an unconscious woman - something that the rock star has denied. F.T. Island’s Choi Jong-hoon The tremendously popular Korean band’s leader and guitarist likewise retired from showbiz as a result of allegations of being involved in bribery and sharing of lewd sex videos and pictures in the same chatroom as Jung Joon-young.

    "articleText": "The donation was approved in March but was not disclosed in July when the academic year’s donations were made public, according to the Guardian newspaper. The daily quoted the British university as saying that the cash injection was \"the final gift\" in a commitment made in 2014 before it had agreed to set out plans for divesting from energy companies. The university reportedly argued that the Shell-funded research would look into ways of \"making chemical processes for industrial use more sustainable\" to back its zero carbon emissions goal. However, the paper found that hydrocarbon recovery would remain among the researched areas. The university page of research leader Lynn Gladden lists magnetic resonance as a method used in oil recovery to assess the fluid composition within oil-bearing rocks.",

    "description": "Russia already denounced the recently revealed US strategy to \"secure\" Syrian oil facilities under the pretext of defending them from falling into the hands of remaining Daesh* fighters. Moscow believes that Washington will assist in efforts to smuggle this oil out of the country.",
    "articleText": "The US has started building new bases in the Deir Ez-Zor governorate, specifically near the town of al-Sur, the Turkish Anadolu Agency reported citing local sources. The exact purpose of this base remains unclear, but the province, where the US reportedly had deployed between 250 and 300 soldiers, numerous construction vehicles, armoured transports and weaponry, is known to be the most oil-rich region of Syria. The news of the construction of the new base was preceded by US President Donald Trump announcing that the American forces, which remain in Syria, are currently tasked with \"keeping the oil\". \"We want to bring our soldiers home. But we did leave soldiers because we’re keeping the oil. I like oil. We’re keeping the oil\", Trump said. Partial Withdrawal Amid Turkish Offensive Washington has announced the withdrawal of its troops in October just days prior to the start of the Turkish military operation against the US allies the Kurdish forces in Syria's north and north-east. However, days after these troops crossed into Iraq, some of them returned, reportedly settling in the Deir Ez-Zor governorate. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper elaborated on their return, saying that some American troops will stay in Syria, after all, to \"defend\" oil facilities from being re-captured by Daesh* stragglers. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the US bid to control Syrian oil as going against international law, citing the illegal nature of American troop presence in the country, thus making it \"unacceptable\". Previously, the Russian Defence Ministry accused the US of assisting in smuggling Syrian oil out of the country and presented satellite images that substantiated the accusations. © AFP 2019 / Delil Souleiman Members of the special forces of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are pictured during preparations to join the front against Turkish forces, on October 10, 2019 The Deir Ez-Zor governorate is partially controlled by Damascus' forces, while other parts remain under the control of Kurdish fighters backed by the US. The recent US withdrawal from Syria's north left Kurds alone in their fight against Turkey, which targeted their militia, primarily the SDF's People's Protection Units (YPG), a terrorist group. In this light, the SDF started seeking negotiations with Damascus on options for integrating with the Syrian military forces. Ankara started its most recent military operation, called \"Peace Spring\", on 9 October in a bid to clear northern Syrian territory bordering Turkey of terrorist groups. Turkey believes that the region was controlled not only by groups like Daesh*, but also by affiliates of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), deemed a terrorist organization by Ankara.",

    "description": "UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) - United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths on Tuesday welcomed the signing of a power-sharing agreement between the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council, saying the accord marks a vital step toward achieving peace in the country.",
    "articleText": "“I congratulate the Government of Yemen and the Southern Transitional Council on reaching an agreement on the way forward,” Griffiths said. “The signing of this agreement is an important step for our collective efforts to advance a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Yemen.” The agreement stipulates the return of the Hadi government to the capital Aden, which was seized by the STC forces in August; unifying the two sides’ militaries under a central command; and establishing a government with equal power-sharing. Griffiths emphasised the importance of listening to the needs and suggestions of stakeholders in the south of the country and expressed hope the agreement will promote stability in and around Aden and improve the lives of the Yemeni people. Earlier on Tuesday, the Yemeni government and the STC signed in Riyadh an agreement under the auspices of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, STC President Aidarus Zoubaidi attended the signing of the agreement. Last summer, the STC seized Aden and other areas in the south of Yemen reportedly with the backing of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Hadi harshly criticized the UAE and demanded its forces be excluded from the Saudi-led Arab coalition operating in Yemen. Yemen has been engulfed in an armed conflict between the government forces, led by President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi, and the rebel Houthi movement for several years now. The Saudi-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthis at Hadi's request since March 2015. The conflict has resulted in a massive humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country. The conflict has been described by the United Nations as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with an estimated 24 million people - nearly 80 per cent of the Yemeni population - currently in need of aid and protection.",

The statement comes after Ankara and Washington reached on 17 October an agreement on a 120-hour ceasefire to allow the withdrawal of YPG forces from the Turkish border area days after the start of the Turkish military operation against Kurdish militants in northern Syria. As the five-day truce came to an end, Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a memorandum that would see the Kurdish fighters pull back from the border area. In addition, Turkey and Russia have since begun joint patrols in the operation zone in Syria along the Turkish border. On 9 October, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring in northeastern Syria to clear the area of Kurdish units and the Daesh* terrorist group.

    "description": "With preparations for December’s snap general election unfolding in the UK, representatives of the country’s two leading parties have engaged in a heated Twitter debate following an anti-Semitic comment by a user who claimed to be a member of the Labour Party.",
    "articleText": "A Conservative British minister, Michael Gove, wound up in hot water this week after he shared an anti-Semitic tweet from an alleged member of the Labour Party-backed Momentum group and urged Jeremy Corbyn along with his top supporters to condemn the post. However, as was later revealed, the person did not belong to either of the organisations, prompting representatives of the Labour Party and Momentum group to call on Gove to publicly apologise for the blunder. This is from a Corbyn supporter and Momentum member - I hope I can see condemnation of this grotesque anti-semitism from @jeremycorbyn , @ParkerCiccone , @AyoCaesar and @mattzarb https://t.co/xcYdvwpGl9 — Michael Gove (@michaelgove) November 3, 2019 The row began when a man called Joe Wood, in a now hidden tweet, replied to Holocaust Education Trust Chief Executive Karen Pollock's post with a comment that read “we can’t trust Jews”. The tweet was screenshotted by Pollock and later shared by Gove, who condemned the alleged Labour supporter’s remark. I posted this during the #Marr show https://t.co/xacewXLXpI As well as receiving a tirade of responses about ‘smears’, the most telling was the post below. Acc to a Labour activist with the usual hashtag, “we can’t trust Jews” pic.twitter.com/Vft9NCfJhv — Karen Pollock (@KarenPollock100) November 3, 2019 However, both Labour and Momentum later insisted that Joe Woods, who claimed to belong to both on his Twitter account, was not a member of either of the two, slamming Gove for failing to check facts and trying to “smear” Labour politicians by association. Joe Woods is not a Momentum member, but obviously you didn't bother to check with us first. This is a deliberate attempt to smear by association. Disgraceful behaviour from a Cabinet Minister. — Momentum (@PeoplesMomentum) November 3, 2019 Momentum’s National Coordinator and former Corbyn aide Laura Parker condemned the user’s “abhorrent” comment, but also criticised Gove for playing up controversy, as quoted by The Independent. “We condemn the clearly antisemitic content of the tweet falsely attributed to a Momentum member”, Momentum’s representative said. “Ordinarily I would be shocked by such behaviour, but there seems to be no limit to how low this government is willing to go. Gove should retract his comments and apologise”. The controversy comes amid preparations for the UK snap general election, currently set for 12 December, where both the Conservatives and Labour will face each other in a heated competition – the results of which many observers believe will be the most unpredictable in modern British history. Michael Gove, who is responsible for leading the Boris Johnson government’s preparations for Brexit, has not publicly commented on the incident.",

    "description": "In late October, Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo said in an interview with Reuters that the crackdowns as part of the anti-drug campaign had mainly targeted the poor, as police had been allowed to abuse abuse their power.",
    "articleText": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appointed Leni Robredo, the country's vice president and his main political rival, to oversee the ongoing anti-drug campaign. The move came after Robredo criticised the campaign, citing the alarming death toll of what has become Duterte's signature policy. According to a presidential spokesman, the decision was prompted by the desire to implement a new approach to the anti-drug effort, although Robredo's spokesman said that the move was aimed at making the vice president a scapegoat for the shortcomings of the campaign. \"If she has been criticising the drug war as ineffective, then there must be ideas on her mind to make it effective\", presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said. Duterte campaigned on the promise to end drug-related crime in the country. As a follow-up to his election as president in June 2016, he launched a large-scale anti-drug campaign that has led to the death of thousands of people in police anti-drug raids. The president has been accused of violating human rights by campaigners and international organisations, who claim that the real death toll of Duterte's drug war vastly exceeds the numbers provided by official statistics. Philippine officials have stressed that the victims were suspected drug dealers who resisted arrest. Last year, Duterte revoked his country's membership of the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it launched a preliminary investigation into alleged crimes against humanity.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): According to New Zealand’s refreshed visa policies, couples hoping to migrate to the country must have lived together for at least 12 months, making it hard for Indians in new arranged marriages to bring their spouses back to New Zealand.",
    "articleText": "After New Zealand-based Indian couples expressed concerns on the country’s latest visa rules modifications, parliamentarian Shane Jones labelled the Indian community's concerns a “Bollywood over-reaction” leading to a tensed situation in the Wellington. Infuriated by Jones' \"racist\" remarks on the \"insensitive\" visa rule that has made it difficult for people in arranged marriages to bring their spouses to New Zealand, Indians as well as New Zealand natives have taken to social media to slam the MP.

    "title": "Is Trump's Absence From ASEAN Summit a Sign of Rising US Disinterest in the Region?",
    "description": "US President Donald Trump decided not to attend the ASEAN*-US Summit and the East Asia Summit in Bangkok on Monday and sent White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien as his special envoy.",
    "articleText": "In response to US actions, seven out of the ten ASEAN member states also downgraded their representation, sending their foreign ministers instead. A US diplomat has voiced Washington's \"extreme\" concern over the move by the majority of ASEAN's leaders not to personally attend the special event, calling it an “intentional effort to embarrass” Trump. “We are extremely concerned by the apparent decision\", the diplomat was quoted by Kyodo News as saying. So could Trump’s absence from the Bangkok summits be a sign of rising US disinterest in the region? Many experts believe this is the case. “Trump sending someone less than the alternate Head of State (the vice president) to a meeting with ASEAN heads of state in an important annual event tends to reinforce their perceptions that Southeast Asia is not really a priority for the US\", says Dr Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea. While Dr Batongbacal noted that the US president might be too preoccupied with an ongoing impeachment inquiry against him, he didn’t have a valid excuse not to attend or at least send an appropriate representative. Dr Le Hong Hiep, a fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, for his part, explained that despite Trump missing this year's gathering the US President has invited ASEAN leaders to a special summit in the United States in early 2020. But, nevertheless, he believes that Trump’s absence should not be exaggerated and should be put into context. “From what I see, the US remains engaged with the region and Trump’s absence from the summit does not mean Washington has changed its policy direction\", Dr Le Hong Hiep added. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines only sent only their foreign ministers to the ASEAN-US Summit, and only the leaders of Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos attended the meeting. “I don’t think ASEAN leaders intended to “embarrass” Trump. Rather, it could be their efforts to pressure the US to maintain its engagement with the region\", director of the Centre for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, Dr Zhang Baohui said. The countries in the region want the US to maintain its presence, especially amid China’s increasing role, according to Dr Baohui. But Trump’s decision to skip the summit for the second year straight has raised concerns among East Asian nations with many fearing rising US disinterest in the region. “My guess is that they thus use the boycott to show disappointment with the Trump administration’s policy in the region\", the scholar added. Trump’s special envoy Robert O'Brien delivered a message from the president at the summit reaffirming the United States’ commitment to a strategic partnership with ASEAN and its support of the organisation's central role in the Indo-Pacific region. But, John Short, a political analyst and professor of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, says that Trump has shown little interest in the region, and the fact that the Trump administration didn't even send a member of the cabinet to the EAS and US-ASEAN summit only proves it. “ASEAN looks to a US presence in the region to counter China's growing influence and especially Chinese claims in the South China Seas that impinge on the maritime claims of at least 5 ASEAN countries\", Mr Short said. But despite the latest snub by the US president, it is important for both US and ASEAN states to maintain a strong relationship as they have a “shared long-term objective of providing a counterweight to Chinese power in the region\", the political analyst concluded. *ASEAN - Association of Southeast Asian Nations The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "Back in 2013, the whistleblower revealed that the US National Security Agency and its foreign counterparts were making extensive efforts to exercise Internet surveillance worldwide. Snowden is currently living in Russia due to Washington wanting to arrest and prosecute him for leaking classified documents to the media.",
    "articleText": "Speaking at the Web Summit, which took place in Lisbon on 4 November, Edward Snowden has warned of the new dangers that technology poses to our world in the hands of some big tech companies cooperating with governments. How exactly are they dangerous? Snowden believes that a union between big tech and governments would essentially be an \"irresistible power\". He added that there is no way to police such \"power\" and make sure that it's not being used against the public. \"When we see government and corporations working in concert... they become the left and right hands of the same body. What we see is the concentration of power\", the whistleblower said. Snowden further pointed out that the focus today needs to be shifted from fighting for data protection to fighting against \"data collection\". The whistleblower argued that users must abandon their \"blind faith […] in the Internet's masters\", apparently referring to cases where user data that was collected by big technological companies became available to third parties. The data of millions of Facebook users was collected by Cambridge Analytica data consultancy and was allegedly used to sway votes in the 2016 US presidential election. After the data collection became public, both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook were subjected to scrutiny by US authorities, sparking a global scandal over the company's handling of user data. US Government Pursuit for Access to Encrypted Messages Snowden's remarks came hot on the heels of US Attorney General William Barr issuing a call for the tech industry to provide police with the tools needed to access encrypted messages, arguing that it could help prevent serious crime. Barr also urged these companies to abandon \"the indefensible posture\" that they lack technical capabilities to provide such access. CC0 Facebook May Now Know When Users Last Had Sex, Spawning Fresh Data Privacy Row \"We would be happy if the companies providing the encryption keep the keys […] Making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world.

    "description": "Scientists from the National University of Science and Technology MISiS have created new aluminium alloys that are cheap and effective to use in a wide variety of modern vehicles. These studies are published in Materials Science and Engineering A magazine.",
    "articleText": "Aluminium and its alloys rank second after iron alloys in terms of scalability. Aluminium is easily processed by forging, stamping and rolling; it is also characterised by low density, and aluminium products are lightweight. Aluminium alloys have high corrosion resistance, high thermal and electrical conductivity (they transmit heat and electric current with minimal losses), strength and ductility, as well as good processibility. They are widely used in the aircraft industry. For example, in many passenger aircraft, aluminium products account for more than 20% of the mass of all structures. Aluminium alloys replace steel in car parts, which reduces their weight and, as a result, saves fuel. The technology for manufacturing thin-walled parts of complex profiles, traditional to engineering, is based on sheet stamping methods. A low metal utilisation rate characterises it, a large number of component units and fasteners (complex parts obtained by stamping, which consist of elements that need to be riveted or welded together). Sheet superplastic forming (SPF), which helps obtain lightweight, solid structures of complex geometry, eliminates these shortcomings. NUST MISiS researchers have made it their mission to develop aluminium alloys with increased strength at room temperature, capable of superplastic forming at elevated speeds. “We melted the necessary components in a furnace at a temperature of about 800° C and put them in a special mould. Then we temper the ingots and roll them into sheets. At each stage, it is important to control their microstructure, the parameters of which determine the structure of the final sheet after intermediate operations. For this, we use 20 thousand-power microscopes. Then we analyze the properties of alloy samples, their strength and ductility at room temperature as well as at elevated temperatures (400-500°C) by stretching the sample until it ruptures,” Anastasia Mikhailovskaya, the lead researcher, associate professor at NUST MISiS, told Sputnik. According to her, the implementation of the superplasticity effect in pressure metal treatment allows obtaining parts of complex shape, very close to the final one, during one operation with relatively low-power equipment. Therefore, this helps to reduce the complexity and cost of manufacturing the product significantly. In addition, the method avoids manual punching, bringing the product to a given geometry. Today, there are several superplastic alloys for SPFs, most of which have meagre strain rates and an elongation of about 300%, Anna Kishchik, a post-graduate student at NISU MISiS, said. “It takes several hours to mould one piece of medium complexity at such a speed; the cost of the technological process is 70-80% of the cost of the final product. Therefore, reducing the moulding time by several times will increase production volumes and reduce the cost of the product. We offer new alloys capable of high-speed SPF – this reduces the time it takes to get one part to 15-20 min, and the possible degrees of deformation exceeds 400%. These are the properties of our alloy, which is 20-30% more durable than its analogues,” she told Sputnik. Before introducing the alloy into production, scientists plan to test it in the conditions of sheet production. Researchers will receive an international patent shortly.",

As reports later revealed, the 40-year-old adult film actress, whose real name was Jessica Redding, was dealing with numerous health issues and alcohol problems.",
    "articleText": "Porn star Jessica Jaymes suffered from a seizure and died of a natural cause, RadarOnline.com reports, citing Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office records. According to the outlet, the 40-year-old adult film actress, born Jessica Redding, had alcohol problems, as the document reportedly points to her “chronic ethanol abuse” over many years. Jessica Jaymes, who shot to fame in 2004 after signing a contract with Hustler and making her debut in the movie \"The Porn Identity\", died in September. A friend allegedly found her unconscious at her home in San Fernando Valley and contacted emergency services, who received a call for a cardiac arrest. However, upon arrival they discovered that Jaymes was already dead. Several media outlets claimed that prescription pill bottles were lying around the death scene. Her business partner told the website AVN that the woman’s death did not come as a surprise due to her health problems. “I was like, ‘When is going to be her time?’ Because I knew it was coming. She was so unhealthy, so many problems, health issues with her back, her nerve system, the seizures in the past six months. I was just waiting. It was a question of time. She was so young”, he said. Jaymes, whose breakthrough came 15 years ago, starred in over 200 adult films and appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\", VH1's \"Celebrity Rehab Sober House\", and HBO's \"Vivid Valley\". The actress has almost one million Instagram followers and appeared as herself in several episodes of the Showtime series \"Weeds\".",

    "description": "The entrepreneur kick-started the Silicon Valley ceremony that attracted both top music stars and tech A-listers to a venue outside the Los Angeles bubble. Each honoree working in science received the biggest award in the field amounting to $3 million, with the total award pool reaching an eye-watering $20 million.",
    "articleText": "Mark Zuckerberg, who has recently been mired in a swirling controversy over his brainchild’s policies to retain political adverts on the platform, entered the limelight yet again as he led the 2020 Breakthrough Prize ceremony in Silicon Valley on Sunday night. Commonly referred to as “the Oscars of Science\", the event, held at NASA Ames Research Centre in Mountain View, California, awarded over $20 million to recognise breakthrough achievements in science and mathematics this year, and is sponsored by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, along with Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Chinese tech giant Ma Huateng, and a number of other entrepreneurs. It was Zuckerberg who kicked off the ceremony alongside Milner, who told the audience that the show aired live on National Geographic and YouTube is “about honouring this important work and the power science has to reveal hidden worlds”, adding that “we all know that the future depends on science\". “As a culture, our progress and prosperity depend on attaching a high value to science and on passing that value onto the next generation,\" the famed entrepreneur and engineer rounded off. The star-studded event, which is in its 8th year, also saw Drew Barrymore, Allison Janney, and Edward Norton take part, coupled with a performance by Lenny Kravitz. The latter had his say in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet before the award show: \"I think it’s also very important to inspire young people who want to get into the sciences. There’s so much pushing kids to go in so many other directions, whether it be sports or be Hollywood — in music, acting — but we need as much help as we can. We live in a world where we need great solutions for great problems\", Kravitz shared inspiringly. However, the night’s biggest gems were the honorees themselves, which included the Event Horizon Telescope Team, who took the first-ever photo of a black hole, winning the Breakthrough Prize in fundamental physics. Jeffrey M. Friedman, F. Ulrich Hartl and Arthur L. Horwich, David Julius and Virginia Man-Yee Lee famously won a Breakthrough Prize in life sciences, while Alex Eskin grabbed a Breakthrough Prize in mathematics. Each recipient was granted a $3 million award – the biggest individual monetary prize in science. Along with the ongoing controversy over user privacy, on the heels of the massive Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have triggered debate, including a congressional hearing, over its political ad policies. On 3 October, Facebook’s approach and rules on “misinformation\" on its platform were quietly revised: previously, all “ads, landing pages, and business practices” were prohibited from sharing “deceptive, false, or misleading content” or making “deceptive claims, offers, or methods”. Now, Facebook only blocks ads that include “claims debunked by third-party fact checkers or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organisations with particular expertise”. \"In most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves”, Zuckerberg noted in front of a committee. On hearing the words, Aaron Sorkin, “The Social Network” scriptwriter, took a veiled swipe at the Facebook founder, saying that had he known about the businessman's attitude towards fact-checking, he would have “had the Winklevoss twins invent Facebook” in his film.",

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Russia has not received any indication from the United States that it is ready to discuss the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.",
    "articleText": "\"There are no advancements on START, no signals from the Americans, no signals about being ready to begin discussing an extension of old modalities or new modalities. It is a long process, and, of course, we will inevitably enter a zeitnot [race against the clock]. If the silence continues, we will enter a period where it will be impossible to agree on some new realities of the arms control\", he told reporters. Peskov stressed the complexity of such talks and refrained from providing a precise time frame for negotiations. The statement comes after Beijing stated that it saw no reason to engage in trilateral disarmament negotiations with the United States and Russia, especially since conditions for such an arrangement do not exist. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent in September a proposal to leaders of several countries, including NATO members, to introduce a moratorium on the deployment of INF Treaty-covered missiles in Europe and other regions. Later, NATO confirmed that it had received the letter, but did not consider this proposal credible. On 2 August, the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned all short-medium (310–620 miles) and intermediate (620–3,420 miles) range ground-launched missiles, citing Russia's alleged violations of the pact as its reason for exiting. In early 2019, US President Donald Trump floated the idea of drafting a new arms control agreement between Washington, Moscow and Beijing. The New START agreement was signed in 2010 by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his US counterpart at the time, Barack Obama. It is currently the only arms control agreement between two countries that is still in force. It is set to expire in February 2021, and so far Washington has shown no inclination to extend it.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Farmers in India have been holding countrywide protests to convince the government to refrain from signing the world’s largest trade deal, which had the potential of opening up the Indian agriculture market to all15 of the member countries.",
    "articleText": "While farmers in India congratulated agriculturists for \"forcing\" the government out of the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), trade bodies said the possibility of the industry and service sectors being \"compromised\" due to this trade pact ended with the government's decision. The RCEP trade agreement comprises the 10-nation Association of the Southeast Asian Nation bloc (ASEAN) and China, Japan, Australia, South Korea, and New Zealand. The pact implies the reduction or abolition of import tariffs to promote free trade among the signatories of the deal. While congratulating agriculturists, India's prominent farmers' trade union said it hopes the country would not try any \"back-door methods\" that would harm the interests of farmers, adding that agriculture should not be brought under the ambit of any free trade deal. Farmers in India were opposed to the entry of world players into the Indian market, as unions claimed they were ill-equipped to deal with world farmers who receive massive production subsidies in their respective countries. The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party farmer's trade union or 'Kisan Morcha, ' Naresh Sirohi, has thanked the government for safeguarding farmers' interests and termed it a \"positive development\". Stating that India is an importer country when it comes to agriculture, he said, the agreement would have allowed the export of agricultural products incurring huge loses for the agricultural-based country. \"Highly-subsidised products from countries such as China and New Zealand would have delivered a blow to the sector which is already in loss,\" Sirohi said. Agriculture is not a \"business\" for the country as it employs the majority of the workforce in India, and it's a question of their livelihood, he added. On the other side, traders and manufacturers dreaded that China, the main force behind the pact, would turn India into a dumping ground for its cheap products, triggering high competition. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) on Tuesday complimented Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, saying several issues remained unresolved in the proposed deal. \"We, at FICCI, fully support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision against joining the RCEP, as several of India's concerns remain unaddressed in the proposed deal. Serious apprehensions and reservations regarding the RCEP have been expressed by many sectors including steel, plastics and copper,\" FICCI President Sandip Somany said in a statement. \"I compliment Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking a very pragmatic decision towards safeguarding the interests of Indian industry and the country as a whole,\" he added. Announcing the decision to stay out of the RCEP, the Indian prime minister on Monday said the deal is \"against his conscience\". \"Our farmers, traders, and industries have stakes in such decisions. Equally important are the workers and consumers, who make India a huge market and the third biggest economy in terms of purchasing power parity… \"…When I measure the RCEP Agreement with respect to the interests of all Indians, I do not get a positive answer. Therefore, my own conscience does not permit me to join RCEP,\" Prime Minister Modi said. He added the present form of the RCEP agreement does not fully reflect the underlying spirit and the agreed guiding principles of the RCEP. While the other 15 nations decided to go ahead with the deal, Australian Prime Minister Scot Morrison said doors would remain \"wide open\" for India to join the RCEP, reported Australian Associated Press. The RCEP negotiators hope to sign the deal in 2020 with the new tariff regime kicking in from 2022.",

    "description": "When you have been involved in politics as long as I, you become almost immune from the stench of hypocrisy which attaches itself to political debate and mainstream media coverage of those debates.",
    "articleText": "With mixed emotions, I read the two-page spread and leading opinion piece in yesterday's Scottish Daily Record newspaper concerning the Westminster Scottish Affairs Committee Report which has called for the decriminalisation of illegal drug use and several other progressive measures designed to tackle problem drug use as a health problem, not a criminal problem. On the one hand, I am pleased that the sane, evidence-based and expert research-informed opinions on tackling illegal drug use are at long last being taken seriously. Far too many lives have been blighted and/or lost on the back of a stupid and counterproductive \"war on drugs\" approach which has always been an insane waste of resources and energy. Too many politicians have shamelessly thumped tables during public meetings and debates and demanded tougher police action and longer sentences for illegal drug users and suppliers while snorting white powder regularly in private and consuming copious amounts of the most dangerous drug in society, namely alcohol. © Photo : Pixabay Alcohol Politicians and their newspaper editor friends have long been known for their private cocaine habits and love affair with expensive brandies and other spirits while they lambasted working-class users of cannabis and heroin as low lives who require the full force of the law mobilised against them. Working-class adherents to hash are no-good layabouts while the middle-class offspring are merely curious rebels harmlessly dabbling with mummy and daddy's generous allowances paying for quality pot. The nonsense and hypocrisy at the heart of the \"war on drugs\" policy and philosophy pursued by the likes of the UK and US Governments was and is unsustainable. After serving my six months sentence in Edinburgh's Saughton prison in early 1992 for trying to stop a poll tax warrant sale, I became even more acutely convinced about the futility of existing drugs laws than I already was before being incarcerated. Most of the prisoners were decent working-class guys from similar housing scheme backgrounds to my own. Those convicted of crimes of dishonesty were often trying to provide for a family through shoplifting or bank robberies. Those convicted of violent crimes almost without fail had one thing in common – alcohol. I remember one day sitting with a group of six or seven prisoners in one guy's cell and they were discussing their charge sheets in preparation of appearance at court on other charges. These were decent individuals who I had shared laughs with and played football in the exercise yard with. Yet when I read the charge sheets I was taken aback. They all had convictions for violent assaults and one involved the use of a stolen car to run over a victim several times. \"What on earth were you thinking of?\" I said to the perpetrator of that heinous crime. \"I don't know Tommy, I can hardly remember anything I was absolutely steaming (very drunk), mate\", was the response. All of the other guys then relayed their tales of being so drunk on alcohol that they could hardly recall what they did or why. Throughout my upbringing in the working-class housing scheme of Pollok in the Southside of Glasgow, I became acutely aware of the violence, inducing qualities of alcohol. Whether in house parties or on street corners alcohol was always at the root of fights, stabbings, slashings and sometimes murders. Alcohol also played a part in turning some of the adult parents I knew from likeable individuals into monsters who mistreated their wives and children. I wanted to be a professional footballer as a kid so my dad always advised me to stay away from alcohol and try and stay fit. © AFP 2019 / STR Rehab residents (back L) sleep in their quarters damaged by drug addicts who escaped from a compulsory rehabilitation centre the night before, in the southern Vietnamese province of Dong Nai on October 24, 2016 I never made it into the professional ranks but that sound advice has informed my life and approach to alcohol. It is not a harmless substance but an addictive and personality changing drug which often spawns violence in particular circumstances. Yet not only was alcohol legal it was actually promoted widely and effectively through expensive advertising campaigns which made it appear cool and normal to consume. Cannabis, on the other hand, was demonised and frowned upon by the great and the good in society. Yet in Saughton Prison cannabis was easily accessible with the right contacts and currency. It was consumed by a large section of prisoners. The truth is most prison officers turned a blind eye as the guys having a toke at night in their cells were likely to be relaxed and chilled out. No bother for the night shift. That experience of mine in Saughton Prison for my part in organising the prevention of a poll tax warrant sale almost thirty years ago can be generalised and extrapolated to illustrate the futility of drugs laws. If cannabis can be supplied in the strict closed conditions of a prison how the hell can you hope to prevent it being available in open society? A war on drugs really means a war on ordinary people and communities. Nowadays with the introduction of mandatory blood tests for the prison population, it is heroin and Valium which is more prevalent as cannabis stays in the bloodstream for days compared the quick exit of the other drugs. It was a stupid measure in my opinion. Many occasional cannabis users have entered Scottish prisons without serious addictions but exited with dangerous heroin habits. Use of drugs is rife in prisons to help counter the boredom and pain of isolation from families and loved ones. My position in relation to the futility and counterproductive nature of drug laws has been consistent throughout my adult life. Not so the tabloids like the Daily Record and many politicians. Here's what I had to say in the Scottish Parliament about illegal drugs eighteen years ago on March 22nd 2001 during a debate on a Committee Report that confirmed more and more Scots were addicted to and dying from the use of illegal drugs, mostly heroin. \"We have major problems in our society with problem drug misuse, but they are not all related to heroin. Last year in Scotland, there were 13,000 premature tobacco-related deaths, 1,000 premature alcohol-related deaths and, tragically, 163 premature heroin-related deaths, according to the Registrar General for Scotland… in 1994 there were 52 deaths from heroin and in 1999 there were 163 deaths from heroin. CC0 Drug user That is a 200 per cent increase in premature deaths… We must shift towards a change in our drugs laws. We must break the link between heroin supply and cannabis supply. Let us stop criminalising one in four of the Scottish population for using a drug that is no more harmful than tobacco or alcohol. Let us promote no drugs; let us promote alternative lifestyles. CC0 Cannabis Finally, we should investigate what happens in Switzerland and the Netherlands, where addicts are now supplied with pharmaceutical heroin, in recognition of the fact that methadone is more addictive, more toxic and can be more damaging than pharmaceutical heroin. We must investigate other maintenance programmes\". Here's what the tabloid Daily Record had to say about my contribution eighteen years ago when it had a considerably bigger circulation than it has now. Under the front-page headline \"Working Class Zero\" they wrote on March 23rd 2001: \"Sheridan cut a lonely, isolated figure on the parliament's crossbenches. He even launched a vain bid to have the parliament endorse legalising pot. But the move was thrown out\". The Daily Record editorial that day was markedly different from their editorial line yesterday. Under the strident headline ‘RECORD VIEW You're such a bam-pot, Sheridan’ they said: \"In a bizarre display, which provoked the fury and disgust of his fellow-members, Tommy Sheridan destroyed what little credibility he had left. The difference is that Sheridan spouts about the link between drugs and deprivation, while others are prepared to tackle the hard issues head-on. Scotland is marching with the Record against drugs. Only the shameless Sheridan is out of step\". The reason I was daubed \"shameless\" was because I refused to sign up to that newspaper's hypocritical \"Scotland Against Drugs\" campaign and march in April that year as it was nauseatingly hypocritical. It was giving out free lager tokens to those who purchased the paper while pressurising everyone else to endorse their campaign. © AP Photo/ Esteban Felix Marijuana It wasn't me who was \"shameless\", it was them. They were trying to boost dwindling sales by pretending to care about Scotland’s drug abuse problem while giving away free alcoholic lager tokens at the same time. It was an absolutely pathetic strategy that many more MSPs should have had the courage to expose and resist. Earlier that month that newspaper was angry that I organised an event to promote legalisation of cannabis to coincide with their hypocritical march against drugs. In another front-page tirade on 7th March 2001 under the headline \"THE WIT AND WISDOM OF DOPEY TOMMY\" they wrote: \"Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan lamely tried to defend his attempt to hold a pro-pot march as 'a protest against drug abuse in a different way'… And the dopey MSP even claimed that his protest is just another approach in the fight against the evils of the drugs trade destroying a generation\". Therein sits the hypocrisy of tabloids like the Daily Record and many politicians. They have changed their tunes now on the need to change the drugs laws to tackle the problems of illegal drug use but without an apology to the many people who have been arguing for such an approach for years and facing ridicule and scurrilous headlines as a result. When I was arguing for the drug laws to be changed as part of a multi-faceted strategy of increased rehabilitation and treatment services and the change from a criminal to a public health approach the number of heroin-related deaths was 163. That was eighteen years ago. The number of drug-related deaths in Scotland last year soared to 1,187, according to official statistics. The figure is 27% higher than the previous year, and the highest since records began in 1996. It means there were more drug-related deaths in Scotland last year than the 1,136 alcohol-specific deaths. And the country's drug death rate is now nearly three times that of the UK as a whole and is higher than that reported for any other EU country. Tackling the scourge of problem drug use requires more than one response. Recognition that it is a health problem and not a criminal one is essential but must be tied to increased resources for drug addiction treatment and support as well as wider measures to eradicate poverty and the hopelessness it brings in its wake. © East News / PhotoNonStop RM Head of Advocacy and Policy with the leading children’s rights organisation said that the problem of children being trafficked and then forced into working in the illegal drugs trade is not new to the UK. A golfer would win nothing if he or she carried only one club in their bag. Drivers, putters and several irons are prerequisites for success. So in the approach to problem drug use, we have to deploy several policies and legalisation, not decriminalisation, of cannabis and other drugs is a vital start. All drugs currently illegal should be legalised, regulated, licenced and taxed. Advertising should be prohibited but the state not criminal and violent gangs should be responsible for the sale of drugs. The millions in tax revenues generated should be dedicated to the treatment of drug addiction. The current provision of such services is woefully inadequate. Even the leading candidate in the Democratic Presidential nomination race, Bernie Sanders, endorses this approach with his clear and forthright commitment to legalise marijuana in America. Alcohol is legal but not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic. Tobacco is legal but less and less people are smoking. Cannabis, heroin, cocaine being legally available under strict licenced conditions will not lead to more addicts but it will lead to safer use. Education and investment in healthier living and lifestyles are central to qualitative life improvements but the drugs laws are part of the problem not part of the solution. They have to be changed fundamentally as soon as possible. The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "A number of Huawei’s potential partners in the development of superfast 5G technology have raised concerns over security issues emerging from collaboration with the Chinese tech giant after being pressured by the US, who has accused the firm of spying on behalf of the Chinese authorities. Both the firm and Beijing have denied all the allegations.",
    "articleText": "Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping has urged companies to build partnerships with the Chinese telecom giant to develop 5G technology applications, insisting that its participants will be “the biggest winners”, CNBC reports. “This is a huge market worth trillions of US dollars”, Guo said. “The biggest winners will be our partners”. The comments were made during a Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon on Monday, where Huawei’s top executive discussed the spread of new superfast fifth generation commercial networks that would enable the transmission of a large amount of data and said that the rollout was going “more rapidly than expected”. “We predict by the end of this year we will see 60 commercial 5G networks\", Guo added. © REUTERS / RAFAEL MARCHANTE Huawei's rotating chairman Guo Ping speaks during the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, November 4, 2019 The Chinese tech titan is currently a leading provider of 5G equipment and has reportedly struck over 50 commercial 5G contracts around the world despite being barred from some major industrial markets such as Japan and Australia, following a US assault on the company, and concerns raised by a number of activists over the potential health risks from exposure to electromagnetic rays emerging from 5G infrastructure. In May 2019, the US blacklisted Huawei and around 70 of its subsidiaries from purchasing American technology and doing business with US companies based on charges of industrial espionage and the use of equipment for illegal surveillance purposes on behalf of the Chinese government. Huawei has repeatedly denied any previous or potential spying activities or providing data to Beijing. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has, however, also raised doubts about Berlin's potential collaboration with the Chinese giant, claiming that Huawei was still obliged to pass on information to the Chinese government based on national security laws, as reported by Euronews. Maas insisted that Berlin would try to test the “trustworthiness” of Huawei’s 5G security catalogue in the future. Despite security concerns raised by a number of potential partners and Huawei’s failure to license Android’s latest version of its operating system on the firm's new Mate 30 phone following the US ban, the company has reportedly increased its revenue by 24% and increased global shipments of smartphones by 26% this year.",

    "description": "The event was launched after UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn agreed to a 12 December general elections, leading to a fierce contest for majority control of Parliament amid a three-year impasse over Brexit.",
    "articleText": "Brexit Party Making a \"Massive Impact\" on the UK, Brexit - Richard Tice, Brexit Party Chairman 5m Brexit Supporters in Labour Heartlands the 'Most Vulnerable' - Nigel Farage Farage Opens Up To Media About Brexit, PM Johnson Leading members of the Brexit Party introduced 600 parliamentary candidates (PPCs) on Monday at a rally in Westminster, London on Monday. Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice and party leader Nigel Farage delivered speeches to highlight party gains in recent weeks. Brexit Party Making a \"Massive Impact\" on the UK, Brexit - Richard Tice, Brexit Party Chairman Richard Tice opened the speech by noting how the Brexit Party had been putting pressure on major contenders to trigger a general election. — The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 4, 2019 The Brexit Party had made a “massive impact on the future direction on the UK and its general election\", Mr Tice said, adding that Labour was “petrified as to what may happen in the Labour heartlands”. Former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith had accused the Tories of becoming the Brexit Party, but were “far, far from it”, Tice said. Brexit was “absolutely vital” and resonated among many groups and political viewpoints, he noted, evidencing that the “zombie Parliament” in Westminster was “almost finished”. — The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 4, 2019 The Brexit Party was not a “single-issue party”, but held a policy platform with key issues such as reforming the postal voting system, replacing the House of Lords with a smaller democratic upper chamber and further scrutiny of Supreme Court judges, Mr Tice explained. Massive investment was urgent across the country and the Brexit Party platform would raise £200bn by scrapping High Speed 2 (HS2), recalling £39bn in contributions to the EU, £7bn to the European Investment Bank (EIB) and 50 percent of foreign aid towards UK public services, among others, he said. — Richard Tice (@TiceRichard) November 4, 2019 ‘Left-behind’ regions across the UK would benefit from £100bn in physical infrastructure, roads, railways and digital connectivity, Mr Tice added. Investing in young people with interest-free loans and levy-free apprenticeships were also key policies, he explained, as well as \"common-sense\" strategies such as tackling environmental issues by improving domestic recycling programmes and planting thousands of trees across the UK. 5m Brexit Supporters in Labour Heartlands the 'Most Vulnerable' - Nigel Farage Parliamentary candidates should remain strong whilst standing up for Party principles, despite potential abuse from the media and political opposition, Mr Farage said. He said: \"I’m guessing that you, our prospective parliamentary candidates, over the course of a week or two, have begun to receive a little bit of abuse. Good! I’ve had twenty-five years of it! The 12 December general election had seen the “two big political tribes” regroup, with MPs \"turning their backs” on promises made during and after the June 2016 EU Referendum and 2017 general elections, Farage said. Farage slammed the mainstream media and others for placing too much focus on dialogue between the Tory and Brexit parties, stating that “the media and everyone else has forgotten the fact that 5m Labour voters had voted [for] Brexit”. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 4, 2019 Mr Farage added: “And what we discovered was that [Mrs May] came back with that plan of Chequers, that new EU treaty she wanted the country to sign up to, [knowing] the fact that it was the most abject surrender... a document you would have only signed if you had been beaten in war. “It was utterly shameful and thank goodness, it had been defeated,” Farage said to the sound of applause. Mr Farage said that whilst Boris Johnson was “full of optimism, energy, and fire”, he had only amended Mrs May’s treaty “in terms of the customs union membership” for the UK. But in doing so, Mr Johnson had “hived off” a part of the UK, referring to Northern Ireland, despite promises not to do so, leading to future “disastrous” problems with Scotland and a further three years of negotiations with EU Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier. “Now that is a very tempting slogan on a public, who over three and a half years of this process, have just about had enough,” he said. © Sputnik / Demond Cureton Brexit supporters rally in front of Parliament near a crowd of Remainers in London on 4 November 2019 Nigel Farage restated issues with the Prime Minister’s EU treaty, including raising the EU divorce bill from £39bn to £65bn and forcing the UK to remain in the EU Common Fisheries policy to renegotiate future trade agreements with Brussels, among others. The Brexit Party had attempted build a “patriotic alliance” with Conservatives and “strong voices in the Labour Party” on the basis of free trade and a clean-break Brexit, which would win a parliamentary majority, Mr Farage said. But he slammed Conservatives for shutting down the argument, citing Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said “the Brexit Party should stand aside and leave it to the Conservatives”. The “clock was ticking” with only ten days left before nominations had closed, he said. — Theodora Dickinson (@TheaDickinson) November 4, 2019 “There will be no Brexit without the Brexit Party,” he said whilst stating that it was more important to support the Party’s 600 PPCs as their leader rather than “being hunkered down” to become elected. Farage Opens Up To Media About Brexit, PM Johnson Speaking to the media about Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Farage said that he believed that No 10 “truly doesn’t want Brexit”. “He does not want a genuine Brexit,” Mr Farage said, adding that there were rumours that “Conservatives may not back the manifesto committed in the summer to leaving with a no-deal clean break,” which Theresa May had known about “two years ago”. © Sputnik / Demond Cureton Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage speaks to members of the press following a party rally in Westminster, London on 4 November 2019 Mr Farage said in a statement: “So, it looks to me that Boris is trying to reunite the Tory tribe in relegating a genuine Brexit in terms of its supporters and direction. Refuting Mr Rees-Moggs claim that he should stand aside, Farage hit back, stating that both the Commons leader and Prime Minister had given speeches in recent months, \"about what was wrong with the new EU treaty”. “That’s what you get in Westminster politics,” Farage said. “There will be a clear choice”, Mr Farage told the media. \"If they want to vote for a party that believes in Brexit, they’ll vote for it in December”. He added: “We are furious at what Labour had done and are angry, in some ways, at what Mr Johnson has been saying, that this [Withdrawal Agreement] ‘gets Brexit done’ when all it does is take us into three more years of negotiations. Prime Minister Johnson began pushing for the UK's departure from the EU since taking office in late July after former PM May's resignation in May. Commons blocked his proposal to trigger snap elections three times in recent months, but Jeremy Corbyn agreed in late October after stating that a no-deal scenario had been taken off the table. A new Parliament would ratify the current Brexit bill after the 12 December elections, Mr Johnson said, and would allow the UK to finalise Brexit following the 2016 EU referendum, where Brits voted 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union.",

    "description": "Before the court hearing Kellen Winslow Jr, who at one point was one of the highest paid football players in the NFL, repeatedly claimed he was innocent and that allegations against him were a “money grab”. His attorney has asserted the sexual encounters were consensual.",
    "articleText": "Former NFL player Kellen Wilson Jr has pleaded guilty to rape and sexual battery to avoid a life sentence. The athlete reached a plea agreement before retrial under which he confessed to raping an unconscious woman in 2003 who was 17 at that time and to raping a 54-year-old hitchhiker. In exchange for the plea, the prosecution reduced the rape of the hitchhiker to sexual battery and agreed to sentence him to between 12 and 18 years in prison. The court also agreed to dismiss other charges. If the 36-year-old former football player had been tried and convicted on all of them he would have faced life in jail. In June, Winslow Jr, who is said to have earned more than $40 million over his 10 seasons in NFL, was found guilty of raping a 58-year-old homeless woman, indecent exposure, and two lewd acts in public involving two women. But the jury in the June trial failed to agree on other charges, including the rape of the unconscious woman and hitchhiker. Winslow Jr’s legal team said they would argue during the sentencing, which is scheduled for February, that the multiple brain injuries he sustained during his career had affected their client’s behaviour. The athlete, who played for the Cleveland Browns, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Seattle Seahawks, New England Patriots, and New York Jets was arrested on charges of rape and kidnapping in 2018, but was later released on bail, which was revoked after more accusations were brought against him. Winslow Jr is the son of renowned athlete Kellen Boswell Winslow, who is widely recognised as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. Winslow Sr, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, attended almost all of his son’s court hearings. As Winslow Jr was leaving the courtroom on Monday he extended his arm to his dad, who responded by touching his heart with his fist.",

    "description": "Speaking at a Monday rally that gathered throngs of supporters amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry, Donald Trump addressed a whole number of issues including the successful hunt for al-Baghdadi as well as “crazy” Democrats obsessed with Russia-centred conspiracy theories.",
    "articleText": "1. Al-Baghdadi Hunted Down 2. Shout Out to Republicans 3. Mueller's Testimony - 'a Wonderful Day...for me' 4. New Round of 'Witch Hunt' in Full Swing At a Kentucky rally on Monday, President Trump addressed a number of crucial international issues, including the elimination of notorious Daesh chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi that hasn't left the headlines ever since it happened early last week. Al-Baghdadi Hunted Down The president recounted to the applauding audience how American special forces had just provided \"the world's number-one terrorist a one-way ticket to hell\", in a metaphoric reference to the now deceased Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killed in a suicide attack during a US raid in the Syrian province of Idlib. He then lauded the efforts of the elite special forces dog, which he had previously touted on Twitter by posting a photoshopped image that featured the dog being awarded for its contribution to the mission: \"The dog will be coming very shortly to the White House!\" Trump remarked standing in front of the crowd of attendees wearing \"Read the transcript!\" shirts in a suggestive allusion to Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, underlying Democrats’ impeachment proceedings dubbed by POTUS a fresh round of “witch hunt garbage\". Shout Out to Republicans Separately, POTUS called on what he referred to as “an angry majority” of voters to send a powerful “signal” to Democrats and the world by handing the GOP a big victory not only in Tuesday’s gubernatorial vote there but likewise in the upcoming elections in the states of Virginia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Amid the clearly audible “USA” chants, POTUS went on to boost Gov. Matt Bevin by ascertaining Republicans’ overall accomplishments under his tenure, including energy independence and historic lows in unemployment rates. Mueller's Testimony - 'a Wonderful Day...for me' Democrats and the impeachment proceedings they spearheaded were also a talking point. \"The Democrats are trying to tear our country apart\", Trump said, noting that partisans had pushed the \"Russia hoax\" and the \"Mueller scam. ... And then, Mr Mueller testified\", Trump said, further saying: “That was a wonderful day -- for me\", he concluded referencing testimony from the former special counsel, who published a final report on his inquiry in April and testified in July, concluding that there was no evidence of collusion between US President Donald Trump and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump proceeded by calling the opposition party \"crazy\" and obsessed with Russian conspiracy theories, bringing up a recent spat between Hillary Clinton and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, in which the former secretary of state implied fellow Democrat Gabbard was being \"groomed\" to be a \"Russian asset\". New Round of 'Witch Hunt' in Full Swing In September, House Democrats kickstarted impeachment proceedings against POTUS Trump in the wake of a complaint by a whistleblower, reportedly from the ranks of the CIA. The whistleblower assumed Trump’s conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky could constitute an abuse of power since the tone was claimed to be pressuring, as the president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to join efforts with the US and Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to look into the Bidens and their possible criminal activities in Ukraine. Both Trump and Zelensky, however, insisted the call was absolutely benign, with POTUS offering to read aloud what he argues is an unredacted transcript of the notorious phone call. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist organisation outlawed in Russia.",

    "description": "BEIJING (Sputnik) - Beijing sees no reason to engage in trilateral disarmament negotiations with the United States and Russia, especially since conditions for such an arrangement do not exist, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday.",
    "articleText": "\"Our position is very clear. We believe that there are absolutely no reasons and conditions for conducting trilateral disarmament negotiations with the participation of the United States and Russia. China will not take part in them. We have already said that the United States is constantly trying to involve China in this deal\", Geng said at a briefing. According to him, the United States bears a special responsibility since it possesses the largest and most modern nuclear arsenal. \"The United States should respond to Russia's calls for an extension of the New START [Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty] as well as reduce its huge nuclear arsenal in order to create conditions for other nuclear countries to enter these negotiations\", the spokesman added. Since the termination of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between Washington and Moscow in August, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly mentioned the possibility of concluding a new arms control treaty that includes Russia and China. The New START is the last remaining arms control treaty in force between Russia and the United States. It stipulates that the number of strategic nuclear missiles launchers must be cut by half and limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550. The agreement is set to expire in February 2021 and the US has not so far announced plans to extend it, while Russia has repeatedly stressed that it was ready for a dialogue on the future of the treaty.",

Ola is surcharging!!! #OddEven profiteering — Mankomal Singh (@MKSBsays) November 5, 2019 I read that @Uber_India will deactivate surge pricing during odd even. I still see surge price happening. Is it not valid if we book the cab in Noida? — Rachel (@rachelism__) November 4, 2019 With you on this. There might be no surge pricing but I’ve seen drivers cancel or call and refuse rides. I assume this is coz of Odd even. They aren’t allowed surge so they just find another way. Happened to me yest twice too. How many times to complain? — Shweta Chandan (@shwetachandan) November 5, 2019 Both the private cab aggregators Ola and Uber had earlier clarified they would not resort to ramping up fares during the 12-day scheme. Ride-hailing app Ola announced on 1 November that there will be no peak pricing on rides for the duration the odd-even scheme and will help in ensuring its successful implementation. Arun Srinivas, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer at Ola said, “Ola extends its support to the Delhi Government’s initiative to curb pollution. We will have no peak pricing on rides booked on the Ola platform during the Odd-Even period.\" An Uber spokesperson, meanwhile, said in a statement: “Uber is doing everything possible to ensure easier commuting in the city during odd-even scheme. We have initiated a proactive driver partner campaign in Delhi NCR urging them to offer pledges of support and come out on the roads to ensure maximum rider convenience\". The vehicle rationing scheme in Delhi will remain effective until 15 November. A fine of $56 will be levied on violating adherence to the scheme. Delhi has been grappling with such unprecedented pollution that the Government of India had to intervene in State affairs by calling a high-level meeting to discuss the issue of the deteriorating air quality in the capital city. India's top court intervened and accused the State government of \"passing the buck\" on air pollution and failing to tackle the menace.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): According to a statement made during the third summit of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), India will not join the other 15 states in a China-backed mega trade deal.",
    "articleText": "A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to opt-out of China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Japan has urged India to reconsider its decision and return to the group. “Japan will continue to play a leading role toward an early agreement of the sixteen nations, including India, and for signing of the agreement by the end of 2020,” said Hiroshi Kajiyama, Trade Minister of Japan. China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership envisages a free trade agreement between the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and six other countries. Addressing the RCEP summit in Thailand on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “When I measure the RCEP Agreement with respect to the interests of all Indians, I do not get a positive answer.” A major concern from the Indian side was the welfare and interests of farmers and vulnerable producers such as in the dairy sector, which it thought could be compromised. \"India has significant outstanding issues, which remain unresolved. All RCEP Participating Countries will work together to resolve these outstanding issues in a mutually satisfactory way. India’s final decision will depend on the satisfactory resolution of these issues,\" the RCEP statement said. All the other fifteen countries said in a joint statement that they have agreed the world’s biggest trade pact. New Delhi was pressing for safeguards in the RCEP to prevent a sudden import surge that would negatively impact domestic industries. However, inadequate protections were a key factor that led New Delhi not to sign the pact. “The long-term interest of industry in India is to get well integrated into global value chains and beneficial trade agreements and this could play an important role in realizing this interest,” said Vikram Kirloskar, President of the Confederation of Indian Industry, a major Indian industry association, in a statement. The six nations in addition to ASEAN members in the RCEP talks were India, Australia, China, Korea, Japan and New Zealand.",

    "description": "Over a week after the US announced that the Daesh* leader was killed as a result of an American military operation, AP has reported that Turkish forces have located and detained a relative of the former terrorist number one.",
    "articleText": "Communications Director at the Turkish Presidency Fahrettin Altun has confirmed that the country's forces have captured the sister of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of Daesh* who is now believed to be dead. Turkey's fight against terror regardless of its ideology or origin continues unabated. The arrest of al-Baghdadi's sister is yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations. — Fahrettin Altun (@fahrettinaltun) November 4, 2019 Altun used the announcement to scold those who question Turkey's resolve in fighting Daesh*, calling it \"dark propaganda\". \"We have been leading in the fight against terrorism in all its forms. Our strong counter-terrorism cooperation with like-minded partners can never be questioned\", Fahrettin Altun stated. Previously, the capture of 65-year-old Rasmiya Awad, the older sister of the notorious former Daesh* leader, was reported by the AP, citing an anonymous Turkish official. According to the source, Awad was detained along with her husband, daughter-in-law, and five children in the Syrian town of Azaz, north of Aleppo. © REUTERS / Handout Rasmiya Awad, believed to be the sister of slain Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi The sister and her husband are reportedly being interrogated by Turkish forces, with the source calling Rasmiya Awad an \"intelligence gold mine\". Awad is suspected of being affiliated with the terrorist organisation and thus capable of providing information about its structure and members. \"What she knows about [Daesh*] can significantly expand our understanding of the group and help us catch more bad guys\", the official said, according to AP. Death of the Daesh* Leader On 27 October, US President Donald Trump announced that American forces had raided al-Baghdadi's hideout in Syria's Idlib province and that the terrorist number one killed himself using a suicide vest after being trapped in a dead-end tunnel. His body was mutilated by the blast, but POTUS said he had been identified by his DNA. The remains of the former Daesh* leader were buried at sea and the hideout destroyed in an airstrike. The terrorist organisation confirmed the death of its leader several days later. There have previously been multiple claims that al-Baghdadi had been killed, but each time the reports turned out to be false. © REUTERS / DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Has No DNA Test Data Confirming Al-Baghdadi's Death Syrian Democratic Forces General Mazloum Abdi earlier claimed that the Kurds had a spy in al-Baghdadi's inner circle who revealed the terrorist's location to the SDF. The latter claimed that it had passed the information on to the US, which later allegedly used it to assassinate the Daesh* leader. *Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS) is a terrorist organisation banned in Russia",

    "description": "The identity of the whistleblower who complained about Donald Trump allegedly pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart into launching an investigation into US presidential candidate Joe Biden, which resulted in an impeachment inquiry against the president, remains unknown to the public, but a number of Republicans are calling for him to reveal himself.",
    "articleText": "Donald Trump praised Republican Senator Rand Paul during a campaign rally in Kentucky on Monday after the lawmaker insisted that the media name the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal, with the US president calling the proposal “excellent”. Paul demanded that the media reveal the identity of the anonymous whistleblower who complained about Donald Trump allegedly pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during their 25 July phone call into investigating potential corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, with the complaint resulting in the commencement of an impeachment inquiry against the US president by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. CC BY-SA 2.0 / Gage Skidmore / Rand Paul Paul Rand While the whistleblower remains a subject to federal protection and his attorneys have been negotiating with Congress on holding a possible testimony that would still protect his identity, as reported by The Hill, Paul has insisted that the identity of the individual is known to the media, as he had allegedly worked for former Vice President Joe Biden - something which the senator claims undermines the person’s credibility and impartiality. “We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs”, Paul said during the rally when invited onto the stage by Trump. “I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name”, Paul said to the crowd. Earlier on Monday, Trump himself called upon the whistleblower to testify in front of the public, saying that written answers to the impeachment inquiry proceedings would not be accepted. The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2019 He previously also urged the individual to “come forward” as he had “got it so wrong” in relation to the Ukraine complaint, branding him “an arm of the Democrat Party”. The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward. The Fake News Media knows who he is but, being an arm of the Democrat Party, don’t want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay. Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2019 The US president insisted that the \"many people\" who listened to his July phone call with the Ukrainian president did not have any complaints about it because it was \"totally appropriate\", boasting that the Republicans have “never been more unified” than they are amid the impeachment inquiry. Many people listened to my phone call with the Ukrainian President while it was being made. I never heard any complaints. The reason is that it was totally appropriate, I say perfect. Republicans have never been more unified, and my Republican Approval Rating is now 95%! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2019 The transcript of the 25 July Trump-Zelensky conversation was released following the launch of the impeachment inquiry, with both the American and Ukrainian presidents rejecting that any pressure or inappropriate requests were made during the phone call. Donald Trump insisted that the whistleblower was partial in his complaint and that the inquiry was nothing more than a \"hoax\" aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 US presidential election.",

    "title": "Farage is not Frit!",
    "description": "Nigel Farage is absolutely correct in not standing for election. If he did stand the MSM and every two-bit comedian in the UK would turn the election in his chosen constituency into a farce.",
    "articleText": "We had it last time, with one trick pony Al Murray, the pub landlord, and that bloke dressed as a dolphin and that’s before we get on to the very serious questions about the funding of the Tory candidate which resulted in a suspended six-month sentence for one of the Conservative organisers. I know Farage has stood seven times and lost seven times but he is also Mr Brexit. The MSM are trying to change the narrative that it was Boris Johnson who won the referendum which is complete hogwash. It was Nigel who lit the flame and Nigel who inspired the forgotten masses to vote to get our country back. That is why the MSM and the commentariat were left so surprised when we voted to leave. They were disconnected then and that disconnection between the elite and the people outside the Westminster bubble is even bigger now. Farage can do much more good for the real Brexit campaign by carrying on with his radio show and building his friendship with Donald Trump rather than sitting on the back benches surrounded by the clowns and betrayers and self-serving pigs of Westminster. The bottom line is that Nigel connects with the ordinary man and woman in the street and he doesn’t need or want to be bought off with a peerage to achieve that. This is what is driving the fear in Westminster and Number 10. They know just how popular Farage is. Now the Tories are trying to spin the line that a vote for the Brexit party is a vote for Corbyn. It is nonsense as it is clear that Farage as per usual is going to attack the Labour heartlands in the Midlands and the North that Corbyn’s commie mobsters have largely betrayed. Yves Herman FILE PHOTO: Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Labour Party's Shadow Secretary of State for Departing the European Union Keir Starmer leave after a meeting with European Union's Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels, Belgium March 21, 2019. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Again, the narrative being spun is that Nigel will break Brexit vote and I must admit I fell for this at first but after reading Boris’s treaty, and that is what it is, I am now convinced that Nigel is right and Boris’s deal is just a rehash of Theresa May’s surrender document and should be rejected. Instead of so called Brexiteers attacking Farage they should be getting behind him and forcing Boris to compromise and form a pact with the Brexit Party. Idiots on twitter are showing their ignorance by saying that the Brexit party can’t win the election. Well, who said they could? Certainly not me or Farage! However, what Nigel could do is hold the balance of power, as I have been saying for months. If the DUP could do it with only ten MPs then just imagine what Nigel could do? However too many committed brexiteers are taking up the stupid mantra of, “let’s get Brexit done” but unfortunately for them they are wrong and I now agree with Nigel that, on reflection, this is not Brexit. I remember a UKIP conference years ago when Paul Nutell who was the deputy leader at the time told me that he was going to make a speech later saying that his strategy was going to be take the Northern Labour heartlands. I told him, over breakfast, he was mad and that would never work, the Labour tribe would never vote for a right-wing party. Well I was wrong and he was bang on the money and I have been thinking about this conversation these past few days. It is my confident prediction that the Brexit party will take tens of thousands of votes off Labour and will even win some seats in these areas. I also do not see enough change in the Tories for Boris to be able to form a majority government, so mark my words either just before the election or straight after Boris will be begging Nigel for a pact just like May had to with the DUP. There is going to be a hung Parliament. What the MSM and the commentariat have forgotten is that People who voted leave were not just voting about Brexit. It was a protest against the whole political class, it was the purest form of a plague on both their houses. That mood of them and us has not gone away, in fact, it has increased. The Keith Vaz story and his sleazy actions and lies and the pitiful slap on his wrist plays into this 'them and' us scenario. The whole way Bercow tried every trick in the book to thwart Brexit and the will of the people is another example. People are fed up to the back teeth of political correctness that the elite keep pushing down our throats. This ridiculous idea that calling Bideford the white town is racist, or this latest tosh from the actors’ union Equity that theatres should not use the greeting ‘Ladies and Gentlemen’ as it might upset the Trans community?! We have never voted for this nonsense and it has certainly never been in any major party’s manifesto, has it? More importantly I don’t think the electorate will or should forget the betrayal by the majority of the House of Muppets over Brexit these past three years that have got us into this mess. Instead of attacking a man who has spent over 21 years trying to get us out of the EU, people should be remembering who the real enemy is. Farage is the only modern politician who has had a single aim in his political career and actually achieved it, i.e. the referendum. It is not Farage’s fault we are still in the corrupt organisation. It is the fault of the Establishment elite of all parties who never wanted to leave in the first place. Today I have heard and read tweets from Brexiteers calling him a fraud, frit, a loser and the man who is going to stop or break Brexit. © AP Photo / PA / Danny Lawson Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage gestures on an open topped bus while on the European Election campaign trail in Sunderland, England, Saturday, May 11, 2019 These people are disgraceful and the twitter mob who are working themselves into a frenzy should pause and actually listen to what Nigel is saying and read the Boris’s deal before shouting their mouths off. I was one of them last week, I admit and I was taken in by Boris and the propaganda machine but now after a period of reflection and actually looking at the deal, I am firmly in Nigel’s camp and believe that what Boris is offering is not Brexit. So instead of whining and slagging off the man who has dedicated his life to Brexit I think every Patriot should be getting behind him and force Boris to compromise before it is too late. It is not Nigel who is going to put at risk or wreck Brexit and potentially let Comrade Corbyn into Number 10, it is Boris Johnson and his Tory mates who are still not understanding what is happening outside the Westminster bubble. I would urge you not to join in this nonsense and remember you are the people and Boris is the elite. It was the people, led by Nigel Farage, who got us the referendum and you should realise that it will be the people and Nigel who are best chance to get us out. Stand firm and don’t fall for the Political Establishment Elite propaganda. The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): A senior political leader in the Indian state of West Bengal has come under fire, inviting public ridicule for his explicit speech that attacked what he called “intellectuals eating beef”.",
    "articleText": "A controversial Bharatiya Janata Party chief from West Bengal suggested that “intellectuals” refrain from eating beef in public places, and start eating dog meat as well. He went on to attack beef eaters, saying some \"take pride in cleaning the excrements of their foreign pet dogs\". Ghosh also warned beef eaters of the dire consequences for killing and consuming cows, which is a crime. \"The cow is our mother; we stay alive by consuming cow milk. If anyone misbehaves with my mother, I will treat them the way they should be treated. On the holy soil of India killing cows and consuming beef is a crime,” ANI quoted Ghosh as saying on the occasion of Gopashtam, a Hindu festival. Comparing foreign breeds and Indian breeds of cows, he went on to say 'desi' cow milk contains gold and that is why Indian cows have gold-coloured milk. He further made a bizarre remark, saying cows of foreign breeds are “aunties” and not “gaumata” (the term describing the status of cows being equal to the status of 'mothers' in Hinduism). The speech from the senior state politician was blatant enough to fall under the scrutiny of netizens, and the latter proceeded to slam the party leader for his statement and for threatening beef eaters. Now he will decide who eats what and where, like he pays for it🙄 tell him to keep his bigotry at home. — Samir R. (@inditweetr) November 5, 2019 this is the state of our nation. ppl with such mental development become public leaders who are supposed to lead in building the nation! they exist in every party but of late the bjp seems to be having extra numbers of them. — sane_head (@Marwein_TJ) November 5, 2019 This is the sorry state of affairs that BJP is in.

Sadly the majoritarian populace is content with them. — A (@verboten_cat) November 5, 2019 Which of the cow's dung does Dilip Ghosh and the rest of BJP leaders have filled their head with? Cow mata's or cow aunty's? Probably those who can speak English have aunty's and the other have 'matas'. — Satish Kapur (@SatishKapur4) November 5, 2019 However, this is not the first time Ghosh has landed in hot water.

    "description": "While several cities in Europe have already created special traffic markings, painting classic zebra crossings in rainbow colours to pay tribute to the LGBTQ community and support equal rights, a Dutch city claims to be the first one in the world to specifically back transgender people.",
    "articleText": "The Dutch city of Almere, not far from the country’s capital Amsterdam, has opened a tri-colour pedestrian crossing to support transgender people. The crosswalk, claimed to be the first one of its kind in the world, is painted pink for girls, blue for boys, and white for those who do not feel they belong to their biological sex. The special crossing was opened during Alemere’s Winter Pride Walk, held to promote equal rights and celebrate the LGBTQ community. \"In Almere, everyone can be as he wants\", alderman (a key municipal post in the Netherlands) Jerzy Soetekouw, representing the social democrats said, as cited by the German news agency DPA. The newly-opened transgender crossing is not the first special sign of support for LGBTQ people in Almere as it already has a rainbow crosswalk. Several European cities, including another Dutch city, Maastricht, as well as London, Paris, and Hamburg also have such crosswalks. The reaction to this sign of support for transgender people has been mixed. While some applauded the move on Almere’s Facebook account, others questioned the legality of introducing a special traffic marker. “We all learned that a pedestrian crossing is black and white for the priority of all pedestrians. Does this mean that you should not give priority to all NON-transgender people and continue driving? Doesn’t this have to be adjusted to the traffic law?” one commenter posted. Another user questioned the choice of the colours and the design, writing: “I understand that rainbow flag, but who is responsible for these colours in the context of transgender? Probably one did not think about it for long. A little explanation seems desirable\". Some were more critical about the idea, suggesting it looked like a joke. Today, in many cities around the world there are zebra crossings in rainbow colours as a sign of tolerance, including places such as Maastricht, London, and Hamburg.",

    "description": "The development follows the publication of an inquiry into the 2017 incident that left 72 people dead. The report said firefighters showed courage and devotion to duty while battling the blaze, but also stressed that there had been serious deficiencies in command and control.",
    "articleText": "A member of Britain's Conservative Party, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has drawn the ire of the public over his statement that residents of Grenfell Tower lacked common sense when they agreed to follow firefighters’ instructions to \"stay put\". Mr Rees-Mogg, who is the Leader of the House of Commons, was referring to the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London, in which 72 people died and 70 were injured. The inquiry published last week said most of the victims were instructed to remain inside their flats and that the London Fire Brigade had failed to lift this advice when stairs were passable thus contributing to numerous casualties. Commenting on the inquiry, the 50-year-old politician said after reading the report he came to the conclusion that people would have been safer if they'd ignored the instructions and left the building. \"I think, if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the building. It just seems a common thing to do. And it is such a tragedy that that didn't happen\", Jacob Rees-Mogg said in an interview with LBC Radio. His statements were harshly criticised by relatives of the victims, with some demanding the politician apologise. Ahmed Chellat, who lost five family members in the fire told The Mirror: “People died on the stairs trying to leave, they couldn’t breathe. People needed help and directions, they tried to open doors and there was smoke everywhere. What is he talking about?” The chair of campaign group Justce4Grenfell Yvette Williams called Rees-Mogg’s statement \"appalling\". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would accept the results of the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Addressing relatives of the victims and survivors of the fire, who've repeatedly demanded the resignation of top fire officials, the prime minister said that justice would be done. Meanwhile, several high-ranking officials have questioned the inquiry conducted by Sir Martin-Moore-Bick. The head of Scotland’s fire service Martin Blunden cast doubt on the report’s conclusion that lives could have been saved if the London Fire Brigade had allowed people to exit the building via stairs, noting that the flammable coating of the building had hampered the rescue process. 2/3 To say that more lives could have been saved is impossible to say at this stage & it is disappointing to read such a conclusion. I do not believe blaming LFB’s Commissioner or any staff is fair or correct. I understand the desire of those mourning to apportion blame & find — Martin Blunden (@FireScot_Chief) November 3, 2019 3/3 out why. Before LFB attended it was too late; this tower block was wrapped in flammable material, it was alight, fire was spreading & compartmentation was failing. My question is how could this have been allowed to happen so that members of the public were not protected. — Martin Blunden (@FireScot_Chief) November 3, 2019 Blunden’s statement was echoed by Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, who said the inquiry did not focus on the construction of the building. The fire at the Grenfell Tower started on 14 June 2017 just before 1 a.m. due to a malfunctioning fridge-freezer and quickly spread over the building. More than 200 firefighters and 70 fire engines were involved in battling the blaze, which took the lives of 72 people. The inquiry into the incident found that the reason the fire quickly spread over the building was flammable cladding installed on the tower. The incident was Britain’s worst residential fire since the Second World War.",

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Daesh* militants are fleeing Syria and moving to ungoverned areas in northern Iraq, media reported, citing US military and commanders of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the region, who also hinted at the threat of the re-emergence of the self-proclaimed \"caliphate.\"",
    "articleText": "According to the NBC broadcaster, militants have moved to a valley that is controlled by the Kurdish Peshmerga forces on one side and by the Iraqi Armed Forces on the other. The militants are reportedly moving to uncontrolled areas between the two sides. \"They have some tunnels, they have some caves. And they are moving — especially at night,\" Gen. Sirwan Barzani, the commander of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, told the broadcaster, adding that his troops can see them moving, riding motorcycles and driving pickup trucks. According to Maj. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, deputy commander of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, militants periodically go down to nearby farms and villages to steal from the locals. \"I think it's the place where they have the designs to re-establish the physical caliphate and if they could, I think they would do it here. Syria in my mind is more of a support zone for them,\" he said. Kurdish officials estimate that about several hundred militants reside in the area and warn that the \"caliphate\" initially emerged with such numbers. In late October, US President Donald Trump announced that Daesh leader Abu Bakr Baghdadi had been killed in Syria during a special US operation. According to Trump, the number one terrorist was under the Pentagon's surveillance for some time before the conditions were ripe to eliminate him. Later, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that Russia did not have reliable information that the US military had carried out an operation to \"destroy\" Baghdadi. *Daesh - a terrorist organisation banned in Russia and a number of other countries",

    "description": "The inking of the landmark deal, an exceptional one as it involves a top-earning Chinese commercial entity, is largely in line with the economic digitalisation course set by Beijing.",
    "articleText": "China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and more specifically, its digital coin research department, has cut a deal with smartphone manufacturing giant Huawei, the company posted on its official WeChat account. Though not providing further information, Huawei noted the two had signed a “strategic cooperation agreement” following a meeting between the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, Fan Yifei, and Huawei executives held on Monday afternoon at the firm’s headquarters in Shenzhen. The deal appears to be the first example of a major company partnering with the Chinese financial institution to study the possible applications of blockchain technology. The news is in tune with a general trend announced by the Chinese government to digitalise the country’s economy, including the Reminbi as well as launch its own digital coin. This follows the country banning bitcoin in late 2013 and the closure of cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms. Incidentally, just last month, the Digital Currency Research Institute, in charge of the sweeping digital Reminbi project, published a job vacancy because it is looking for experienced tech experts to join its team. Separately, one of China's economic and financial hubs, the city of Guangzhou recently earmarked a $150 million subsidy to support “outstanding blockchain projects\", according to crypto analyst Dovey Wan. Yet, she also tweeted some excerpts from the People’s Daily, China's state newspaper indicating that those using the tech for criminal purposes would be severely punished: JUST IN People’s Daily (CCP’s official media outlet) just published another featured commentary as “Blockchain, a breaking point for China to overtake” Highlighted part really worths extra read here (attached auto translation) pic.twitter.com/y7p3p5vjxC — Dovey 以德服人 Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) November 4, 2019 Along the same lines, Huawei has also zeroed in on blockchain research, recently launching a global blockchain cloud service that may potentially come in handy for businesses. China is not the only country that is on path of economic digitalisation: Russia has been working on a range of projects to this end for the past few years, while in the EU, an association of over 200 German banks has called for a digital Euro.",

Over $4.7 trillion of the $35 trillion in wealth owned by the top 1%, now sits in bank accounts collecting near zero percent interest, it is effectively ‘dead money.’ DOUBLE DOWN asks Charles Hugh Smith how the ‘unraveling of everything that actually matters’ fits into this paradigm of far too much free money for some. He says we see the unraveling of intangible capital: the resilience of our economy, our social capital, i.e. our ability to find common ground and solve real-world problems, our sense that the playing field, while not entirely level, is not two-tiered, and our sense of economic security.

    "description": "President Donald Trump stressed last month that the American military will retain control of Syria's oil, adding that some US troops will be withdrawn, as US allies will secure the Syrian border.",
    "articleText": "The Russian Foreign Ministry stressed on Tuesday that the US decision to establish military bases in the country to \"secure\" the Syrian oil fields is illegitimate, as doing so violates international law. \"Any actions that aim to bolster the illegal military presence of the United States [in Syria] go against the international law and are unacceptable from our point of view\", Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin told reporters. American troops pulled back from several areas as Ankara launched its Operation Peace Spring on 9 October, commencing an offensive against Daesh* terrorists and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Washington and the European Union slammed the decision, introducing sanctions against Ankara, but the Turkish government continued the operation in order to create a so-called safe zone near its territory in order to keep out the SDF, which it considers to be affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), banned in the country. © AP Photo / Baderkhan Ahmad In this Monday, Oct. 28, 2019 photo, U.S. forces patrol Syrian oil fields. Kurdish forces had to withdraw from the Syria-Turkey border, later arranging a deal with Damascus, which subsequently bolstered its forces in the northern part of the country. The crisis eased after Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to establish joint patrols on the border, while Moscow also vowed to ensure that the Kurdish-led forces would retreat from the Turkish border. At the same time, Washington and Ankara negotiated a ceasefire between the Turkish Army and the Kurdish militia in the region, which later became permanent. * Daesh (ISIL/ISIS/IS/Islamic State) is a terrorist organisation banned in Russia",

    "description": "Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier sparked rumours over a possible rematch with Donald Trump in 2020, and now the failed Democratic candidate is giving advice to fellow politicians about potential strategies to win the upcoming presidential election.",
    "articleText": "Former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has urged Democratic Party supporters to choose a nominee who will be able to win the Electoral College in 2020 and called on them to “close ranks” behind the chosen Democratic candidate, notwithstanding initial preferences in the primary, as quoted by The Hill. Clinton’s comments were made during an event in Denver devoted to the discussion of her book “The Book of Gutsy Women” co-authored with her daughter Chelsea Clinton, who appeared alongside her mother during the presentation. “We have to hope that whoever ends up nominated can win the Electoral College”, Hillary Clinton said. “I think several of our candidates could win the popular vote but as I know ... that's not enough\", the former US secretary of state added. Hillary Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic nominee running against Donald Trump, won the popular vote among the American public but failed to secure an Electoral College victory, meaning that she failed to gain a majority of the 538 electors established by the US Constitution, thus paving way for Donald Trump’s presidential victory. Netizens were eager to point out how Clinton’s pledge ran contrary to her 2016 stance. Wow. What amazing brilliance. Nominate someone who can win. As opposed to what went on in '16. Well, no shit. — Crusty White 'Residue' for Bernie2020! (@JPotter514) November 5, 2019 \"Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to pick a candidate who can win the Electoral College\". As opposed to 2016... — Duke Lang (@DukeDALang) November 5, 2019 Said the One who Lost the Electoral College. Hush! — Jamie Tolbert \"Feel the Bern\" Franklin (@JamieTFranklin) November 5, 2019 The former presidential candidate also said during the event that Democrats do not have “a choice” in 2020 except to “win”, while claiming that the current administration in Washington is “undermining” the American system. She urged Democratic Party supporters to refrain from voting for a third party, even if their preferred candidate in the primaries does not get nominated to run for president. “Do not let anyone you know vote third party\", Clinton said. Hillary Clinton was the Democrats candidate after she beat out another popular party nominee, Bernie Sanders, during the primaries in 2016. Sanders also received widespread support but later moved to publicly endorse his opponent’s candidacy. Many then argued that Sanders, who is now vying for the Democratic nomination to defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, could have won the Electoral College had he been selected as the Democratic Party nominee instead of Hillary Clinton. Some Twitter users pointed out that Clinton’s comments just highlighted the controversy and hinted towards her support for Bernie Sanders, while others suggested that the remarks showed that other Democratic Party nominees who are currently leading the polls, such as Joe Biden, couldn’t be regarded as solid opponents to Donald Trump. Glad to see she's finally coming around on @BernieSanders and saying everyone should have voted for him. — Frank Hopper (@ProgressiveSAHD) November 5, 2019 Oh Damn. She's practically endorsing @BernieSanders — Kyle (B)erney (@kyle_erney) November 5, 2019 It damn sure won’t be Biden. — L. Y. (@Earthguy6) November 5, 2019 Others earlier suggested that Hillary Clinton was planning to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination race, following the former secretary of state’s “don’t tempt me” tweet in an exchange with Donald Trump, after the US president suggested that Clinton could enter the presidential race. While the Democratic presidential polls are currently led by Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren, speculations about Hillary Clinton trying her luck again have not been confirmed.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik) The crackdown kicks off a year after the agency was hit by a slew of bank scams, with the Punjab National Bank scam, involving over $2.1 billion in funds, the primary focus of both the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).",
    "articleText": "Tightening the noose around financial con-men, India’s top investigative agency the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday carried out the biggest operation to date in a $1 billion bank fraud case. A senior CBI official said the agency is conducting searches at around 169 locations across the country. The Official added that the searches involve hundreds of agency officials in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Chandigarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telengana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Dadra and Nager Haveli. The CBI has registered around 35 cases related to bank fraud involving over $1 billion. The agency has carried out several raids against fraudsters since the beginning of the year. Last month, another bank fraud case came into the light in Mumbai - the country's financial capital, in which over $1 billion cash of depositors' funds got stuck in the banking system. Various reports suggest that at least eight people have committed suicide in distress when they were unable to withdraw their hard-earned money from Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank after the banking regulator put a limit on withdrawals. India's Finance Ministry has claimed the country’s main internal probe agency has been examining 847 cases related to bank fraud, registered since May 2014. In July this year, the government claimed that banks had reported $6 billion in fraud over the last three years. Of the 847 cases, 371 cases are currently under investigation, 450 cases are being tried, 14 cases have been closed, four cases have resulted in convictions, and a court has ordered a stay in two cases.

    "description": "According to a Trump family biographer, the real stories happening inside the White House are much more intriguing than those made up by haters, and that the deeply affectionate personal relationship between the couple is definitely worth commenting on.",
    "articleText": "Doug Wead, a historian and writer who spent two years with the Trump family as he was writing his book titled “Inside Trump’s White House: The Real Story of His Presidency\", said on Monday’s airing of “Fox & Friends” that a great many claims about the first family are nothing but fabricated stories. For instance, Wead referred to the reports coming in time and again that the president and his wife Melania might be estranged as “totally false\". Per the author of the biographical work, despite Melania's impression of somewhat distancing herself from her better half in public, Trump himself brings up his wife’s name regardless of the subject he's talking about. Wead referred to them as tender lovers that playfully tease each other: “They are a couple. Well, [Melania’s] so dignified and she handles herself with such grace. In every conversation, [Donald Trump] brings up Melania. Melania this, Melania that\", Wead said. He went on to recount a scene in his book when the Secret Service would not allow the first lady to accompany the president into a combat zone to address the troops. However, after she verbally opposed the arrangement, she was allowed to attend alongside POTUS: “She says, 'If my husband is in danger, I will share the danger'. And so on Christmas night, they fly out together to be with the troops\", Wead recalled. As he writes in his op-ed for Fox News, although publicly the whole family talks about what a great privilege it is to serve the country, in the close-knit family circle, they retain no illusions about the tensions they go through, with the latter turning into a subject of Trump’s sarcastic remarks: “Melania, honey, look at this incredible journey I have brought you on\", Wead cited POTUS as saying, while he recounted that Melania would typically answer: “And she’s like, ‘Oh yeah, thank you so much'. “It’s hilarious. I love it\". While speaking about fabricated tales, Wead stressed it is the real stories that are much more gripping, boasting that the president had even allowed him to read his private correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as well as shared his theories on who had pursued the Russian collusion conspiracy and why. During Wead’s two years of interviewing the Trumps, a new book saw the light of day claiming to have the real story on how Donald Trump chose Mike Pence as his running mate, but, according to the writer, it was completely false. “Want to know what really happened?” Eric Trump asked him, the author recounted. “And he then related the details of that night he and his father had steaks together with Mike and Karen Pence, at the Capital Grille at the Conrad Hotel in Indianapolis\", Wead continued, moving on to cite Jared Kushner as commenting on what’s going on inside the White House: “There are two kinds of staffers\", Kushner told me. “Those who want to help Trump save the world, and those who want to save the world from Trump\". There has been a lot of media speculation about the reportedly tense relationship between the first couple. Most recently, Trump himself reportedly puzzled attendees during a fundraising event, when he took a veiled swipe at his wife Melania lamenting she would hardly cry her eyes out if he were fatally shot. However, it didn't cause anything but laughter and a bit of dismay among the public.",

    "description": "Since Donald Trump announced his decision to run for president in 2015 dozens of women have accused him of sexual abuse. The purported incidents have spanned decades. Donald Trump has denied all the accusations.",
    "articleText": "A US journalist, who asserted in her memoir that President Donald Trump raped her in a New York city store 23 years ago, has filed a defamation lawsuit against him for his denial of the attack. In court documents E Jean Carroll, who has run the \"Ask E. Jean\" column in Elle magazine since 1993, says the 45th president has made a series of \"false\" statements and \"smeared her integrity, honesty, and dignity\". E Jean Carroll firs detailed the incident of alleged rape, which she claims occurred between the autumn of 1995 and spring of 1996 at a Bergdorf Goodman store, in a New York magazine article featuring excerpts of her memoir released in June entitled \"What Do We Need Men For: A Modest Proposal\". Jean asserts that President Trump assaulted her in a dressing room after the two engaged in a playful banter, with the businessman-turned-politician kissing the journalist before undressing and raping her. \"The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips. I am so shocked I shove him back and start laughing again. He seizes both my arms and pushes me up against the wall a second time, and, as I become aware of how large he is, he holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights\", E Jean Carrol wrote in her memoir President Trump vehemently denied the allegations, saying Ms Carroll totally lied when she accused him of rape. Trump noted that she did that to increase sales of her book. \"I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened. I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is — it’s just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that\", President Trump said in an interview with The Hill. Her article in New York magazine also featured a photo of Trump and Carroll standing together with their then spouses. The 45th president dismissed the photo saying: \"standing with my coat on in a line — give me a break — with my back to the camera. I have no idea who she is\". This and other statements by Trump about the alleged rape prompted Ms Carroll to file a defamation lawsuit. \"The rape of a woman is a violent crime; compounding that crime with acts of malicious libel is abhorrent. Yet that is what Defendant Donald J Trump did to Plaintiff E Jean Carroll\", said the court documents. The lawsuit noted that the columnist had remained silent for decades over concerns that she would “lose everything” if she accused the real estate mogul of rape and decided to go public only after she witnessed a shift in the US public’s stance towards this issue following a string accusations against prominent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, which later spawned the #MeToo movement against physical and sexual violence. The lawsuit states: “It suddenly seemed possible that even Trump could be held to account\". Dozens of women have accused US President Donald Trump of alleged sexual misconduct since he launched his presidential campaign in 2015. Trump has denied all the accusations.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Bangkok on Monday for the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) at the 14th East Asia Summit (EAS).",
    "articleText": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come up with an Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative aimed at conserving and sustainably using the maritime domain and making meaningful efforts to create a safe, secure, and stable maritime domain. The proposal was made on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit, as officials of the quadrilateral grouping consisting of India, Australia, the USA and Japan met. Addressing the press following the meeting, India's Ministry of External Affairs Secretary (East) Vijay Thakur Singh, said focus areas will include creating partnerships among interested countries in several realms, ranging from \"enhancing maritime security to preserving and sustainably using marine resources, building capacity, disaster prevention and management, as well as working together in trade, and maritime transport\". \"The officials reaffirmed their commitment towards a free, open, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific Region based on shared values and principles and respect for international law\", the official said. The Indian prime minister has also proposed an East Asia Summit seminar on maritime security in Chennai in 2020. The ministry's official said that leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen EAS and adopted three statements, including on creating a partnership for sustainability, combating the spread of illicit drugs and cooperation to combat transnational crimes. Earlier, the US State Department released a progress report on the implementation of the whole government strategy for the Indo-Pacific region and said its strategic partnership with India is \"reaching new heights\". India plays a critical role in the future of the Indo-Pacific region, the report said. On Monday, India decided to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), saying that the proposed mega trade deal did not fully reflect \"the basic spirit and the agreed guiding principles of the agreement.\" India is taking a tough stand because imports from China are likely to flood Indian markets, resulting in increased competition for domestic manufacturers. The RCEP negotiators hope to sign the deal in 2020 with the new tariff regime kicking in from 2022. The 16 countries involved account for half the world's population and 32.2 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product, equivalent to $22.6 trillion. The RCEP comprises the 10-nation Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc and Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and China.",

    "title": "Fury, Warnings Over Sweden’s Failure to Banish Dangerous Islamists for 'Humanitarian Reasons'",
    "description": "One of the Islamist preachers allowed to walk free despite a previous expulsion decision has been identified as a key figure in Sweden's extremist environment and is known for hailing Daesh* and advocating segregation.",
    "articleText": "A total of six hardcore Islamists of immigrant background previously labelled a “security threat” and slated for expulsion from Sweden have been released, prompting strong reactions. The reason for the six men, who have been in the custody of Sweden's Security Police (Säpo) since spring, to remain in Sweden despite being classified as highly dangerous is that they reportedly risk persecution in their respective home countries, such as Iraq and Egypt, the newspaper Expressen reported. The designated Islamists have hereby been set free “in anticipation of a change in conditions in their home countries”. While their release implies they are free to continue spreading their teachings, they are expected to be monitored by Säpo. Expressen described them as “a speckled group” representing the Salafist underground, united in their affirmation of violent Islamism. 53-year-old Iraqi-born Abo Raad, who was previously identified as the leading figure in Sweden's radical Islamic environment, is known for hailing Daesh's military successes in Iraq and maintaining a tax-financed webpage that among other things advocates segregation, calling on Muslims to limit their contact with non-Muslims. His son was sentenced for death threats to the editor-in-chief of the local newspaper Gefle Dagblad for its investigative publications. As Raad went back to Gävle Mosque, Swedish national broadcaster SVT ran a piece titled “Hug Party”, in which Raad was described as a “rock star”. The report sparked strong reactions and was later altered. “This article may be among the most disgusting creations I've ever seen from public service. SVT calls an Islamist whom Säpo estimated to be a threat to the security of the kingdom a “rock star” and talks about about a “hug party”. Denna artikel kan vara bland de mest motbjudande skapelser jag någonsin sett från public service. En islamist som av Säpo bedöms hota rikets säkerhet kallar SVT för ”rockstjärna” och skriver om ”kramkalas”. https://t.co/NTBdiWlyCW — Jonas Andersson (@JonAndSD) 1 ноября 2019 г. According to security expert Hans Brun, this is a dilemma between the security of citizens and the security of the to-be-expelled imams. “Very many countries would say that their security is more important”, Brun told Expressen. Eskilstuna Imam Abd al Haqq Kielan, who has long fought Islamic extremism, warned of an increased risk of radicalisation. “They are coming back as martyrs”, he told the newspaper Aftonbladet. “In a way, you open the gates to other like-minded people. If you are going somewhere in Europe, Sweden appears to be a good alternative. The message is 'the table is set'”, he added. Sweden's leading terror researcher Magnus Ranstorp of the National Defence College called to expel the imams, as previously ordered. According to him, their release will affect Sweden's security for years to come. “Now their halos have been further refined in their environment\", Ranstorp said. Liberal-conservative Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson called the development “a catastrophe” and blamed it on Stefan Löfven's government. The number of Muslims in Sweden has been estimated at 800,000, or 8 percent of the country's population of about 10 million. A recent count by the Institute for Future Studies numbered 785 Islamic extremists in Sweden, which previously emerged as one of the biggest \"jihadist exporters\" per capita, providing around 300 \"foreign fighters\" to the Middle East. * Daesh (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Islamic State) is a terrorist organisation banned in Russia and other countries",

    "articleText": "The Mexican security minister stated Tuesday that nine people, three women and six children, have been killed in an ambush on a Mormon family in Northern Mexico. The official further stated that the murdered people travelling in a convoy, could have been confused with criminal groups fighting for control in the region. US President Donald Trump has turned to Twitter amid the ongoing investigation to lambast those responsible for the crime and to propose US support for Mexico. ....monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively.

Earlier in the day, media said the Mexican authorities had deployed national police and military forces to the northern state of Sonora bordering the US following reports of at least seven US citizens, including children having been killed. The reports of the massacre emerged late on Monday as Lafe Langford Jr, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has a major presence in the region, posted a statement on Facebook, saying that a mother and four of her children had been killed by drug cartels. According to Mr Lafe Langford Jr, Rhonita Miller and her 4 children were shot up and burned to death in a vehicle. Mr Lafe Langford Jr has been updating the information as the situation develops, saying that two other women who were previously missing - Christina Langford and Dawna Langford and their children have also been killed.",

English actor and comedian Ricky Gervais commented on the issue, by claiming that he was going to dress up as the “brave female activist” this Halloween season and therefore was in no need of waxing in order to pass for her. “I was going to dress up as something weird and creepy for my Halloween party, but I’m bucking the trend this year and I’m going as brave female activist Jessica Yaniv\", Gervais wrote in a tweet.

At that time, the transgender woman picked on Shepherd for having a “loose vagina” after giving birth and mocked her for having a reproductive abnormality, to which Shepherd replied that at least she has female genitalia, while calling Yaniv an “ugly fat man”. The Canadian free speech champion was then suspended from Twitter, while Yaniv remained on the platform despite her comments, which many users and public figures found unfair. © Jessica Yaniv / Twitter Jessica Yaniv Peterson, who has been a longtime critic of mainstream political correctness and a bill mandating the use of gender-neutral pronouns for people who do not identify as male or female, also supported Shepherd two years ago when she was disciplined by Wilfrid Laurier University over showing students a debate involving Peterson discussing the use of gender-neutral pronouns as part of a class discussion. Despite Shepherd claiming that her position on gender issues was neutral, she was slammed by other professors for creating a toxic environment in the classroom and “playing a speech by Hitler”. For his part Peterson, who defines himself as an individualist and a promoter of free speech, has denied all the accusations brought up against him and sued the professors involved for defamation.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): With the recent controversy over an alleged Israeli spyware-attack via WhatsApp on several Indian political leaders, social activists and journalists still in the news, speculation about a malware attack on an Indian nuclear plant has come to the forefront, raising questions about cybersecurity in India.",
    "articleText": "A South Korean cybersecurity firm claims that the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in southern India’s Tamil Nadu state was attacked by North Korean “DTrack” malware in an attempt to obtain internal information about “thorium-based nuclear power”. Located off the Bay of Bengal in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu state, the power plant is the single largest nuclear power station in India. We have confirmed that one of the hackers who attacked India's nuclear energy sector is using a North Korean self-branded computer produced and used only in the North Korea. And the IP used by one of the hackers was from Pyongyang, North Korea. This is more valuable than malware. pic.twitter.com/xqusmMWWY7 — IssueMakersLab (@issuemakerslab) November 4, 2019 In its analysis, Seoul-based IssueMake Labs also asserted that along with the plant, senior Indian nuclear scientists including former Chairman of Atomic Energy Commission of India, Anil Kakodkar and former Chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, S A Bhardwaj – were also targeted by the hackers. Also, the DPRK hackers sent email containing malware to the chairman(not now *ex-*) of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board(AERB) of India. And he was the Technical Director of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL). He's an expert on the AHWR reactor (thorium-based). pic.twitter.com/5BjlGenPhr — IssueMakersLab (@issuemakerslab) November 2, 2019 Addressing the speculations surrounding the malware-attack rumours, on 29 October, KKNPP issued a statement claiming that the plant’s control system was not connected to any cyber network outside its periphery. Just one day after denying the cyber attacks, on 30 October, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCI) admitted that their systems were, in fact, infected by foreign malware. The experts also alleged that North Korean hackers have continuously been attempting to breach nuclear facilities and accounts of top nuclear scientists to obtain confidential nuclear-power information from India.

The espionage toolchain linked to a destructive wiper. The intrusions weren't destructive because the actor decided against it. We were at its mercy.

    "description": "The statement comes just one day after the head of Iran's nuclear programme, Ali Akbar Salehi, announced that the country is now operating 60 IR-6 advanced centrifuges, a violation of the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).",
    "articleText": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that the Islamic Republic will start injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges on Wednesday, stressing that the signatories to the 2015 Nuclear Agreement have to implement the deal within two months to stop Tehran from suspending its obligations under the accord. He also noted that all the decisions taken by Iran are reversible, underscoring that the nation will comply with the nuclear deal if the other parties to the accord do the same. © Photo: an official website of the Iranian Presidency office President Hassan Rouhani listens to explanations on new nuclear achievements at a ceremony to mark \"National Nuclear Day,\" in Tehran, Iran, Monday, April 9, 2018 Under the JCPOA, Iran is supposed to repurpose its Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant as a centre for the production of stable isotopes, refraining from enriching uranium and leaving Natanz as the only uranium enrichment facility. Nuclear Deal in Danger This is yet another step taken by Iran since May when the country stated it would stop complying with some of the pact's restrictions, urging European countries to shield Tehran from unilateral US sanctions. Washington imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic just one year before Tehran decided on this course of action following US President Donald Trump's criticism of the JCPOA and call to negotiate another agreement with Iran. Trump also urged other sides of the agreement to follow his move but Russia, China, France, Germany, the UK, and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to the accord, calling on both the US and Iran to stop the escalation. Slippery Slope for Washington and Tehran Controversy over the nuclear deal is a principal issue in US-Iran relations, but not the only one, as both nations have clashed on various occasions over the years. Washington and Tehran have repeatedly accused each other of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the situation in the Middle East.

    "description": "If auctioned off, the 900 bottles of elite century-old alcohol with a dramatic story may fetch a mind-boggling $6 million.",
    "articleText": "Dozens of crates containing historic brandy and liqueur worth tens of millions of kronor have been salvaged from a shipwreck in the Åland Sea. On 19 May 1917, at the height of World War One, Swedish steamer S/S Kyros set its course for Petrograd, which Saint Petersburg was called at that time, with 50 cases of cognac and 15 cases of liqueur from France to Russia through neutral Swedish territory. The goods are believed to have been intended for the circle of Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, and were expected to be delivered in 1916. However, off the Baltic island of Åland in today's Finland, it was sunk by the German submarine UC-58, as alcohol was considered illicit trafficking at that time. While the crew was picked up by another ship and managed to return home unscathed, the spirits were left at the bottom of the sea. Since the wreck is located in international waters in the Finnish economic zone, anyone has the right to salvage the cargo. While the shipwreck was discovered some 20 years ago, a successful salvaging operation by Ocean X Sweden and Icelandic Ocean Research on board a research vessel called Deepsea Worker only happened recently. One of the reasons is that over the years, the site and the wreck itself were flattened by fishing trawls and became a risk for divers. Owing to Deepsea Worker's special robots, however, no fewer than 600 bottles of brandy (50 boxes of twelve bottles each) and 300 bottles of liqueur (15 boxes of 20 bottles), were retrieved. Посмотреть эту публикацию в Instagram The last shipment of rare liquors for Tzar Nicholas II’s Russia, is now recovered! A search and salvage project that started 20 years ago is now completed. It was on the 22nd October the salvage vessel “Deepsea Worker”, arrived in Sweden with a shipload of more than 100-year old cognac and liqueur, brought up from the Swedish steamer “s/s Kyros”! Ocean X Team and iXplorer cooperated with the special equipped salvage vessel “Deepsea Worker” to be able to salvage the bottles of “De Haartman & Co”-cognac and “Benedictine”-liqueur (now days owned by Bacardi) from 77 meters depth between Sweden and Finland at international waters. It was 50 cases of cognac and 15 cases of liqueur that were supposed to be delivered from France to St Petersburg (former Petrograd), Russia, through neutral Sweden already in December 1916. Due to a heavy ice situation in the Sea of Bothnia (the sea between Sweden and Finland) the transport were delayed till May 1917. “s/s Kyros” met its dramatic fate though when being stopped and controlled by the German submarine “UC58”. The captain of the submarine decided to sink “s/s Kyros” because that parts of the cargo were considered as contraband by the Germans. “S/s Kyros” crew were transferred to a nearby ship and later they all returned safe to Sweden. The wreck of “s/s Kyros” has during the years been heavily damaged by fishing trawls and trawl boards. Several times since the first discovery back in 1999 has the wreck been cleared from nets to make it possible for divers and unmanned underwater vehicles (ROV’s) to access the wreck. The importance of this event cannot be overemphasized – it’s not only a find of rare cognac and liqueur but also a part of history of the former imperial Russia. #oceanx #oceanxteam #congac #brandy #bacardi #benedictine #liqueur #france #1917 #kyros #russia #ocean #diving #finland #navy #spirits #vintage #vin #balticsea Публикация от Ocean X Team (@oceanxteam) 25 Окт 2019 в 3:18 PDT The well-corked bottles are intact, bar the labels. The brandy is by De Haartman & Co, a company that no longer exists. The liqueur is classic Bénédictine, a brand currently sold by Bacardi. “We have sent individual bottles for analysis in Sweden and Moscow. The rest is stored in a dark, damp and cool place in a secret place”, diver Peter Lindberg told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri. The find appears to be so valuable that even the approximate price range is difficult to calculate. According to Lindberg, though, a realistic price is SEK 50,000–100,000 ($5,250–10,500) per bottle of brandy and SEK 10,000-20,000 ($1,050–$2,100) per bottle of liqueur. The find may fetch up to SEK 60 million ($6.3 million). To maximise the profit, the batch will likely be partitioned and sold piece by piece. Peter Lindberg is famous for having previously salvaged about 2,200 champagne bottles from the the cargo ship Jönköping, which sank in 1916.",

The abducted Indians were engaged in building a road project in that country. “Unfortunately, one of the Indian nationals died in the custody of the Arakan Army due to a heart attack. According to information available, he was a chronic diabetes patient. The released Indian nationals, along with the dead body of the deceased, have reached Sittwe and will be leaving for Yangon today for the onward journey to India,” said a spokesperson of India’s Federal Home Ministry. The spokesperson said these five Indians along with a member of Myanmar Parliament, two local transporters and two speedboat operators were abducted on their way back from Paletwa in Chin State to Kyauktaw in Rakhine state on Sunday 03 November. The Arakan Army, an insurgent group, based in Rakhine state in Myanmar along the Bangladesh border, is the armed wing of the United League of Arakan, lead by a former army officer. Their stated objective is to ‘protect Arakan people and establish peace, justice, freedom and development.’ According to some reports, the group has a strength of 10,000 with a huge support base in Rakhine State. This is the first time the rebels captured foreign workers in the resource-rich region, which has taken up several infrastructure projects linking India and Myanmar. India is constructing two sections of the 1400-kilometre long India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway in a bid to boost trade ties with countries in the east.",

    "title": "‘Witch Hunt’ a-la Brits? UK's Johnson Accused of Evading Publication of 'Russian Meddling' Report",
    "description": "Boris Johnson has reportedly blocked the publication of a dossier cleared by British intelligence that looked into Russia’s alleged role in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Downing Street has asserted it is a common procedure whereby it takes the government up to six weeks to clear the findings of such reports to make sure they can be made public.",
    "articleText": "A number of parliamentarians found fault with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday night, accusing him of spearheading a diplomatic cover-up after No. 10 delayed the publication of a 50-page report looking into alleged Russian involvement in British politics and the Tories in particular. Downing Street, for its part, has made it clear that the dossier from the intelligence and security committee should not be published before the snap elections on 12 December, The Guardian reported. However, the committee’s chairman, Dominic Grieve, referred to the move as “jaw dropping” saying no reason for the refusal had been provided. While the report, said to be based not only on analysis from UK intelligence agencies, but third-party experts like former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, who previously dug up a dismissed dossier on Donald Trump, his win in the 2016 vote, and Russia, first needs to go through a final clearance from the prime minister’s office, Downing Street asserted. Sources stated, as cited by The Guardian, that a typical sign-off takes six weeks. “There are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these\", a government spokesman noted. Meanwhile, the move has to be undertaken before Parliament is dissolved on Tuesday if it is to be published before the December vote. The dossier is purported to have already been approved by the intelligence agencies themselves as part of a long clearance process that kicked off in late March. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October, and was expected to sign off on the report by the end of last week. The committee’s chairman, Dominic Grieve, brought up the protocol to follow on the matter: “The protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not, it should be published\". The dossier purportedly examines alleged attempts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum, while members of the committee, which holds secret meetings citing the sensitivity of its work, stated it wanted to advise to introduce greater overall safeguards ahead of the December poll. Ministers have argued that there are no examples of fulfilled Russian interference in UK elections, but Ian Lucas, a Labour MP who sits on the culture media and sport select committee said that this needed to be properly tested: “This decision looks like it is designed to avoid proper scrutiny of what we actually know\". One of the persons mentioned in the dossier is Sergey Nalobin, who served as the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in London from 2010 to 2015 and negotiated the reception of a parliamentary group, the Conservative Friends of Russia. Despite previous claims of having been expelled from London, reports, including a November 2017 article by The Observer and The Guardian turned out to be false, as the UK Foreign Office later confirmed that “Mr Sergey Nalobin was not expelled from the UK, but left the UK upon the expiry of his vignette [a kind of visa]'\". The note was added by the Guardian to its initial story on 22 February 2018. Allegations that Russian money has been accumulated in the Tory Party via Russian immigrants in the UK making donations, were also heard by the committee, with the Tories having consistently denied receiving money in an improper way. While the British government has more than once accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 national referendum on the UK's withdrawal from the EU by using fake accounts on social networks, Facebook, which has conducted multiple investigations into the matter, weighed in on the debate, stressing for its part that it found \"absolutely no evidence\" to back up the claims. Likewise, according to a recent Buzzfeed report on the aforementioned dossier draft and it sources, UK intelligence agencies have “categorically” found no evidence the Kremlin interfered in the outcome of the Brexit referendum and the 2017 general election. The dossier comes amidst a breakthrough development in British domestic policies, which saw a snap general election approved by the UK Parliament's House of Commons early last week, a day after Brussels okayed another deadline extension for the UK. EU negotiators gave London three months, until 31 January 2020, to ratify Johnson’s Brexit deal.",

    "description": "If there’s anyone who can compete with PewDiePie and Kylie Jenner in setting Twitter ablaze it’s Elon Musk, so you can imagine what happened when the 48-year-old engineer and business maverick announced he would abandon the social media platform.",
    "articleText": "Netizens, stop eating Xanax because tech visionary Elon Musk has returned online after a 4-day self-imposed exile. Musk, who uses his Twitter account to make announcements about and discuss his companies’ projects with social media users and of course post memes, shocked his 29 million army of followers on 1 November, when he praised Reddit and cast doubt on Twitter, announcing he would be going offline. Going offline — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 1, 2019 His tweet caused waves of comments from social media users asking what had prompted him to abandon Twitter with other netizens begging him to stay. But on 5 November the tech visionary returned online and retweeted a SpaceX video from 3 November showing tests of the company’s upgraded parachute system for its Crew Dragon aircraft. The video demonstrates how Mark 3 systems can safely land aircraft in the event of a parachute failure. This was the 13th successful test in a row. Netizens were overwhelmed with joy after seeing Musk return to the social media platform. Disappearances & Twitter Troubles Incidentally, this is not the first time Musk has “disappeared” from Twitter. In June, the Tesla CEO announced that he had deleted his account although it remained active. In October, Musk tweeted he would go offline for a few days without giving any reason. CC BY-SA 2.0 / Joseph Thornton / Tesla Model S Fog Lights 'Low Gear': Elon Musk Feuds with Top Gear After It Posted Video of Porsche Taycan Beating Tesla Model S What prompted his November self-imposed exile is still unclear. Musk’s online activity sometimes gets him in big trouble. His beef with a British caver over Musk’s concept of a mini-submarine led to a lawsuit, while his tweet in August of 2018 in which he announced plans to take “Tesla private” resulted in the US Securities and Exchange Commission fining the tech visionary and Tesla $20 million each and Musk stepping down as the company’s chairman.",

    "description": "Of the over 18,000 Brits residing in Denmark, an increasing number have been switching to Danish citizenship.",
    "articleText": "The number of British citizens applying for Danish citizenship has seen a huge rise during the past two years, following the 2016 Brexit referendum. Since 2017, the number of Brits turned Danish citizens under the country's citizenship law has skyrocketed from 134 to 489, Denmark's immigration ministry reported. “There has been a large increase in the number of British citizens applying for Danish citizenship. I believe the increase is because of Brexit”, Immigration and Integration Minister Mattias Tesfaye said, as quoted by the newspaper Jyllands-Posten. While stressing his pleasure to welcome aspiring Danish citizens, Tesfaye emphasised that Danish legislation in the event of a no-deal Brexit is already in place. “As such, the approximately 18,500 British citizens [living in Denmark] can continue with their lives in Denmark regardless of whether they have applied for Danish citizenship\", he continued. Another explanation for the surge in citizenship applications by Brits is that Denmark in 2015 allowed dual nationality in a marked shift of policy. This is likely to have spurred some of the more hesitant British expatriates to apply for naturalisation in other countries without having to give up their UK passports. A no deal Brexit appears to have been taken off the table, at least for the time being, as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a remarkable u-turn, abandoning his initial “do or die” drive to abandon the EU with or without a deal on 31 October, instead opting for a new deal with the EU he called “fantastic”. However, as the new deal wasn't passed by Parliament, a general election is now scheduled on 12 December. A new Brexit deadline has been accepted by the EU and set for 31 January 2020.",

    "articleText": "\"I was pleased to know that yesterday 15 RCEP member states completed the negotiations as a whole, and I hope that the agreement will be signed and will enter into force soon\", Xi said. Earlier, an official representative of the Thai government, where the ASEAN summit was held, told reporters that the agreement was likely to be signed in February 2020. Xi also stressed during the opening ceremony that China intended to further facilitate access to its market for foreign investment and improve the country's business climate to create favourable conditions for foreign companies to work in China. He added that China would continue to actively increase imports of foreign goods and services, as well as reduce duties and various costs. © AFP 2019 / HOANG DINH NAM Delegates and performers sing the ASEAN anthem during the opening ceremony of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) 49th annual ministerial meeting in Vientiane on July 24, 2016.

The agreement is viewed as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was signed by Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States in February 2016. The deal never took effect as Washington withdrew from it in January 2017.

    "description": "On Monday, the US State Department said it had formally notified the United Nations of Washington’s decision to pull out from the Paris Climate Agreement. A country is allowed to withdraw from the agreement one year after making their announcement.",
    "articleText": "Numbers The Paris Agreement, signed and entered into force in 2016, is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), a 1992 treaty that seeks to \"stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\". As of March 2019, 195 UNFCCC member states had signed the agreement. Of those 195, 187 states and the EU have either ratified or acceded to the agreement and are considered \"parties\" to the agreement. In September, Russia ratified the agreement. Other parties include China, India, and the US – the three nations with the largest greenhouse gas emissions. According to October 2019 data from the Union of Concerned Scientists, China contributes up to 29 percent of all global CO2 emissions and the US contributes up to 16 percent. India’s share is 7 percent, and Russia’s is 5 percent. Goal The parties to the agreement are seeking to limit the global temperature increase in the 21st century to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The parties also seek to further reduce the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees per century, according to the agreement’s wording. The agreement is binding, but the language says all parties vow to comply in a “non-adversarial and non-punitive” manner, which means countries that fail to keep their pledges cannot be penalised under the agreement. To achieve this goal, all parties are required to announce their “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and report every five years on emissions and efforts taken to reduce them. Each consecutive NDC must represent a progression beyond the previous one and each nation’s report shall undergo an international technical expert review. The parties to the agreement vow to adhere to the principles of transparency and accountability. In addition, a collective stocktaking will take place to assess global progress on emissions every five years. Cooperation The agreement allows countries to cooperate in their efforts to reduce emissions. Developed countries are obliged to support the efforts of developing countries. Developed countries are obliged to report on financial support to developing countries and submit plans for future support every two years. The agreement establishes a Climate Finance Mechanism, including a Green Climate Fund that serves the agreement. Developed countries vow to achieve a concrete figure of $100 billion every year to be provided to developing countries by 2020. Progress According to Encyclopedia Britannica, progress on achieving the accord's goals has been mixed. China, which contributes the most emissions, claimed it had made great strides and said it had achieved its 2020 goals in 2017. The EU reported in 2018 that all of its member states had fallen behind. Sweden was the most successful with a 77-percent achievement of effectiveness. The article notes that US progress on the agreement is unclear. While some reports indicate that the country’s climate policy, which has taken a sharp backward turn under the Trump administration, prevents the country from achieving its goals, individual states and cities have defiantly adopted stringent emissions regulations of their own, allowing the US as a whole to stay on track. Despite international efforts, global greenhouse gas emissions remained the same between 2014-2016, but rose again, increasing by 1.6 percent in 2017 and by 2.7-3.4 percent in 2018, according to data provided by the Global Carbon Project and the Rhodium Group. US Withdrawal Under the agreement's terms, the US cannot withdraw before 4 November 2020, four years after the agreement was signed. The Trump administration made its required formal announcement to leave at the first possible occasion. Until the withdrawal takes effect, the US is obliged to maintain its commitments to the agreement, including reporting its emissions to the United Nations. A memo obtained by the Huffington Post, which is believed to originate from the US State Department legal office, points out that first emissions reports are scheduled for “at least 2021 or 2022\", and therefore the US “would not have any Paris Agreements to fulfill in the meantime\". Any \"attempts to withdraw from the Paris Agreement outside of the above-described withdrawal provisions would be inconsistent with international law and would not be accepted internationally\", the memo says.",

    "articleText": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to announce the fourth stage of nuclear obligations' reduction. The immediate details of the measures involved and the contents are not yet known, but the spokesman for Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi has previously stated that Tehran did not have many options that fit into the nuclear agreement, hinting about possible measures for a nuclear facility in Fordo. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) suggests that Iran will repurpose its Fordo former uranium enrichment plant as a center for the production of stable isotopes, refraining from enriching uranium and leaving Natanz as the only uranium enrichment facility. In the meantime, the Iranian authorities have not yet disclosed which direct obligations they intended to refuse from, and did not specify whether the fourth stage of the nuclear obligations' reduction would be the last. In September, Iran started the third stage of rolling back nuclear obligations under the JCPOA. The gradual reduction of nuclear obligation was announced on the first anniversary of the US unilateral pullout from the 2015 Iran unclear deal on 8 May. Tehran then announced that it would start abandoning some parts of its nuclear obligations every 60 days unless European signatories to the deal ensured Iran's interests under the agreement amid Washington’s reinstated sanctions. Other JCPOA signatories have so far failed to ensure Tehran's economic interests in the face of unilateral US sanctions.",

    "description": "SEOUL (Sputnik) - The US State Department's designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism in its annual report is a serious provocation, the country's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",
    "articleText": "North Korea was named among the countries that continued to sponsor terrorist activities as written in the Country Report on Terrorism 2018. Korean Central News Agency said, citing the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, that the United States was still pursuing a hostile policy towards North Korea. The ministry condemned the report, saying it was full of all sorts of lies and fabrications, and is a serious political provocation, according to the media outlet. The spokesman added that Pyongyang was against any manifestations of terrorism or support for it. According to the State Department’s 2018 report, North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1988, mainly because of its participation in the bombing of a Korean Air flight in 1987. The country was removed from the list in 2008, but brought back in 2017 after the United States determined that, since 2008, North Korea had repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism. North Korea has been engaged in denuclearization talks with the United States since 2018. The country's leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump expressed their commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula during talks in Singapore last June. However recent negotiations between the two leaders in Vietnam collapsed due to disagreements over the timing of sanctions relief. Choe Ryong Hae, the president of the Presidium of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly said in October that Pyongyang is ready to discuss the denuclearization process with Washington after the latter renounces its hostile stance on North Korea.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US President Donald Trump spoke to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi to express support for reaching a deal over the disputed Nile dam project, White House spokesperson Judd Deere said in a statement.",
    "articleText": "The Trump administration offered to host talks on 6 November between officials from Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia to settle the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). \"Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of Egypt. President Trump expressed support for Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan’s ongoing negotiations to reach a collaborative agreement on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam\", Deere said on Monday. Earlier, Sisi expressed confidence that the talks under the auspices of the United States would lead to success in finding solutions to the disputed dam. Since 2012, Ethiopia has been building what would become Africa's largest hydroelectric power plant when completed. Experts believe that when the GERD is launched, it will inevitably lead to water shortages in downstream-located Sudan and Egypt. The three states have held over a dozen talks since the start of the construction but the disagreements persist. The controversy spiked earlier this year after media misquoted Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as declaring his country's readiness to wage war, if needed, to defend its right for the GERD construction. On 24 October, Sisi and Ethiopia's Ahmed agreed to resume negotiations, in particular by resuming \"the operation of the independent technical negotiating commission in a more open and positive format.\" The agreement was reached at the Russia-Africa Summit and Economic Forum in Sochi.",

The Bidens claim that Trump’s accusations are false. Last week, Trump said that he wanted to read the transcript of his telephone conversation with Zelensky out loud and in public. The White House declassified what is claimed to be an unredacted transcript of the now-notorious phone call.

    "title": "Mexican Authorities to Auction Six Houses Seized From Druglord El Chapo - Report",
    "description": "The Mexican Administration of Property and Disposal Service [SAE] - which initiated the auction - estimates the value of six real estate properties located in Culiacan, Sinaloa, at about Mex$19,430,000 or some $1,000,000.",
    "articleText": "The most remarkable property is a modest-looking, single-story house said to be worth about $127,287, The Daily Mail broke the news on Monday. The house has, however, the most gripping history among other properties of notorious drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman, also notoriously known as El Chapo ('Shortie'). The media report said that Mexican law enforcement agencies stormed the steel-armored doors of this building on 17 February 2004 in hopes of apprehending the violent drug lord. El Chapo, however, escaped through a tunnel hidden underneath a bathtub before he was finally captured a week later. That military operation reportedly led Mexican authorities to the notorious discovery of a complex tunnel system beneath the compound connecting all six houses. The most expensive lot, however, valued at Mex$11,224,445, or $587,000, was previously purchased by El Chapo for Griselda López, the mother of his son, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, who is wanted by the US, The Daily Mail said. The luxurious three-story house has multiple bedrooms and an outdoor backyard swimming pool. According to the UK-based media report, an attempt to capture Guzman Lopez in October was fumbled by the Mexican government in an operation that saw at least 13 people killed. All six houses are fully furnished with working TV sets, washing and drying machines, microwaves and exercise equipment used by El Chapo. Mexican authorities reportedly hope to give all earnings from the auction sale - scheduled later this week - to local needy children in the southwestern state of Oaxaca, The Daily Mail said. El Chapo faced several court trials but repeatedly escaped justice. He was captured in 2016 and extradited to the United States in 2017. In July, a US federal judge sentenced him to life in prison plus 30 years on various charges related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel.",

The DoJ letter reportedly warns that the author may be subject to a breach in their nondisclosure agreements. \"If the author is, in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump administration, publication of the book may violate that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements, including nondisclosure agreements that are routinely required with respect to information obtained in the course of one's official responsibilities or as a condition for access to classified information,\" wrote Joseph Hunt, assistant attorney general, quoted by Fox News.

    "description": "Bureau agents communicated with the would-be attacker for a month before providing him with fake explosives and subsequently arresting him, court documents record.",
    "articleText": "The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) says it successfully thwarted a bombing attack on a local synagogue in Pueblo, not far from Denver, Colorado. Agents posed as co-conspirators for a 27-year old man who made no secret of his anti-Semitic views, and arrested him after delivering bombs for an attack, CBS News reported citing court papers. According to the report, the FBI identified Richard Holzer after someone tipped them about comments he made on social media. Upon analyzing the comments, the agency determined that the man posed a threat to the Jewish community. Agents posing as anti-Semitism supporters contacted Holzer who then reportedly sent audio and video files to a female agent clarifying the suspect’s hatred for Jews and his intention to cause violence. Here is the mugshot for Richard Holzer, arrested in plot to blow up Temple Emanuel in Pueblo. pic.twitter.com/GQEk8SBtLT — EPCSheriff (@EPCSheriff) November 4, 2019 Two weeks later, three agents met Holzer at a restaurant in which they discussed a possible attack on a local synagogue, during which Holzer opined that Molotov cocktails would “not be enough.” It was during this conversation that agents suggested providing him with pipe bombs. Approximately one month later, the company met again. Holzer showed up at a motel “wearing a Nazi armband and carrying a backpack with a knife, a mask, and a copy of [Adolf Hitler’s] ‘Mein Kampf’,” the report says. An undercover agent showed Holzer two pipe bombs and two bundles of dynamite. The FBI noted that the ‘explosives’ were inert fabrications. The suspect said he would conduct the attack in the middle of the night. The agents then arrested the man, who admitted to the plot and agreed to speak with federal investigators. On Monday, Holzer made his first court appearance, charged with one count of attempting to obstruct religious exercise by force using explosives and fire, a federal hate crime. Officials describe the charges as “domestic terrorism,” a CBS New report says. Pueblo’s Temple Emanuel is the second-oldest synagogue in Colorado, completed in 1900, according to the religious facility’s website. The oldest Colorado synagogue, also named Temple Emanuel, was established in 1874 in nearby Denver.",

    "description": "New findings appear to support the hypothesis of a ‘closed universe’ which bears some unconventional space-time implications, although the majority of science does not currently support this model.",
    "articleText": "A new study published Monday in the Nature Astronomy journal appears to support the hypothesis that our universe is curved and not flat, as a majority of science believes. If this is the case, then traveling in one direction will eventually bring you back to the point where you began, what scientists call a ‘closed universe’. However, most scientists currently support the theory of the ‘flat universe’ which suggests that the known universe expands in all directions and travelling in one direction will either bring you to the end of the universe or to infinity (there are different hypotheses). Earlier results from the Planck spacecraft mission appear to support the flat universe theory. The study, entitled “Planck evidence for a closed Universe and a possible crisis for cosmology” deals with the ‘cosmic microwave background’ (CMB), the electromagnetic signature of the Big Bang that gave birth to our universe at the beginning. According to the study, authored by a team of researchers from the UK and Italy, the CMB reveals significantly more ‘gravitational lensing’ than was expected, suggesting that gravity is bending the microwaves much more than today’s physics can explain. “The assumption of a flat Universe could […] mask a cosmological crisis where disparate observed properties of the Universe appear to be mutually inconsistent,” the study introduction observes. The scientists who wrote the report, however, retain a dose of healthy skepticism regarding their own findings. \"I don't want to say that I believe in a closed universe,\" study co-author Alessandro Melchiorri of Sapienza University in Rome told Live Science. \"I'm a little bit more neutral. I'd say, let's wait on the data and what the new data will say. What I believe is that there's a discrepancy now, that we have to be careful and try to find what is producing this discrepancy.\" Earlier measurements conducted by the Planck spacecraft suggested that the Universe was flat, with what has been claimed to be 99.8 percent accuracy. Researchers note, however, that “future measurements are needed to clarify whether the observed discordances are due to undetected systematics, or to new physics or simply are a statistical fluctuation.”",

    "articleText": "\"We will do this on 14 January. We are going to completely break off relations with Venezuela\", the president told reporters, cited by the Impulso newspaper. Giammattei beat his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres, in the second round of the election on 11 August, after an inconclusive first round in June. He won 57 percent of the vote. The situation in Venezuela has been tense since January, when anti-government protests, fueled by opposition leader Juan Guaido’s move to proclaim himself the country’s interim president, erupted. The confrontation between the Venezuelan opposition, led by Juan Guaido, and the government of constitutionally-elected Venezuelan President Maduro resulted in a full-scale political crisis in the country. Maduro has slammed Guaido, saying he acted at the orders of the United States, which sought to install him as the country’s president and get hold of Venezuela’s oil assets. In May, the Venezuelan authorities thwarted a coup attempt involving the military. Guaido was swiftly recognized by the United States and its allies, including those in Europe, while Russia and China among numerous other countries have backed the elected government and Nicolas Maduro.",

    "description": "UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) - Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused the United States of exerting pressure on Latin American countries to oppose the United Nations draft resolution against the US-imposed economic blockade on Cuba.",
    "articleText": "\"The US authorities have been carrying out different actions of pressures and blackmail to erode the voting pattern in support to the draft resolution that Cuba has been presenting to the United Nations General Assembly which calls for an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade against my country\", Rodriguez said on Monday. \"These pressures have been particularly targeted against the Latin American countries\". Rodriguez also said that US embassies in six countries in the region applied intense pressure on governments to vote against the draft resolution. \"The crude way in which President [Donald] Trump’s administration resorts to a whole range of preconditions and blackmail to meet its foreign policy goals is only well too known\", Rodriguez said. Cuba counts on the support of Latin American countries and expects that the governments will not find themselves swayed by US pressure, Rodriguez added. Rodriguez noted last month the US Department of State summoned representatives from four Latin American countries to persuade them to vote against the draft resolution. The United States first imposed an arms embargo on Cuba in 1958. The embargo was complemented by the introduction of restrictions in various other sectors, including sanctions on financial transactions, trade and travel. Former US President Barack Obama relaxed US policy toward Cuba, introducing regulations to ease people-to-people contacts. However, Trump toughened the policy once he came to power in 2016, restricting travel, boosting the economic embargo and imposing sanctions on Raul Castro, Cuba's Communist Party leader, over alleged human rights violations and for supporting the Venezuelan leadership. Cuba’s envoy to Russia Gerardo Penalver Portal said the draft resolution would be presented at the United Nations on 6-7 November.",

    "description": "Violence, vandalism and bloodshed have consumed Hong Kong in the past few days as anti-government protests have entered their 22nd week. In examining the uptick in violence, however, it would appear that protesters’ numbers are declining at the same time.",
    "articleText": "The Hong Kong Police Force and its ranks of riot police were faced with a number of situations this weekend, ranging from roadblocks and arson to knife attacks and ear biting. The district councillor who loss his ear is not attacked by the knife it's attacked by the bite.l from the thug.#hongkong pic.twitter.com/TEk8qQubeb — Panda😷 (@DCheng36387164) November 3, 2019 The Hong Kong office of China’s Xinhua News Agency was also the site of vandalism as protesters graffitied its walls and busted its windows. Police have responded with crowd control equipment such as water cannons and tear gas, the latter of which has been harshly criticized by Western powers. John Ross, a senior fellow at Chongyang Institute, Renmin University of China, who recently returned from a trip to Hong Kong, joined Radio Sputnik’s Loud and Clear on Monday to discuss his experience in the city and give a look into how demonstrators look today compared to several months ago. https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/hong-kong-rioting-flares-over-the-weeken Ross told hosts Brian Becker and John Kiriakou that although he recently traveled to Hong Kong, he avoided particular areas of the semi-autonomous city. “I’m afraid that these people are very politically motivated and dangerous. They attack mainland Chinese people,” he contended, adding that they more than likely “would attack someone who disagrees with them,” such as himself. Ross also pushed back against reports that saying the Hong Kong Police Force is being too aggressive with demonstrators in recent months. “The idea that the Hong Kong Police have been brutal is absolutely ridiculous,” he asserted. “In the US, several people would be dead, and in a Latin American country the number of people who would be dead would certainly be measured in double figures.” Despite not setting foot within a “riot” area, Ross said he was still able to get a view of the current demonstrations and how they compared to the initial protests that were centered around the proposed extradition bill - which has now been formally withdrawn for several weeks. He explained that although protests were larger, less aggressive and more in line with China’s “one country, two systems” policy when they were mainly opposing the extradition legislation, demonstrations have now “been reduced to several thousand people engaged in very violent actions, and I think they’re getting isolated from the mass of the population.” “The really big protests came from the social inequality,” Ross argued, which could possibly have been lessened if mainland China played more of a role in Hong Kong’s government and acted as an intermediary between the “billionaires - who frankly run Hong Kong - and the mass of the population.” “But you have a hard core of several thousand, but extremely violent, demonstrators who are still active,” he said, arguing that, with less manpower to throw around, those riotous demonstrators have opted to increase their level of violence.

    "description": "Monday marks the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis, when 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days after students who supported the Iranian Revolution seized the American Embassy in Tehran, changing the course of US-Iran relations and American politics.",
    "articleText": "Gareth Porter, a historian, investigative journalist and the author of “Manufactured Crisis: The Untold Story of the Iran Nuclear Scare,” joined Radio Sputnik's Loud & Clear Monday to discuss how the corporate media’s coverage of the hostage crisis enormously influenced US public opinion toward Iran. https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/40-years-later-the-seizure-of-the-us-emb “It’s clear that a lot has happened in the meantime that involves more than simply remembering the hostage crisis. It’s very true that that event had enormous influence over public opinion in the US and that particularly the US national security state itself nursed a lot of sense of grievance toward Iran because of that, but it’s by far not the only or most important cause of the tension and real serious conflict between the US and Iran,” Porter told hosts John Kiriakou and Brian Becker, adding that a great deal has occurred since the hostage crisis to impact US-Iran relations. Porter told Sputnik the event created a “political atmosphere in the US that was hostile to the Islamic Republic, which was established in 1979, and that clearly made it more difficult for subsequent government administrations in the US to make decisions that would change the reality. And it made it easier for, I must say, Israel to intervene politically and exercise enormous influence over US policy toward Iran beginning with the Clinton administration. In that sense, it has clearly enabled a lot of changes in the wrong direction with regards to US policy toward Iran.” During the Iran hostage crisis, the students demanded that the US extradite the former US-backed Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown earlier that year during the revolution and had come to the US to receive cancer medical treatment. The US and Iran eventually signed an agreement to release the hostages in January 1981, after the US agreed to lift sanctions it had imposed in reaction to the hostage crisis - but not before a botched rescue attempt severely embarrassed President Jimmy Carter’s administration and stiffened Iranian hostility to Washington. “It’s impossible to say what the course of US-Iran relations would have been had the response in the US to that hostage-taking been relatively rational. But it wasn’t. In fact, what happened - and I think there is a whole history here that people really need to be familiar with, that is not known at all - the mass media, the corporate media in the US, particularly ABC, was responsible for creating nightly news coverage, but all the networks basically chimed in and made this a major news coverage cause that was aimed at increasing their audience. They recognized that this - like the war against [Former Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein’s regime in 1991 - was a way of increasing their listening and viewing audience, and so took advantage of it fully. And that had very serious consequences,” Porter explained. Most Americans, according to Porter, are not aware of the history of US-Iran relations, particularly the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 in a carefully orchestrated coup d'état by the US Central Intelligence Agency and its UK counterpart, MI6. The coup was triggered by the British government’s uneasiness over losing control of the Iranian oil industry after Mosaddegh severed all diplomatic ties with Britain in 1952. “The media and of course the US national security state, never allowed the American people to understand the underlying issues that were at stake in the earlier period of US-Iran relationships when the US overthrew the democratically-elected government of Mossadegh in 1953,” Porter noted. “That overthrow was a result of a decision by the Eisenhower administration to ally with the British colonists worldwide, because they understood that the British had done Iran wrong, and they knew the Iranians were quite justified in nationalizing oil. But they were unwilling to break the alliance with the British because they believed that they needed the British position in Southeast Asia and in the Middle East, where there were what they thought of as extremist nationalists who would be against US influence and power in those parts of the world.” “And so there was a fundamental decision made, and of course, that required that they continue to deceive the American public about what the issues really were,” Porter explained, noting that the US media became “part of the national security state’s apparatus for continuing to mislead the American public.” The US media frequently propagates false narratives that veil historical facts from the American public, he said. “You have layer upon layer of false narratives, particularly on Iran, of course, over decades now. It’s been 40 years on that this process has been going on, and it simply gets deepened as time goes by. And we are now so far under the influence of these false narratives that it’s very difficult for the American public to see the truth at all or push for the right policies because of those narratives,” Porter explained. In another move that deteriorated US-Iran relations, the US pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018, despite Tehran's continued compliance with the agreement by not pursuing a nuclear weapons program, as attested to by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The Obama administration basically gave the anti-JCPOA movement, if you will, its strongest card, which is that it did not contest the notion that Iran, of course, wants nuclear weapons and has secretly worked on nuclear weapons and therefore can't be trusted. And that is something that allows the people who are absolutely opposed to the JCPOA and want to have a military confrontation with Iran to have their way with public opinion in the US. That’s where we are, unfortunately,” Porter noted. The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

Earlier on Monday, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said that the United Nations had received an official notification by the United States outlining its intent to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement within a year. In 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement as soon as it is legally allowed to do so. The Paris Agreement, considered to be a landmark international deal on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions fomenting climate change, was signed in the French capital in 2015. The pact, created within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, aims to keep the increase in average global temperatures at below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Salehi also noted that the heavy water reserves in Iran at the moment are approximately 128 tonnes, that is, do not exceed the amount of 130 tonnes stipulated by the nuclear deal, even despite Tehran’s refusal to abide by its restrictions. Iran has buyers for its heavy water, Salehi said, adding that Tehran continues to sell it. Salehi said earlier that Iran will launch an auxiliary part of a heavy-water nuclear reactor in Arak within a short timeframe. One of the conditions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as Iran nuclear deal, for the Iranian nuclear program was that Iran would rebuild the modernized reactor in Arak for peaceful nuclear research and production of radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes. Tehran earlier announced the third stage of reducing the obligations under the nuclear deal, declaring its ability to restore the nuclear reactor in Arak as it was before the JCPOA was concluded in summer 2015. In May 2018, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew his country from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed economic sanctions on Tehran. Exactly a year later, Iran announced its own decision to partially suspend its JCPOA obligations and gave the other European signatories a deadline of 60 days to save the accord. As the first deadline expired, Iran said it would begin enriching uranium beyond the JCPOA-set 3.67-percent level, warning to gradually abandon its nuclear commitments every 60 days unless European signatories to the deal ensured Iran's interests under the agreement amid Washington’s reinstated sanctions.",

    "title": "Liz Cheney to Introduce Bill Barring White House From Renewing Iran Waivers - Report",
    "description": "Liz Cheney wants to plug a loophole that allows the Trump administration to issue waivers that allow foreign companies to cooperate with Iran on its nuclear facilities despite sanctions.",
    "articleText": "Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Dick Cheney, will introduce a bill that will forbid the Trump administration from extending nuclear waivers to Iran, The Hill reported Monday. According to current rules, the White House has the right to issue ‘civil nuclear’ waivers, allowing foreign companies to conduct non-proliferation work at Iranian nuclear facilities. Cheney’s bill will remove this option. \"These ‘civil nuclear' waivers legitimize Iran's illicit nuclear infrastructure and help sustain President Obama's disastrous nuclear deal,\" Cheney said to The Washington Free Beacon, adding that \"Congress is determined to support President Donald Trump's rightful exit from that deal and his successful maximum pressure campaign against Tehran.” “That is why I will soon be introducing legislation that revokes these exceptions and ensures that the nuclear deal is totally and completely dismantled,\" she said. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the so-called Iranian nuclear deal, signed by the US, Iran, Russia, China, the EU and several European nations. Cheney’s bill will be mirrored by additional legislation authored by Senators Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham, who called the waiver mechanism a “loophole,” according to The Hill. Earlier last week, Trump renewed waivers allowing foreign companies to cooperate with Iran on nuclear projects. Trump’s nuclear waivers received staunch criticism from “hawks” within Congress, including Cruz and Graham. \"This is disappointing and another lost opportunity to tear up the catastrophic Obama-Iran nuclear deal once and for all,\" the two senators said in a joint statement. “President Trump should immediately order his administration to stop issuing civil nuclear waivers.” Despite the lawmakers’ initiative, the waivers in question were already signed, The Hill reports, citing the US State Department. The department has defended the mechanism, saying it allows them to keep an eye on Iran’s nuclear development. \"This decision will help preserve oversight of Iran's civil nuclear program, reduce proliferation risks, constrain Iran's ability to shorten its ‘breakout time' to a nuclear weapon, and prevent the regime from reconstituting sites for proliferation-sensitive purposes,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in a statement last week.",

    "description": "On this episode of The Critical Hour, Dr. Wilmer Leon is joined by Dave Lindorff, investigative reporter and founder of the news collective This Can't Be Happening!",
    "articleText": "\"Russell Vought, a [White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick] Mulvaney protege who leads the White House Office of Management and Budget, intends a concerted defiance of congressional subpoenas in coming days, and two of his subordinates will follow suit — simultaneously proving their loyalty to the president and creating a potentially critical firewall regarding the alleged use of foreign aid to elicit political favors from a US ally,\" the Washington Post reported Sunday. This happens as House of Representatives impeachment investigators begin to take their work into the public eye: on Monday, the House released transcripts of private testimonies by former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and diplomat Michael McKinley, who advised Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And what’s really interesting to me is a federal appeals panel said on Monday that President Donald Trump’s accounting firm must turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors. The appeals court said the president’s accounting firm, not Trump himself, was subpoenaed for the documents, so it did not matter whether presidents have immunity. In Chile, there’s a revolt against neoliberalism that corporate American media is refusing to cover. Alan MacLeod writes in MintPress News: “'We are at war with a powerful, relentless enemy that respects nothing nor anyone' thundered Chilean President Sebastian Piñera during a speech to the nation, deliberately echoing the infamous catchphrase of fascist military dictator Augusto Pinochet. The 'enemy' he was referencing were Chilean citizens, more than 1 million of them taking to the streets Friday afternoon in a revolt against the neoliberal system Piñera was implementing against their will, demanding his resignation.\" In October 2018, when Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil after one of the most polarizing elections in the country's history, he called himself a \"defender of freedom\" and said his government would protect citizens who \"follow their duties and respect the laws.\" How are these neoliberal politicians taking hold and carrying the day? \"Hundreds gathered this weekend to mark the 40th anniversary of the Greensboro massacre, when 40 Ku Klux Klansmen and American Nazis opened fire on an anti-Klan demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, killing five anti-racist activists in a span of 88 seconds,\" Democracy Now! reported Monday. \"Those killed were members of the Communist Workers’ Party. Ten other activists were injured. No one was convicted in the massacre, but a jury did find the Greensboro police liable for cooperating with the Ku Klux Klan in a wrongful death. Local pastors in Greensboro are now calling on the City Council to issue an apology for the events that led to the 1979 killing.\" Many call this the massacre that spawned the alt-right. What was this, how are its repercussions being felt today, and why is this not getting more coverage?

    "description": "China is exerting pressure on the Trump administration to remove tariffs Washington imposed in September and tariffs scheduled to go in effect in mid-December, before Beijing commits to the so-called Phase One of the bilateral trade deal, the US-based media reported earlier on Monday.",
    "articleText": "In particular, Beijing demands that Washington remove the 15-percent tariff the Trump administration imposed in September on $112 billion of Chinese goods. According to the Financial Times, the Trump administration is considering a rollback on certain levies - including clothing, appliances, and flatscreen monitors - as a concession to seal a partial deal that would reportedly pause the trade war with Beijing as early as this month. China reportedly seeks the tariffs’ removal in exchange for agreeing to purchase up to $50 billion worth of US agricultural goods, commit to open up its financial services sector to United States firms and increase intellectual property protections. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the United States may withdraw its decision to impose tariffs in December if Phase One goes well. On 13 October, US President Donald Trump announced that he had agreed in principle to Phase One of a trade deal with China’s Vice Premier Liu after high-level bilateral talks in DC Trump said the deal includes China agreeing to purchase up to $50 billion in US agricultural goods in addition to making reforms concerning intellectual property and financial services. The trade row between the world’s two largest economies erupted in June 2018 when the United States imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese exports, prompting Beijing to respond in kind. Since then, the two countries have been engaged in a trade war, but have also started negotiations to resolve their trade-related differences.",

    "description": "A Chicago-area sports bar has fired at least two employees who held management positions after a group of customers said they were instructed to change tables because a regular customer “didn’t want black people sitting near him.”",
    "articleText": "Restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings is receiving backlash after its Naperville, Illinois, location went viral for accommodating the requests of a “racist” restaurant regular, as the server described the man. Mary Vahl, a black woman, explained in an October 27 Facebook post that things took a left turn the moment the previous night that her 18-person party of varying ethnicities walked into the sports bar last month. Vahl recounted that before they could all get settled in their seats, the restaurant’s host first inquired, “What race are you guys?” When asked why it mattered, the host informed Vahl’s husband, Justin, that he could not seat them in a certain section because a regular customer “doesn’t want black people sitting near him.” Vahl said that another employee serving the upset “regular” approached her party and claimed the tables they were using were reserved for someone else. However, when a reporter with the local outlet Naperville Sun called to make a reservation, the Buffalo Wild Wings location in question told them that they do not take reservations. The service manager, identified in Vahl’s post only as Hannah, also attempted to use the \"reserved\" excuse. “It’s apparent that this staff knows these two individuals as they were playful with conversation and took their time to make our experience difficult,” Vahl said in her Facebook post. “If you don’t want to sit next to certain people in a public restaurant then you should probably eat dinner in the comfort of your own home.” “A moment to hangout with a group of friends after a birthday party, turned into a discussion with our young impressionable sons about how we didn’t get kicked out, but willingly CHOSE to leave because of the unfair treatment we were being given,” she concluded. After leaving the restaurant, Vahl and her party were able to enjoy a meal at a nearby Hooters sports bar. \"We take this incident very seriously and after conducting a thorough, internal investigation have terminated the employees involved. Buffalo Wild Wings values an inclusive environment and has zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind,” the company said in a statement to ABC7. Hannah and another manager were among those fired. From a local perspective, Naperville Mayor Steve Chirico told the outlet that the incident was “unacceptable” and that the restaurant’s staff should undergo training to understand “how to treat people properly.” \"I think that it would be naive to think that it does not happen,\" Chirico said, speaking of the customer’s complaints about Vahl’s party. \"We know that people are out there with racist views, and it is unfortunate.\"",

    "articleText": "As rallies grew violent, authorities claims that they must declare a curfew and cut internet access in Baghdad and five other regions. According to data from the NetBlocks internet observatory, online \"access has been cut across much of Iraq by internet providers as of 21:00 UTC, Monday 4 November 2019 (00:00 Baghdad time 5 November 2019)\".

At the same time, Mahdi warned that the government's resignation would throw the country into further chaos. Authorities have previously conducted a reshuffle in security bodies in provinces where protests initially broke out. Dozens of protesters were injured as a result of violent clashes with security forces in Baghdad near the area where Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's office is located, witnesses said on Monday.

    "articleText": "Today is the 40th anniversary of the Iran Hostage Crisis, where Iranian students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 embassy officers hostage. That standoff lasted 444 days, and it permanently changed the scope of both US-Iran relations and American politics. And yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the Greensboro Massacre, where Ku Klux Klansmen, led by an FBI agent and an ATF agent, opened fire on a group of American communists in Greensboro, North Carolina, killing five. Nobody was ever brought to justice for the attack. Even as House Democrats on Thursday ratified an impeachment resolution against President Trump, a federal judge has slowed the pace of the inquiry by declining to rule on whether a key witness needed to testify before the House of Representatives. Instead, he gave all relevant parties several weeks to prepare their arguments. That means the hearings will likely last through the Christmas holidays. And how will all of this affect the 2020 election? Dan Kovalik, a human rights and labor lawyer who is the author of the book “The Plot to Overthrow Venezuela: How the US is Orchestrating a Coup for Oil.”, joins the show. Rioting continued over the weekend in Hong Kong, with demonstrators attacking Xinhua, the Chinese state news service. Xinhua then called on authorities to take a tougher line with demonstrators. Meanwhile, protestors are calling on the US to help them. Brian and John speak with John Ross, Senior Fellow at Chongyang Institute, Renmin University of China, and an award-winning resident columnist with several Chinese media organizations. Two activists with the organization Veterans for Peace are trapped in Ireland, unable to return home due to criminal charges pending against them for engaging in an anti-war protest. A renewed effort is underway to win their freedom. Gerry Condon, national president of Veterans for Peace, joins the show. The hosts take a look at the big stories to watch in the week ahead. Walter Smolarek, Sputnik News analyst and producer, joins Brian and John.

    "articleText": "With both the Conservatives and Labour having pledged to significantly increase the funds available for various social programmes thus far. But will said levels of spending; actually be possible without severely increasing taxes and damaging business? Or is this merely an example of two sides vying for vital political capital? Journalist David Lindsay shares the views on the matter. Sputnik: Could pledges for further investment in public services made by both the Conservative and Labour Parties realistically be carried out? David Lindsay: It can be done. A sovereign state with its own free floating currency has as much of that free flowing currency as it chooses to issue to itself. The election will result in a hung parliament, beyond that I will predict absolutely nothing, that’s become a fools game now, but there is going to be another hung parliament, I’ve no idea who’s going to be the largest party; it would be either the Conservatives or Labour, but I’ve got no idea which one. Sputnik: Could a second Brexit referendum be on the cards now that Article Fifty has been postponed until January 2020? David Lindsay: A second referendum is now really very likely because the extension period has now gone into 2020, and if that happened, as it now has; there was always a very high chance of a second referendum taking place. Sputnik: What would the British public’s reaction be if a second Brexit referendum was held and the UK’s departure from the EU was ultimately cancelled? David Lindsay: There would be great anger among many of the leave voters, but it’s very difficult to say what anyone could really do about it, and it would leave a scar that would last for the rest of many people’s lives, it would be definitive of British political activity for as long as I was left alive.

The official called the arrest an “intelligence gold mine,” the report says. According to the report, the 65-year old woman, named Rasmiya Awad, was captured in a raid conducted Monday. Awad was living in a trailer near the town of Azaz, north of Aleppo, a region under Turkish control since 2016 Operation Euphrates Shield. \"This kind of thing is an intelligence gold mine. What she knows about [Daesh*] can significantly expand our understanding of the group and help us catch more bad guys,\" the official said, according to AP.

Rasmiya is suspected to be affiliated with the Daesh terror group, the official said, without providing further detail. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whose real name was Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri (according to The Daily Telegraph), was an Iraqi from the town of Samarra, north of Baghdad.

    "articleText": "According to Lev Parnas' lawyer Joseph Bondy, cited by Reuters, Parnas, the indicted associate of President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, is willing to work with the Trump impeachment inquiry. “We will honor and not avoid the committee’s requests to the extent they are legally proper, while scrupulously protecting Mr Parnas’ privileges including that of the Fifth Amendment”, Bondy said, referring to his client’s constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination, according to Reuters. Parnas and Fruman made their initial appearance at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on 10 October. Later that day, the two men were released on a $1 million bond each. Fruman and Parnas allegedly acted as associates to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and are accused of helping Giuliani investigate the business activities of former US Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Fruman and Parnas are also accused of having donated money to a member of Congress and then pressing the lawmaker to remove or recall the then-US ambassador to Ukraine. In September, US House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump abused his executive power by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a 25 July phone call to investigate the possibility of corrupt activities by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was linked to Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The Bidens have said Trump’s allegations were false. Last week, Trump said that he wanted to read out loud the transcript of his telephone conversation with Zelensky. The White House has, however, declassified a purportedly unredacted transcript of the now-notorious phone call. According to Reuters, Parnas will be a crucial witness if he cooperates. The Ukrainian-American businessman reportedly claimed to be a key player in connecting Trump's lawyer to Ukrainian officials during Giuliani’s inquiries into the activities of Biden and his son Hunter.",

    "description": "While residents of north-central India suffer from hazardous levels of smog, the government appears more concerned with the state of the Taj Mahal, as evidenced by its quick deployment of an air purifier van at the historic building this week.",
    "articleText": "“Looking at the developing situation and consistent deterioration in air quality, a mobile air purifier van has been deployed at the west gate of the Taj Mahal,” Regional Officer of India’s Pollution Control Board Bhuvan Yadav is quoted as saying this week about the famous mausoleum in Agra, the Times of India reported. Pollution levels are so high in India’s capital of New Delhi that the city government has banned around half of the city’s private cars from the roads. In addition, classes have been canceled at New Delhi schools, and authorities have declared a public emergency. \"I have a headache every day I wake up. It's suffocating to breathe sometimes. And inflammation in the nostrils and all. And eyes also. Like it kind of burns,\" local Ankusha Kushi told AFP. The pollution levels are currently so severe that breathing in the New Delhi air is equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes a day, Al Jazeera reported. On Monday morning, the particulate level in New Delhi’s atmosphere was 613 micrograms per cubic meter of air, Al Jazeera reported. Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, consists of microscopic solids and liquid droplets in the air that small enough to be inhaled and even absorbed by the bloodstream, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO’s recommended daily limit for PM2.5 concentration is 25 micrograms per cubic meter, and the annual limit is 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Fine particulate matter that travels into the respiratory tract can eventually affect lung health and aggravate conditions like asthma and heart disease. In addition, PM2.5 exposure has been linked to chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and cardiovascular illnesses. Smog levels were so impairing Monday that 30 flights were diverted from Delhi’s airport due to visibility issues, Al Jazeera reported. According to Al Jazeera’s New Delhi correspondent Anchal Vohra, pollution levels are especially high at this time of year due to farmers burning detritus leftover from the harvest in order to strip their fields. \"A huge part of the pollution is vehicular pollution, so if you halt the number of vehicles, then yes I believe it should help … But the large part of this pollution is because of farmers burning the stubble in neighbouring states which are also fighting pollution, but there is no political consensus ... no clear directions as to what the government plan is. [So] as long as farmers keep burning the stubble, and in winter the pollution is expected to be high,\" Vohra said. Government officials have urged locals to wear anti-pollution masks and avoid outdoor or physical activities.",

    "title": "Ex-Malaysian King Complains of 'Evil' Russian Wife, Denies 5-Month-Old is His Son - Report",
    "description": "The former ruler of Malaysia insists his ex-wife wants to use their failed marriage to gain fame and celebrity status and is publicly blasting her for making their marriage public without his consent. The former king denies that he abdicated the throne because of the marriage scandal.",
    "articleText": "Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan, the head of Malaysia’s Kelantan sultanate and former King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) of Malaysia has rebuked claims made by his former wife, Russian-born Oksana Voevodina, whom he married and later parted with last year that he fathered her son, the Daily Mail reported Monday. In a harsh statement delivered by a palace source who spoke to the Daily Mail, the sultan said photos of Voevodina’s 5-month-old son do not prove that he is the father of the baby and the infant could be “the son of any Asian man\". The Sultan “does not feel (the baby) looks like him\", a palace source told the Daily Mail, adding that the sultan says her claims that the baby was planned and that he cried with happiness upon discovering she was pregnant are “absolute nonsense\". #IsmailLeon #malaysian #russian #malaysianroyalty #kelantanese #sultanmuhammadV #petra#oksanavoevodina pics from @rihanapetra pic.twitter.com/95o2CiZ2Ig — ɢաɛռ ʍanickaʍ🌞 (@bambola169) November 3, 2019 Marrying Voevodina was “the biggest mistake of his life\", the source suggested. “[The sultan] mentioned that he had never met a woman as evil and vindictive as Oksana and that she showed her true colours at her wedding reception in Russia where she invited him to attend, lying to him it was a small family affair\", the source said, according to the Daily Mail. According to the report, the king wanted to keep their wedding a secret, and the Moscow reception, which he said Oksana turned into what he described as a “showbiz event” took him by surprise. Voevodina released pictures and footage of the reception to the press, revealing to the world and conservative Malaysians that the king had married a Russian beauty queen – a fact the king would have preferred not be known, the source said. “[The sultan] said she’s trying to make the best out of the situation using his royal status and using his last name to gain a celebrity status which she obviously desired since she entered the tacky reality show and Miss Moscow 2015\", the source said, declaring that “[Voevodina] has no dignity” after footage of her allegedly “having sex” in a swimming pool on a TV reality show some six years ago emerged earlier this year. In his public message to Voevodina, the sultan said “she should stop making a fool out of herself and move on as well and find herself a new husband\". “This marriage was a huge mistake in his personal life that should have never happened, but he said this was a lesson he had learned\", the source said, adding that the sultan now plans to have “an heir and children with a woman he loves\". In June 2018, the two married in a secret Islamic ceremony in Kelantan. In November, the two had a wedding reception in Moscow, by which time Voevodina was already pregnant with a son who was born in May 2019, according to the Daily Mail. And here are the happy couple. According to online reports his 25-year-old wife is a former beauty queen, Oksana Voevodina, who held the title of Miss Moscow in 2015. What could possibly go wrong? 🤷♂️ pic.twitter.com/FYFBqxwXh6 — pjm1kbw (@pjm1kbw) January 6, 2019 Just one month after the wedding reception, the two parted ways. In January, Muhammad abdicated the Malaysian throne – an elected position of constitutional monarch, in which he had served since 2016. The reason behind the move, a first in Malaysian history, has not yet been revealed. The palace source strongly denied the abdication occurred because the King’s marriage was made public, the Daily Mail report remarks. On June 2019, Muhammad officially divorced his wife, reportedly using the harshest Islamic ceremony, the report says. Muhammad will retain his title as the Sultan of Kelantan and now “wants to focus on working hard and helping people in his state to continue his father's legacy and creating his own happy family\", the source told the Daily Mail.",

    "title": "Ex-RBI Governor Uncertain of Finance Ministry's Bullish Predictions for Economic Recovery ",
    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): After a domestic growth shocker of 5 percent in the first quarter (April-June) of fiscal 2020, top Indian Finance Ministry officials expect Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth to recover in the second half of the current financial year.",
    "articleText": "The Indian government expects second quarter GDP numbers scheduled to be released on 29 November to remain muted. The ministry of finance has also said it is committed to the fiscal glide path. \"Growth is likely to recover in the second half of this financial year,” a top official from the Department of Economic Affairs in India's finance ministry revealed, adding: “We are following the glide path on fiscal deficit and will continue to do that.\" The official hinted further measures to boost the economy would also be taken as and when needed. In response to the slowest first-quarter growth since 2013, India has initiated a series of measures including a corporate tax rate cut, relief to the real estate sector and relief for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) from a tax surcharge. Economists and experts are, however, cautious about the impact of the measures and feel it is the demand side which needs to be adjusted to address economic woes. “We have revised the second half GDP projections for the Indian economy to 6.9 percent from 7.4 percent earlier. The full-year GDP projections have been revised downwards to 6.1 percent,” said economist Sunil Sinha, director, Public Finance, India Ratings. Stating that measures announced by the government will have an impact in the medium to long-term, the economist said these measures do not address demand side woes in the Indian economy. With a corporate tax cut, profitability in the balance sheet has increased, Sinha said, “but there are no plans on investment”. “On the other hand, individual incomes are not rising, rural economy is not picking up and incremental demand is not being created. One has to address the demand side and put more money in the pockets of the people,” Sinha noted. Bimal Jalan, a former governor of New Delhi's Reserve Bank of India, struck a cautionary tone: “Policy measures announced by the government are good. The moves will work. It is, however, difficult to say when exactly will the impact be felt.” According to Jalan, markets must wait for the outcome of the policy measures. “It is difficult to predict when will the Indian economy recover, but hopefully it will recover”. Jalan, who recently chaired the Expert Committee to Review the Extant Economic Capital Framework said that a number of factors such as a global slowdown, a trade war and credit demands have contributed to the slowdown. The committee was constituted by the Reserve Bank of India to review the workings of the central bank.",

    "description": "The so-called Phase One interim trade deal, which both countries are expected to sign, was announced by US President Donald Trump in October following high-level US-Chinese negotiations in Washington.",
    "articleText": "Beijing is pressing the Trump administration to cancel the next round of trade duties, scheduled for December, including the earlier round of trade penalties imposed in September ahead of the possible visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to the United States, Politico reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter. According to the media report, China is engaged in a \"full-court press\" for the removal of the tariffs in exchange for agreeing to buy up to $50 billion worth of US farm goods within two years and implement commitments to open its financial services sector and increase intellectual property protections. Beijing is also reportedly expecting a 25 percent of tariff to be removed - or at least cut in half - on an additional $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, although that is not anticipated to be part of a Phase One deal right now, Politico said, citing sources. Trump told reporters that Phase One of the US-China trade agreement could be signed in Iowa. According to US-based media reports, Iowa, a major farm state, has been hit by China's retaliatory agriculture-based economic penalties. Trump and Xi were initially to sign the Phase One agreement during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Chile in mid-November, but the event was canceled after civil unrest broke out in the country. Phase One of the trade negotiations is reportedly supposed to resolve issues concerning intellectual property, financial service and US agricultural exports. Trump said China agreed to purchase $40 to $50 billion of US farm goods under the trade deal. The Phase One agreement could ease the US-China trade war, prompting economists to note that the trade confrontation is on track to result in a global recession.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Kathmandu's as-yet-unratified agreement with Beijing will allow the mountainous country to shift it's economic focus away from India and toward China.",
    "articleText": "Over two-and-a-half years after signing an Agreement on Transit and Transportation and following it up this year with an upgraded protocol, Kathmandu says it is still waiting for Beijing to allow Nepali business to do third-party trading via its sea and land ports. Nepal will have access to four Chinese seaports; Tianjin, Shenzhen, Lianyungang and Zhanjiang, and three land ports; Lanzhou, Lhasa and Shigatse, once the 2016 Transit and Transportation Agreement is formalised. Kathmandu says it is ready to implement the deal, but Beijing must also ratify it, Nepal daily Kathmandu Post quoted an official source as saying. An upgraded protocol to the agreement was signed in April this year, but there is a clause that says Kathmandu and Beijing must inform each other about domestic laws in place for the pact to come into practice. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Kathmandu on 12 and 13 October was was thought to see the formalisation of the the agreement, but the event did not occur. Article 15 of the protocol says it can only come into effect a month after both sides notify each other officially. “Diplomatic correspondence is often delayed,” a senior Nepal government official said. In Beijing, a senior Nepal Embassy official told the Kathmandu Post that he was hoping to soon receive a Chinese response. Officials involved in negotiations said the implementation of the agreement and its protocols are behind schedule and Nepali importers are being inconvenienced. There is a feeling among them, according to reports, that the Chinese are not interested enough to see the agreement become law. The signing of the Transit and Transportation Agreement in 2016, during the visit of Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has been described as a “watershed moment” in Nepal’s diplomatic history, one that would end Nepal’s long-standing dependence on India for third-country trade. After the agreement’s upgraded protocols were signed during Nepalese President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s visit to China in April, both countries said the treaty would come into effect once they informed each other about their internal laws and regulations in place to allow transit and transportation. Nepal is awafre, according to reports, that it must improve its surface transport and dry port infrastructure to implement the deal. Currently, Nepali transport containers are only allowed to travel up to Kerung, a village on the Nepal-China border, but once the upgraded bilateral transportation agreement is formalised, imported goods can be transported up to the Tibetan city of Xigaste (a.k.a. Shigatse), by train and Nepali containers will transport them from Xigaste to the Nepali border.",

    "description": "As every East Coast aircraft carrier remains docked and maintenance deadlines pass by, the US Navy recently confirmed they have been exhausting all options and even called upon Carnival Cruise Line for repair advice and tips.",
    "articleText": "It was revealed last week that all six aircraft carriers based on the US’ East Coast were docked in Virginia at Naval Station Norfolk, for everything ranging from refuelings and repairs to full-blown overhauls. One West Coast aircraft carrier is also drydocked. In an effort to remedy the present situation and prevent a future pileup of carriers, the US Navy has branched out and tapped into new sources of naval knowledge. Speaking to Business Insider, Naval Sea Systems Command chief Vice Adm. Tom Moore revealed his branch met with numerous experts and executives of Carnival Cruise Line \"a few months back,\" reported Task & Purpose. A spokesman for the cruise line later backed up Moore’s statement and told the outlet that they spoke about how the cruise line has “been able to do shipyard maintenance as quickly and effectively” as they do. Though the idea of Carnival Cruise Line, which carries the largest amount of vacationers annually, partnering up with the Navy sounds odd, Cmdr. Sarah Higgins, the spokesperson for Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, said the military official \"believes the Department of the Navy must make every effort to retain and expand our competitive edge.\" In fact, Carnival Cruise Line is not the only company tapped by the Navy. Higgins noted Spencer has “met or spoken with companies from diverse sectors offering differing perspectives on sustainment, maintenance, supply-chain management, personnel management, and other topics.” Last month, Spencer, who once put his job on the line for the still-behind-schedule USS Ford, had a lot to say about lawmakers such as Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA) - a harsh critic and US Navy veteran who has taken the branch to task several times in recent months and recently said she does not see an \"end in sight” for the USS Ford’s maintenance. “Leaders in Congress who make disparaging comments against a platform [for which] we’re developing new technologies – you could not ask for a better disinformation program for our competitors,” he said on October 23 at the Brookings Institute, as reported by Breaking Defense. “And I truly mean that.” The USS Carl Vinson, the aircraft carrier receiving repairs on the West Coast, made headlines last month after Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) agents determined a third-class petty officer shot himself earlier this year after showing off in a “joking fashion.” Kitsap Sun reported witnesses told NCIS that the sailor was known to play a “game” of sorts to “elicit a reaction from others” and would \"unholster his weapon, position it towards his mouth, and pull the trigger, while smiling.” However, this time in particular, the gun was loaded and discharged. Luckily the gunshot was not fatal and the officer received a reduction in rank and 30 days of “restriction.” The location of the gunshot wound on the sailor’s body remains unknown.",

    "description": "Members of an advisory board appointed by the US Department of Defense (DoD) recently proposed a set of ethical principles for artificial intelligence (AI) use during war at a Georgetown University conference.",
    "articleText": "The members of the Defense Innovation Board (DIB) conducted numerous studies and consulted many experts in the AI field before crafting their list of ethical principles. Under their proposed guidelines, the DIB suggests that AI use in warfare be equitable, traceable, reliable and governable. The DIB also noted that human beings should be responsible and “exercise appropriate levels of judgment” in the use of DoD AI systems. It is now up to the DoD to either accept, alter or outright reject the recommendations put forth by the DIB. “DoD should take deliberate steps to avoid unintended bias in the development and deployment of combat or noncombat AI systems that would inadvertently cause harm to persons,” one of the principles reads. The board members also urged the DoD to continue researching and developing AI systems, as they are still rapidly changing. \"The valuable insights from the DIB are the product of 15 months of outreach to commercial industry, the government, academia and the American public,\" said Air Force Lt. Gen. John N.T. Shanahan, director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), according to a Friday DoD statement. \"The DIB's recommendations will help enhance the DoD's commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards as outlined in the DoD AI Strategy, while embracing the US military's strong history of applying rigorous testing and fielding standards for technology innovations,” the statement adds. The DoD has been making strides in its use of AI through the JAIC. According to its website, the center’s mission is to “transform the DoD by accelerating the delivery and adoption of AI to achieve mission impact at scale.” However, the DoD’s moves to implement AI have been met with criticism from some quarters. In April 2018, more than 4,000 Google employees signed a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai, asking him to end the company’s involvement in an AI program run by the Pentagon. The program, established in April 2017 and dubbed Project Maven, involves developing AI software for analyzing drone footage collected by the DoD. After intense scrutiny, Google decided not to review its Project Maven project with the Pentagon, although it has since partnered with the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to work on the Next AI program, a noncombat use of the technology. In August, the DoD expressed concern about falling behind China in terms of AI technology, particularly given US tech giants’ reservations about working with the Pentagon. “If we do not find a way to strengthen the bonds between the United States government and industry and academia, then I would say we do have the real risk of not moving as fast as China when it comes to [AI],” Shanahan said during a press briefing. Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology has been collaborating with the University’s School of Foreign Service to advise policymakers on artificial intelligence and national security.",

    "description": "The United States on Monday sanctioned the general staff of the Iranian armed forces and nine people, including the son of the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
    "articleText": "The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday suggested that the new US sanctions against Tehran are useless, stressing that the unilateral measures reveal the helplessness and inability of the Trump administration to use diplomacy. \"As we have repeatedly stated before, such measures only show the plight and helplessness of this regime, which does not know how to use rational diplomacy mechanisms\", a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi, said, condemning the sanctions and noting their futility. The US Department of Treasury imposed the new restrictions against Iran on the 40th anniversary of the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants, as over fifty Americans were held hostage for 444 days. Relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorated after the Trump administration abruptly declared in 2018 its unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as Iran nuclear deal, and the resumption of sanctions against Iran. A year later, Tehran began a gradual abandonment of its commitments to the JCPOA which is currently in its third stage. Meanwhile, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said earlier that Iran had increased its uranium production by more than tenfold in the last two months. He made that announcement ahead of the fourth step of Iran terminating its commitments to the JCPOA, expected to be announced this week.",

    "description": "Media frenzy over Monsta X do not stop even for a day whole last week starting with the withdrawal of Wonho, and now the leader Shownu is involved in two scandals in just couple of days.",
    "articleText": "Starship Enternment announced on Monday that it will pursue legal action against those who posted and distributed on social media a set of photos, claiming to depict naked Shownu, the leader of the Monsta X K-Pop boy band. pic.twitter.com/Q65E8fATWM — STARSHIP Ent. (@STARSHIPent) November 4, 2019 Earlier, several nude pictures started circulating online causing a buzz among netizens, as those who spread it insisted that it was none other than Shownu. One photo shows an apparently drunk man with a can of beer visible in the foreground sleeping in a bed. In another, a naked man stands still and looks directly into the camera. While most fans can clearly see that the man on the photos has nothing in common with the Monsta X leader, some posters argued otherwise. Responding to the incident, the group's label immediately issued a statement denying that the man on the photos is Shownu, adding that it will cooperate with the police and will report those who spread the pictures. Starship says it will seek damages for violating personal rights and distributing pornographic content. This news comes hot on the heels of another scandal involving Shownu. Previous scandals Last week, fans were shocked by the news that band member Wonho left the group. This was preceded by a spate of scandals: words taken out of context that ignited the anger of the MeToo movement; and a scandal with the model Jung Da Eun, who stated that he borrowed money from her six years ago and has still has not returned it. She also claims that they smoked marijuana in 2013. Wonho decided to leave the group, according to an official statement from the agency. Literally on the same day, Jung Da Eun posted messages from a man who claimed that the leader of the group, Shownu, was dating his wife. The agency immediately made a statement saying that the singer had not been in contact with this woman for more than a month and he didn’t even has a clue that she was married. Due all the scandals Monsta X are through this week, fans are trying to support them with clearing the search of the member's name and furious about those who want to view the leaked photos.

    "description": "Images appeared in a popular Chinese military magazine recently offering the first look at the country’s upcoming air-launched ballistic missile, slung under the belly of an H-6N bomber. Observers noted its similarity to China’s Dong Feng-15 missile, as well as Russia’s Kinzhal.",
    "articleText": "The new edition of the magazine Modern Ships featured on its cover a drawing of Beijing’s H6-N bomber carrying what seems to be an air-launched ballistic missile underneath its belly. The images reportedly note only that the plane’s center-line pylon can be equipped with “large external objects,” but observers have noted the weapon’s incredibly similarity to the Dong Feng-15 ballistic missile already employed by China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). © Sputnik The cover of \"Modern Ships\" magazine featuring a Xian H-6N bomber carrying an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) Sputnik reported in May on China’s pursuit of the novel air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) after the Pentagon raised a warning about the weapon, fearing Beijing was closing in on a “viable nuclear triad.” Only a few countries have the capacity to ensure a nuclear response by land, air or sea, including the US, Russia and India. The only other ALBM currently in use is Russia’s hypersonic Kinzhal missile, which was introduced in 2017 is fired from a MiG-31 interceptor. The US and UK attempted to develop a viable ALBM in the Bold Orion project and GAM-87 Skybolt missile; while the program yielded the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile employed by the British Royal Navy as part of its sea-based nuclear deterrent for decades, the Pentagon abandoned the ALBM as intercontinental ballistic missiles became more a more viable alternative for a nuclear response. The Soviet Union, four years behind the US nuclear program, never considered the weapon, immediately developing ICBMs. © Sputnik An oblique image of China's Xian H-6N bomber carrying an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) in \"Modern Ships\" magazine When the new H-6N modification of China’s H-6K bomber appeared in September, observers quickly noted its bomb bay seemed to be removed in favor of an exterior hardpoint semi-conformed to the plane’s profile. Even if the images posted yesterday were for the first time showing the underside of the latest H-6N bomber, these now clearly show not only the deleted bomb bay but also the semiconformal attachment for the new ballistic anti-ship missile. (Images via Huitong's CMA-Blog) pic.twitter.com/QKPq79TqlF — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 23, 2019 Another potential use for the exterior attachment could be lifting a new supersonic drone spotted in the National Day parade on October 1, which seems to have a corresponding top attachment spot. Here is some rare footage of a US Air Force B-58 Hustler supersonic strategic bomber testing out an ALBM in the late 1950s: However, China’s nuclear arsenal developed along very different lines than those of the US and Soviet Union. China’s small bomber fleet was never a viable threat to the US or USSR, and so in the late 1970s Beijing’s nuclear deterrent fell on the PLARF’s shoulders, building dozens of ICBMs. China’s nuclear arsenal has never approached the numbers Moscow and Washington possess, either: the PLARF has just 90 ICBMs, and the US Defense Intelligence Agency estimates Beijing has just 290 nuclear warheads in total. The United States, by comparison, has a total of 6,185 nuclear weapons, according to the Federation of American Scientists, although more than half of them are not immediately ready for use. © Sputnik Drawings in \"Modern Ships\" magazine showing China's H-6N bomber, able to carry an external air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) In the Pentagon’s 2018 China Power Report, the Office of the Secretary of Defense noted the January 2018 testing of an ALBM known only as the CH-AS-X-13, judged to be a derivative of the Dong Feng-21 medium-range ballistic missile with its range increased to between 1,900 and 2,500 miles. Other modified versions of the DF-21 include an anti-ship ballistic missile, part of Beijing’s strategy of countering superior US naval power with more cost-effective “carrier-killer” anti-ship weaponry. However, this past May’s China Power Report noted a second ALBM could be in the works, with one being nuclear-armed and the other not, so it’s possible both the DF-15 and DF-21 are being modified for launch from an H-6N bomber. US Navy and Air Force officials recently highlighted their prioritization of developing anti-missile weaponry, especially in the form of lasers. Programs like HELIOS aim to develop defensive lasers powerful enough to burn through the vital parts of an incoming missile, shutting it down before it can strike its intended target. While the US has considerable anti-ballistic missile defense, Chinese and Russian development of hypersonic cruise missiles has reoriented their focus.",

    "title": "New Format for Discussing Kosovo at the UN Needed, Russia Could Act as Mediator - Pundit",
    "description": "Russia could take on the role of mediator in talks between Serbia and Kosovo, the deputy chairman of the Russian lower house's committee on international affairs, Alexey Chepa, said on Thursday.",
    "articleText": "\"If bilateral talks fail [to settle the problem], we need to engage a third party who will manage to skirt contentious issues. Russia could become a potential third party to the negotiations [between Serbia and Kosovo],\" Mr Chepa stressed. The negotiations between Serbia-Kosovo have been led by Brussels for eight years, but according to Dragana Trifkovic, head of the Belgrade-based Center for Geostrategic Studies, are unconstitutional, as the West is trying to impose a solution in violation of international law. \"The EU-led talks on resolving the Kosovo problem have produced no positive results and, in particular, no results that could contribute to a lasting peace between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija,\" Mrs Trifkovic said. \"The only regular international legal basis for resolving the Kosovo issue is the UNSCR (UN Security Council resolution) 1244,\" she explained. Resolution 1244, adopted in 1999, authorised an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo and established the United Nations Interim Administration Mission there (UNMIK) after the NATO war on Yugoslavia (1999). “For this reason, it is necessary to find a new format for discussing the Kosovo problem at the UN, where Russia would also act as a mediator. Russian representatives at the UN are making great efforts to understand and present the real situation in Kosovo and Metohia throughout the whole world,” Mrs. Trifkovic said. Srdja Trifkovic, a Serbian-American writer on international affairs and foreign affairs editor for Chronicles magazine believes that there are no preconditions for talks between Serbia and Kosovo, so no one should be mediating any negotiations. “[...] Even that phrase - Serbia and Kosovo - is wrong - because it presupposes that we are looking at two different entities. Serbia is effectively not in control of Kosovo, but Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia,” Mr Trifkovic noted. The authorities of the breakaway Serbian province wouldn’t want Moscow to play the role of a mediator because they know it doesn’t recognise its independence, the international relations expert said. \"The Albanians in Kosovo, or rather the temporary institutions that the Albanians proclaimed as an independent state in 2000, that they illegally and in violation of the Security Council Resolution 1244, that entity does not want Russia to interfere in any way - because they feel they are totally supported by both the European Union and the United States and that Russia is supportive of Serbia.\" The Role of the United States The United States Special Representative for the Western Balkans Matthew Palmer visited Kosovo last week reaffirming that finding a solution to the Kosovo-Serbia relationship is a “US strategic priority.” \"Resolving once and for all the relationship between Kosovo and Serbia through full normalisation remains a US strategic priority, one that will have an enormous impact on the people and the broader region,\" Palmer said in his speech in Pristina on Friday. Washington has intensified its efforts to restart stalled negotiations between the two Balkan rivals, with US President Donald Trump also appointing Ambassador Richard Grenell as Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Dialogue last month. But the US says it wants more than just a normalisation of dialogue, it also wants Kosovo and all of the Western Balkan nations to join NATO and the EU. However, some European countries, such as France, insist that the bloc is not ready to accept new members any time soon. © Sputnik / Dejan Simic The flags of America and Kosovo in Pristina Krenar Shala, a political analyst based in Kosovo, noted that the lack of unity among Euro-Atlantic members on the issue is only contributing to the already difficult situation. \"This disunity has created a climate of impasse,\" the political analyst explained. \"With this ambiguous situation in place, I believe that resolving the issue between Kosovo and Serbia will further deteriorate, albeit the ever-increasing pressure by the EU and the US to make the necessary compromise in order to solve it,\" Mr Shala said. He added that Brussels’ failure to make progress has led to Washington increasing its role in the Kosovo-Serbia issue. According to Dragana Trifkovic, the US wants to take over the initiative from the EU to resolve the Kosovo issue, so the time has now come for Russia to step in. Srdja Trifkovic, on the contrary, believes that the authorities of the breakaway Serbian province wouldn’t want Moscow to play the role of a mediator because it doesn’t recognise its independence, and the US will do everything they can to prevent Russia from taking part in these talks. “It is totally unimaginable that the United States would be willing to allow the Russian Federation to step in any negotiating capacity, considering the self-confidence and even arrogant way in which Washington sees itself as the only arbiter of Kosovo's future and where the European Union in Brussels is simply toeing the line,” he said. Nevertheless, Russia should still support Serbia in its refusal to be pressured into recognising Kosovo's independence, but without playing a mediating role, Mr Trifkovic argued. But at the same time, the US can’t be the only power imposing its own solutions, Dragana Trifkovic said, and Russia can be a stabilising factor for the Balkans. \"Especially when we consider the American role in the 1999 bombing of Serbia, which created the conditions for the realisation of the separatist plans of the Albanians,\" the head of the Belgrade-based Center for Geostrategic Studies concluded. Stalled Talks Between Serbia, Kosovo Kosovo unilaterally proclaimed independence from Serbia in 2008 - a move that Belgrade rejected. Russia, China, and five EU countries - Spain, Slovakia, Cyprus, Greece and Romania - have also refused to recognise Kosovo's independence. In 2011, Belgrade and Pristina engaged in EU-facilitated talks with the aim of normalising relations between the partially recognised state and Serbia, but the negotiations have been complicated. The 2013 Brussels Agreement on normalising relations and the 2015 accord on forming the Community of Serb Municipalities, a self-governing association of the Serb-dominated regions of Kosovo, have been the consultations' main results so far. The EU-brokered talks have remained stalled over the past years, while the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo remains tense. In November last year, authorities in Kosovo introduced a 100% tariff on imports from Serbia in retaliation for Belgrade blocking Kosovo's membership in international organisations and its campaign to get countries to revoke their recognition of the breakaway province. While over 100 UN member states recognise Kosovo’s independence, more than 10 countries formally revoked their recognition. In December 2018 Pristina's parliament voted to transform Kosovo’s existing security force [Kosovo Security Force] into a fully-fledged army. The move has drawn heavy criticism from Belgrade, which called it illegal and a violation of the UN Security Council resolutions The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "Despite US President Donald Trump’s fierce criticism of the New York Times and the Washington Post, the outlets’ mobile apps still appear to be on the president’s iPhone, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
    "articleText": "Trump’s apparent loyalty to the New York Times and Washington Post apps is interesting, especially since the White House announced last month that it was canceling its subscriptions to the two news outlets. “The New York Times, which is a fake newspaper - we don't even want it in the White House anymore. We're going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post,\" Trump said on Fox News' \"Hannity\" last month. “They're fake,\" Trump added. \"You take a look at the New York Times, and you take a look at the kind of reporting they do, it was all - it turned out to be all wrong.” Trump has long been a passionate critic of the outlets. In September, he called two Washington Post journalists “nasty lightweight reporters” after they published an article criticizing his administration. Trump added that the reporters “shouldn’t even be allowed on the grounds of the White House.” However, last month, Trump revealed that he may still be a Washington Post reader when he tweeted, “The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong.\" This is not the first time a US commander-in-chief has cancelled a subscription to a news outlet after taking issue with its reporting. President John F. Kennedy canceled the White House’s subscription to the New York Herald Tribune for alleged bias during his presidency, Politico reported. Kennedy eventually relented, and the White House’s subscription to the outlet was renewed.",

    "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on course to gaining nearly 18 percent in 2019, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index also enjoying respectable gains in Monday trading amid heightened hopes for a US-China trade deal and better than expected jobs numbers.",
    "articleText": "The Dow hit a new record of 27,500 points in Monday morning trading, with traders emboldened by good news in the October jobs report and the government’s third quarter GDP estimate which showed a 1.9 percent expansion between July and September, above the 1.6 percent expected by Wall Street. According to the October jobs report, the US added some 128,000 jobs for the month, above the 85,000 expected by economists. CNBC reports that the new record can be partially attributed to market hopes that the US could sign a trade deal with China in the near future and end the one-and-a-half-year long trade spat which has affected hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods from both countries. US and Chinese officials confirmed Friday that they had made substantial progress and reached a “consensus on principles” in efforts to reach a deal, with Trump later telling the press that he would like to see a deal demonstratively signed somewhere in the US by himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Adding to the good news for markets over the weekend, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the US would issue a third extension to licenses to US tech companies to continue selling their parts to China’s Huawei Technologies despite restrictions placed on the Chinese tech giant earlier this year. US tech companies including Microsoft and Intel had previously warned that they would lose billions of dollars if their ability to do business with Huawei was cut off. As of 1:30 pm, the Dow was up 0.4 percent, or 106 points, to 27,453 points, with the S&P posting gains of 0.4 percent, up 13.49 points to 3,080. The Nasdaq posted the strongest overall gains, and was up 0.6 percent, or 52 points, and sitting at 8,438 points. Strong showings were exhibited by Apple, which rallied over 25 percent in mid-day trading, with Intel, JP Morgan Chase and United Technologies showing gains of 10 percent or more. President Trump tweeted about the stock markets’ performance on Monday morning, but later published a second tweet accusing that “Fake News” media of ignoring the gains to only talk about “the Impeachment Hoax!” as Democratic lawmakers released the first redacted transcripts of testimony in the Trump impeachment probe. Stock Market hits RECORD HIGH. Spend your money well! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 ноября 2019 г. All-Time High for Stock Market and all the Fake News wants to talk about is the Impeachment Hoax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 ноября 2019 г. According to CNBC, the Dow’s performance on Monday is putting it on course to an 18 percent gain since the beginning of the year. The S&P, meanwhile, is up over 22 percent in 2019, with the Nasdaq up 27 percent for the year.",
