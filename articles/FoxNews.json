    "articleText": "close Video 'Friends' hosts respond to liberal 'Twitter-verse' melting down over Nationals player's MAGA hat At the White House Monday, Washington Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki looked as happy as a kid ripping open his presents on Christmas morning. Not because Suzuki just won a World Series. Not because he held the Commissioner’s Trophy. With a gleaming smile and outstretched arms, Suzuki donned a “Make America Great Again” hat while the president of the United States embraced him momentary in a hilariously awkward hug. It looked like a scene right out of the 1997 movie “Titanic.” Instant flashbacks to Jack holding Rose on the bow of the ship came to mind. Even critics of the Trump administration couldn’t help but laugh – or, predictably, unleash fury over how the memorable scene transpired on the South Lawn. TRUMP HUGS WASHINGTON NATIONALS' KURT SUZUKI, WEARING 'MAGA' HAT DURING WHITE HOUSE VISIT After instantly trending on Twitter, Suzuki said in a text message to USA Today: “It was amazing. That was the President. I was just trying to have fun.” Think about how ludicrous this is: A World Series champion had to explain to the media his decision to momentarily wear a hat. Apparently, a red MAGA hat is the new scarlet letter. You know what? It was amazing. The pundit chatter evolved past the trite question of the “will [insert sports team] go to the White House” argument. As a country we had something else to spark conversation, as comical as it was, other than the partisan vitriol that so frequently divides us. NATIONALS’ KURT SUZUKI CRITICIZED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER WEARING MAGA HAT That doesn’t mean the anti-Trump conversation didn’t exist. Seven Nationals players opted against going to the White House, including All-Star reliever Sean Doolittle, who publicly addressed his differences with Trump. But the 2019 rags-to-riches, unlikely World Series champions taught us that none of them actually cared about the views of their teammates concerning Trump. Despite their differences as individuals, the Nationals showed that as a team, physical presence isn’t necessary to support one another. If the Nationals played another Game 7 tomorrow, Doolittle, if asked, would take the mound and throw to Suzuki behind the plate. Without question, MAGA hat-wearing Suzuki would resume his responsibilities as a veteran catcher on the team and do his job. Who cares that one player possibly voted for Trump and another never would? On the field, they “stayed in the fight.” Off it, they remain friends. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This is how it should be for all of us. Once again, the Nationals taught us a lesson bigger than the game of baseball. More from Opinion Britt McHenry: New NCAA rules are the right call – Why? Because we live in a capitalist society Britt McHenry: Luck, Gronkowski and courage – Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is walk away Just like when the team was down-and-out at 19 and 31 in May and no one expected them to win the World Series, they clawed their way back to life. It didn’t matter that the press called for manager Davey Martinez to be fired. The teammates didn’t care about their minuscule chance at redemption. No, the Nationals persisted and clawed back to life to later win eight straight postseason games. They became the first MLB team in history to win all four World Series games on the road. The Nationals showed everyone that as long as you believe in your abilities, success is possible. The Nationals proved to us that a popular child’s song, “Baby Shark,” could rally an entire legion of adult fans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More importantly, that group of 25 men showed everyone who watched them that we can coexist as kind human beings even when we disagree politically. If social media users looked closer and contemplated a bit more introspection instead of firing up Twitter fingers in outrage at Suzuki, they might reap the benefits of learning a thing or two from the champs.

    "articleText": "close Video Trump offers support for 'war' on Mexican drug cartels after death of American family The president tweets that it is time for Mexico, with the help of the U.S., to 'wage war' on the drug cartels after the execution of nine members of a Mormon family; Griff Jenkins reports. At least nine American women and children were slaughtered in northern Mexico on Monday, the victims of cartel violence. Tragically, such carnage is all too common. The unchecked power of criminal enterprises in Mexico poses an unacceptable threat, not just to Mexico, but to the entire Western Hemisphere. The cartels’ reach extends from the tip of Latin America to Northern Canada. It’s past time for a common effort to break them. US VICTIMS OF MEXICAN CARTEL MASSACRE RANGE FROM 8-MONTH-OLD TWINS TO 43-YEAR-OLD MOTHER First, let’s be clear: this isn’t just about drugs. The cartels will traffic in anything that makes a buck. Most recently, they have cashed in on the rush to smuggle illegal aliens across the U.S. border. A report by RAND, for example, estimated that in 2017, the cartels made almost $3 billion dollars from human smuggling. To repeat: the problem isn’t drugs—it’s the cartels. These criminal networks aren’t just limited to the Western Hemisphere. Cartel smuggling networks extend to Africa, Europe and Asia as well. These gangs aren’t just smuggling operations; they are diversified enterprises. They engage in every manner of criminal activity from murder-for-hire to kidnapping, extortion, fraud, money laundering, car theft and on and on. Their avarice, braveness, ambition, and unconstrained violence would awe Al Capone. Video And, the danger they pose is not just to public safety. Where civic institutions and governance are weak, the criminal cartels intertwine with oligarchs. Together they seize control of political power and state-owned-enterprises, creating a stranglehold that chokes off civil society, democracy and the rule of law. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Venezuela is the poster child for this pernicious phenomenon. Nicolás Maduro has driven virtually the entire country into poverty--leading millions of refugees to flee the hellhole he and his cronies have created. Yet, despite international pressure, sanctions and internal opposition, his illegitimate regime still clings to power. In part, Maduro is still there because his regime is fueled by drug cash from the criminal cartels. Video Monday’s murder of innocent Americans—three women, two infants and four other children—shocks because of the senselessness and the brutality. Yet the harsh truth is that cartel-related violence in Mexico kills tens of thousands every year. Many of these are just as innocent, their lives just as precious innocent lives—people who deserved a far, far better fate.

Nope, here's the real culprit Brian Kilmeade: America never needed handouts to survive – and thrive Colin Reed: Biden may be leading Trump now, but don't count on him to become the Democratic nominee While the cartels are the real enemy here, we have to acknowledge that the Mexican government’s way of countering the threat has been largely wrong-headed. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly called AMLO, has generally adopted the old leftist policy of seeking “social peace”—a policy dedicated to the proposition that, if the government doesn’t go to after the cartels, the cartels won’t go after the government. Instead, the theory goes, they will largely confine their violence to terrorizing and murdering each other, and spend the rest of their time contentedly laundering their money and lounging by the pool. AMLO’s way is clearly not working. Mexico’s homicide rate has skyrocketed over the last two years. Before AMLO, the record for homicide was about 28,000 in 2011. Last year, under AMLO it was 35,000. This year will top that. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump has offered to partner with AMLO in fighting the cartels. AMLO should take him up on the offer. He won’t find a more resolute battle buddy. These two, very different leaders have proven they can work together. They have pressed for approval of a new trade deal. They have worked together on border security and refugee policy. They can do this. Trump and AMLO can go down in history as the leaders who broke the back of the cartels once and for all. AMLO should go for it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JAMES CARAFANO",

Shortly after Jim Bakker’s release from prison in July 1994, I invited the disgraced TV evangelist to my home. There was an important question I wanted to ask him. Some background: Bakker and his “Praise the Lord” (PTL) associates sold $1,000 “lifetime memberships” to people who were promised annual three-night stays at his Heritage USA luxury hotel complex in Fort Mill, South Carolina. According to what prosecutors revealed at his trial on fraud charges, Bakker sold tens of thousands of these memberships for a hotel that had only 500 rooms planned and was never completed. It was alleged Bakker kept $3.4 million of the money for himself and the rest paid for Heritage USA’s operating expenses. “When did you start to go wrong?” I asked Bakker. His answer was instructive: “When I began to surround myself with people who told me only what I wanted to hear.” JOHN KELLY WARNED OF IMPEACHMENT FOR TRUMP IF HE HIRED 'YES MAN': 'I FEEL BAD THAT I LEFT' I thought of that statement when I read a comment by former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who told a gathering in Sea Island, Georgia, sponsored by The Washington Examiner, what he had said to President Trump before leaving his position: “I said whatever you do, don’t hire a ‘yes man,’ someone who won’t tell you the truth — don’t do that, because if you do, I believe you will be impeached.” More from Opinion Cal Thomas: Impeachment inquiry like Halloween horror movie as establishment fights to run government Cal Thomas: Al-Baghdadi's death is a big deal.

As long as the objective is to help you succeed with your agenda, such advice can be valuable and even humbling, humility being one of humanity’s better characteristics and a grace that appears in short supply in Washington. The key to great leadership is to not overly regard yourself, to understand you don’t know everything, realize that, like everyone else, you are flawed and can make bad judgments, and to surround yourself with people who think well enough of you to tell you the truth from their perspective, even when it disagrees with yours. Another story along these lines was told to me by one of the late Billy Graham’s associates. After a particularly successful evening during which thousands came forward in response to an invitation to receive Christ as Savior, Graham and his team went back to their hotel room. The aide said he told Graham, “You’re not as great as they think you are.” He said Graham responded, “Don’t I know it.” Some of those evangelical “advisers” to President Trump might consider a verse with which they must be familiar. It is from Proverbs 15:22: “Plans go wrong for lack of advice; many advisers bring success.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Israel’s King Solomon is said to have written that and most of the Proverbs, which are as good a guidebook for living (and leading) as has ever been written, even for non-believers.

    "articleText": "close Video Biden campaign says Iowa isn't a must-win for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign manager touts former vice president's broad and diverse coalition of support; Peter Doocy reports. A summer of shaky debate performances morphed into an autumn dominated by his son’s lucrative business interests in Ukraine. A lackluster fundraising quarter led to broken promises on the role of outside money in politics. Yet through it all, former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained a steady general election lead over President Trump. A new Fox News poll shows Biden beating Trump by a healthy 12 points among registered voters, a wider margin than a month ago and the widest margin of any Democrat in the field. All this as the national debate over Hunter Biden is guaranteed to keep churning as long as impeachment is afoot. Much like the marquee Hillary Clinton versus Rudy Giuliani match-up prognosticators predicted in the fall of 2007, the odds of a Biden-Trump showdown are diminishing as the former vice president's path to the nomination gets murkier by the day. FRANK LUNTZ REVEALS UNPRECEDENTED FINDINGS ON HOW VOTERS VIEW PRESIDENT TRUMP Why? It’s not his advanced age or his son’s foreign business activities, although neither issue is without peril. It’s not his so-called “moderate” ideology, or the fact that his campaign is running on financial fumes. Joe Biden has a Rudy Giuliani problem – and it’s got nothing to do with Ukraine. More from Opinion Colin Reed: Beto O’Rourke’s failed far-left presidential campaign makes him unelectable in Texas Colin Reed: The Democratic nomination is now Warren's to lose (at least for the moment) First, take a step back. Since the day he launched his campaign in April, Biden has grounded his entire candidacy on electability, with a dash of throwback to the golden Obama years. He argues he is the best equipped to make Trump a one-term proposition. Never mind that much of the rest of the field also beats Trump in national polls, albeit by tighter margins. Biden has also struggled to articulate a discernible reason to support him. Electability does not make for a compelling long-term message. It’s a process argument rather than a substantive one. With voters, substance trumps process every time. It’s why Donald Trump is urging his GOP allies in impeachment to move on from their process arguments and defend him on the merits of what he did. Move beyond the national numbers and the warning signs are flashing for Team Biden. He’s falling further behind in the first two states of Iowa and New Hampshire. A pair of polls showed him slipping to fourth place in Iowa amid a steady drumbeat of support for South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. In New Hampshire, considering the hometown advantage enjoyed by neighboring senators from Vermont and Massachusetts, the Granite State was always going to be an uphill climb for Biden. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Recent political history teaches us that it’s very difficult to win later primaries after losing the early ones. During the 2008 Republican primary, Rudy Giuliani enjoyed a wide national lead throughout most of 2007. He promised a national “50-state campaign” in the general election where places like New Jersey, New York and Connecticut could no longer be taken for granted in the Democratic column. During the primaries, Giuliani wrote off the initial contests and placed all his chips on Florida. The rest of the field duked it out in the earlier states, notching wins and dominating media coverage. By the time the Sunshine State rolled around, Giuliani’s moment had passed, and he called it quits after a disappointing third-place finish. Unlike the Giuliani example, it’s unclear just where Biden is planning to try and plant his flag. Yes, he’s ahead in Nevada and South Carolina right now, but those leads could evaporate after heavy early losses, especially if Sanders throws in the towel and his supporters move over to Warren. Back then, Giuliani focused relentlessly on national security, reminding voters of his leadership bona fides from Sept. 11 to make the case that he was best equipped to become a wartime commander in chief. Giuliani’s message was so disciplined that one of the Democratic contenders quipped, “There's only three things he mentions in a sentence; a noun, a verb, and 9/11.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It was Joe Biden who delivered that line a dozen years ago. Ironically, he could apply the same zinger to his own campaign today if he replaced \"9/11\" with \"Barack Obama.\" Neither reminiscing about the past nor electability arguments can compete with early-state momentum. With the Iowa caucuses less than three months away, that spells trouble for Joe Biden. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COLIN REED",

One of the strangest things about liberals is how they think getting arrested is some kind of achievement. Take Jane Fonda, who, at the tender age of 81, is still ranting about capitalist America ruining the world. Only this time, the issue is \"climate change\" instead of the Cold War. \"Hanoi Jane\" infamously sat behind a communist antiaircraft gun in Vietnam in 1972, and today, one could imagine her aiming her big gun at commercial aircraft ruining the planet with their notorious carbon emissions. Naturally, liberal journalists are delighted. On Oct. 25, the Hollywood Reporter gushed over her third arrest on Capitol Hill. This time, actor Ted Danson was arrested alongside her. The Reporter included a pile of happy play-by-play tweets (including video tweets) by Hannah Jewell of The Washington Post. She seemed to be on a first-name basis with the socialist actress. JANE FONDA, TED DANSON ARRESTED IN DC FOR PROTESTING CLIMATE CHANGE \"Jane just asked a group of very buttoned up college kids on a capitol visit if they wanted to join her,\" she tweeted. \"Ted Danson added that getting arrested 'sharpens the mind.'\" (Insert laugh track here.) \"'When I turned 70 I thought ok, time to rest on my laurels' says Ted ... 'and then I met Jane Fonda'. He calls her his mentor. 'Here I am about to get arrested.'\" \"Ted Danson just shared a little handcuffed high five (high ten?) with Jane Fonda.\" \"Jane gets patted down and shouts 'Ted, are ya having fun yet?!'\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER More from Opinion Bozell & Graham: Will freedom of speech survive incredible attacks in America? Bozell and Graham: Democrats and media collude to impeach Trump and remove him from office This is nothing but an exercise in political vanity. Getting arrested sounds all naughty and risky — but there are no risks. The Capitol Police does not allow demonstrations on the Capitol grounds without a permit, so these leftists come unauthorized and play Martin Luther King for a day — unauthorized but not unannounced. Press attention (and adulation) is everything, so they make sure everyone knows they're coming. Protesters are put in single-use plastic handcuffs and usually taken to the Capitol Police garage. Fonda isn't sitting in jail over the weekend. No one's fining her $1,000 for the trouble. When Fonda was first arrested, on Oct. 14, the network morning shows were predictable stenographers to leftist protest. On NBC's \"Today\" show, Dylan Dreyer oozed: \"Fonda, who has a long history of political activism, has dubbed this 'Fire Drill Fridays.' ... She's still keeping busy, 81 years old.\" NBC White House reporter Peter Alexander chimed in: \"Yeah, lending her celebrity to the cause. That's great.\" On \"CBS This Morning,\" Saturday co-host Michelle Miller proclaimed: \"Oscar-winning actress and longtime activist Jane Fonda is hoping her latest role will make a lasting impression. Fonda was one of 16 people arrested outside the U.S. Capitol Friday while peacefully protesting climate change.\" She quoted Fonda as calling the state of the warming planet \"a collective crisis that demands collective action.\" This is not an actual demonstration of science. Jewell also quoted Fonda: \"'There was a time when there was no plastic' says Jane, 'and we did just fine.'\" (Plastic was invented before she was born but popularized in the 1960s I believe).\" ScienceHistory.org says the first fully synthetic plastic was invented in 1907 and became widely utilized in World War II. The left began protesting plastics in the '60s, so that's how liberal millennials at The Washington Post guess it all started. Science isn't really the point. Passing a Green New Deal that takes over what remains of American capitalism is the point. Left-wing radicals haven't changed their authoritarian agenda one bit since their glory days of rooting against America in Vietnam. Jane Fonda is the same self-absorbed dilettante that she was in 1972 ... and she's still celebrated for it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But here's a red brick of reality: It ain't working. The purpose of this form of political activism is to create a national movement that supports it and emulates it.

When families left everything to move to the wilderness, they received no relocation grants. There were no chambers of commerce to help them settle in, no Home Depots, and no supermarkets. If you moved, you carried what you needed, and you could not blame anyone for hardship. You depended on yourself, and your family counted on you. That was the American mindset: the freedom to pursue, the freedom to fail, and the belief that one could and would succeed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Reading today’s news and watching the Democratic Party's presidential debates, I see that America has lost that drive. We live in an era in which one politician promises us a thousand dollars a month because automation makes employment challenging, while another promises baby bucks because some parents might not have as much as others. Meanwhile, an avowed socialist wants to take all your hard-won gains (but keep his) and spread the wealth around. Of course, we can’t forget Elizabeth Warren, who vilifies the wealthy and promises to tax them even more the very day she steps in office, because, certainly, the very rich must not deserve what they earn. WARREN UNDER FIRE ON ‘MEDICARE-FOR-ALL’ AS SHE NOW CLAIMS BILLIONAIRES ALONE CAN FUND IT While some of us do need a hand up, whining, demanding, and blaming has never been part of America’s character, nor has asking others for the money they worked for been something we subscribed to. We’ve never looked at the rich and successful with disdain, because, in the past, we all believed we were climbing up the ladder, and if not yet, soon, and if not us, then our kids would.

    "articleText": "close Video Ilhan Omar Rallies Against Western Imperialism Rep. Ilhan Omar stumps for Sen. Bernie Sanders at a University of Minnesota rally. Byron York of The Washington Examiner and Fox Nation Host Tomi Lahren provide perspective. The United States of America has been perhaps the greatest force for good that the world has ever seen, but many Democrats believe otherwise. Their blindness to America’s virtues makes it impossible for them to utilize those virtues effectively. At a Minnesota rally at which she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for the Democratic presidential nomination, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., proclaimed that the socialist senator from Vermont would end “Western imperialism.” Omar’s remarks are just the most recent incendiary anti-American statements to come from “the Squad” — the group of four far-left Democrats in the House of Representatives who are driving their party’s embrace of radical politics. The Squad’s downright disdain for our country is appalling, so receiving the endorsement of one of its most outspoken members should be more of a liability to Sanders' campaign than an asset. ILHAN OMAR, AT BERNIE SANDERS RALLY, CALLS FOR 'MASS MOVEMENT OF THE WORKING CLASS' AMID 'LOCK HIM UP' CHANTS Omar and the other members of the Squad consider America a force for evil in the world. As a result, they are working to undermine American exceptionalism at home and our standing abroad. When Omar says that Sanders will end “Western imperialism,” she means that he’ll unilaterally surrender America’s power and influence in the world. More from Opinion Mike Huckabee: Trump economy is delivering higher incomes and record employment for Americans Liz Peek: Two Pelosi errors that could cost Democrats the election in 2020 Throughout her tenure in office, and even before, Omar has made her anti-American worldview perfectly clear. Who could forget Omar drawing a moral equivalence between the United States and Al Qaeda? Or, when she wrote off the 9/11 attacks as “some people did something?” Or, the many times she sent anti-Semitic tweets evoking age-old stereotypes about Jews? Omar recently gave another prime example of her blame-America-first attitude when she refused to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide at the hands of Turkey during World War I. As she later explained, she just couldn’t bring herself to support a resolution that didn’t include criticism of the United States. “A true acknowledgment of historical crimes against humanity must include both the heinous genocides of the 20th century, along with earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide, which took the lives of hundreds of millions of indigenous people in this country,” Omar said, exaggerating the number of Native Americans on this continent during the time of European settlement and American expansion. Such exploitative language clouds reasonable discussions about our history and denies the reality of American greatness at home and in the world. Omar’s bogus rationalization for voting against the resolution was just an excuse to trash America, and once again it came at the expense of moral legitimacy. In 2001, when I was governor of Arkansas, I signed a proclamation recognizing the Armenian genocide because it was the appropriate thing to do. The facts of the case are clear, and it’s morally wrong for Omar to deny the destruction of more than a million innocent people, especially while using it as an opportunity to attack her adopted homeland. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Despite the bevy of public statements showcasing Omar’s deep-rooted anti-American sentiment, Democrats still refuse to disavow the first-term congresswoman. In fact, they consistently rally to her defense. Omar boasts the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other prominent members of the party, who even went so far as to neuter a House resolution that was meant to condemn Omar’s anti-Semitic comments. Democrats haven’t even tried to remove Omar from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs — the powerful committee that guides American foreign policy — despite her disparaging attitude toward our own country as well as many of our closest allies. By accepting Omar’s endorsement, Sanders gave his imprimatur to the Democratic Party’s burgeoning anti-America faction. Of course, that shouldn’t surprise anyone, considering Sanders' own long history of cozying up to America’s enemies, which includes spending his honeymoon in the Soviet Union. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP America has been a beacon of hope to oppressed and impoverished people the world over throughout our history, standing against tyranny and delivering life-saving aid to the world’s poor without asking anything more in return than enough ground to bury our dead and respect for our rights abroad.

    "description": "Promising to double everyone's taxes is no way to win an election.",
    "articleText": "close Video Warren unveils $52 trillion Medicare for All plan Jason Nichols and William A. Jacobson react. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has released her plan for financing \"Medicare-for-all.\" She claims it’ll cost \"just\" $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years, with, in her words, \"not one penny in middle-class tax increases.\" Warren has little choice but to indulge in fuzzy math. After all, doubling everyone's taxes or delivering a blow to the economy more severe than the Great Recession is no way to win an election. Numerous policy wonks – from those at the Urban Institute, to Charles Blahous at the Mercatus Center, to Emory University economist Ken Thorpe – have pegged the cost of \"Medicare-for-all\" at more than $30 trillion over 10 years. Warren’s ideological fellow traveler Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., admits \"Medicare-for-all\" would run more than $30 trillion over a decade. JUSTIN HASKINS: HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE-FOR'ALL' REALLY COST THE MIDDLE CLASS? THE ANSWER IS SHOCKING On Oct. 28, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget dove into how the federal government could possibly come up with $30 trillion. First, the CRFB posited a new 32 percent payroll tax, on top of the existing 15.3 percent payroll tax. That would make the total payroll tax on most wage income more than 47 percent. Payroll tax hikes of that size would contract the U.S. economy by 3.5 percent – the equivalent of a $3,200 pay cut for the average American, on top of all those new taxes. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Not a fan of a 47 percent tax on each and every job? How about a new 25 percent income surtax above the level of the standard deduction – $12,200 for individuals and $24,400 for married couples? The bottom tax rate would jump from 10 percent to 35 percent; the top tax rate would surge to 62 percent. Capital gains and dividends would be subject to a tax rate of nearly 50 percent. More from Opinion Sally Pipes: ObamaCare, not Trump, is adding to the number of uninsured Americans Sally Pipes: Elizabeth Warren misleads Americans on harm and costs of 'Medicare-for-all' We could also just double individual and corporate income tax rates to come up with the $30 trillion \"Medicare-for-all\" requires over 10 years. The bottom rate would go to 20 percent; the top rate, to 74 percent. The federal government would claim nearly 48 percent of capital gains. Corporations would pay 42 percent of their income to the federal Treasury – almost 20 percentage points more than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. Or we could go the way of Europe and Canada and adopt a value-added tax. The CRFB projects that a 42 percent VAT would raise the necessary $30 trillion over 10 years. Think of it as a hefty sales tax – the VAT would immediately increase the prices of most goods and services 42 percent. What if we adopt the framing of Sanders and Warren – and assume the premiums we pay to private insurers would simply become taxes under \"Medicare-for-all\"? The CRFB estimates that these mandatory premiums would have to average $7,500 per person – or $12,000 per person not currently on public insurance. They’d have to be even higher for families – $20,000 per household, by the CRFB’s reckoning. The CRFB also modeled how much spending the federal government would have to cut elsewhere to free up $30 trillion over 10 years. The answer? Eighty percent. \"Cuts of this magnitude are unrealistically large and certainly could not be imposed on a short timeline,\" the CRFB said. Yes, it's safe for the CRFB to say that trimming Social Security benefits from $18,000 to $3,600 a year, or reducing military headcount from 1.3 million to 270,000, is unrealistic. Some advocates of \"Medicare-for-all\" argue we don't need to \"pay\" for it. Deficits don't matter, right? That would more than double the national debt, to 205 percent of GDP – almost double the record debt level we faced after World War II. It would shrink the economy by 5 percent and reduce individual incomes an average of $4,500 by 2030. Finally, there's the approach preferred by Sanders and Warren – soaking the rich. The CRFB estimates that hiking the top tax rate to 70 percent, phasing out tax breaks for high earners, doubling the corporate tax rate, imposing a wealth tax, and taxing financial institutions would raise just one-third of \"Medicare-for-all\"'s $30 trillion 10-year price tag. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even confiscating all income above $204,000 for individuals and $408,000 for couples would fail to cover the cost of \"Medicare-for-all.\" And that’s without considering the fact that people would stop working after their incomes reached those thresholds. None of the CRFB’s eight potential ways of paying for \"Medicare-for-all\" will ever gain the support of the American people. That’s why Warren has resorted to financial fantasy.

    "description": "Yes, I'd say this impeachment is about abuse of power. It's about the DEMOCRATS' abuse of power.",
    "articleText": "close Video Trump Wars: The System Strikes Back The Dems proved this past week how partisan this impeachment inquiry really is. Last week, the Democrats made it official. They finally took a vote on their partisan impeachment and proved just how partisan it really is, with not a single Republican in favor. But as many have pointed out, the vote doesn't make this legitimate. In fact, the truth is the exact opposite of what the Democrats and their lackeys in the ruling class state media have been saying -- that Republicans focus on process because the facts are bad. That is dead wrong. Yes, the process favors the Democrats. But the facts favor President Trump. Nothing -- not a single fact in this case -- comes close to justifying the overturning of an election. That's why the Democrats and the media are so hysterical. TRUMP WANTS REPUBLICANS TO RELEASE THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS FROM IMPEACHMENT PROBE Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.: ... Putting both our democracy and the nation's security in jeopardy. Brian Williams, MSNBC host: The most treacherous phase of his time in office thus far. Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass.: The betrayal of this president of his oath of office, of the integrity of the 2020 elections, and of our national security ... Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich.: This is my most disturbing day in Congress. As a public service to you, the American people, we will fact-check the hysterics on \"The Next Revolution,\" and bring you, as we promised to do, the facts every Sunday as long as this farce goes on, the truth about impeachment. Let's start with the speeches on the impeachment vote and possibly the most partisan of that all the House Democrats -- and that's saying something -- Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.: The House impeachment Inquiry is about abuse of power. \"Abuse of power.\" Let's see, when you refuse to accept the result of an election, mobilize the resources of the state to pursue a Russia conspiracy theory aimed at overturning that election, and the second that falls apart, drop it in favor a new effort to overturn an election through non-democratic means, yes, I'd say this impeachment is about abuse of power. It's about the Democrats' abuse of power. Next, here's more from Jeffries: Jeffries: It's about betrayal. Oh, really? Weren't you the ones who said when you took the majority last year, you'd focus on health care and infrastructure and work for the Americans and then dumped all of that in favor of this impeachment obsession. Yes, it sounds like betrayal to me -- the Democrats' betrayal of their voters. And there's more: Jeffries: It's about corruption. Corruption. The only actual corruption allegation in this whole story is the one against Joe Biden -- cash for gas. Vice President Biden channeling U.S. taxpayer money to a Ukrainian gas company paying his son. But instead of investigating it, the Democrats want to impeach the guy who wants it investigated. That's how much they care about corruption. Jeffries: It's about national security. What? How is it about national security? If he means it's about standing up to Russia, the Democrats should impeach themselves because no one has been as weak on Russia as they were under Obama. Jeffries: It's about the undermining of our elections. Well, he is right about that. Undermining our elections is what the Democrats have been doing every day since 2016. Jeffries: It's about defending our democracy for the people. Oh please. If you want to defend democracy for the people, why don't you let them choose the next president instead of a cabal of politicians in Washington. And Jeffries finished up with this little gem, one that was endlessly repeated by all the rest of them. Jeffries: No one is above the law. Yes, I think that needs a bit of a qualifier, Hakeem. No one is above the law except Joe Biden, who is accused of directing billions of dollars in taxpayer cash to the Ukrainian gas industry and his family's business. And when anyone asks questions about it, they get impeached. Joe Biden wants to be president. Don't you think we need to know if he channeled U.S. aid into his son's company? \"No one is above the law.\" What a total joke these people are! But all of that was nothing compared to the vomit-inducing display of hypocrisy from the Queen of Corruption, Nancy Pelosi. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Sadly, this is not any cause for any glee or comfort. This is something that is very solemn, that is something prayerful. \"Solemn and prayerful.\" What? Like this? Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.: Impeach 45! Crowd (chanting): Impeach 45! Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.: Because we're going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother------. \"Solemn and prayerful.\" My God. But Pelosi topped even that. I can't quite believe she read out these words, but she did. She honestly did. Pelosi: Yes, as we go forward with this, we will do so in a way that brings people together, that is healing rather than dividing. \"Healing.\" For months, she said you can't do impeachment unless it's bipartisan. She has not a single Republican in favor of it. But now she goes ahead anyway. And then says it's going to bring people together -- \"healing.\" She literally said \"healing.\" This is the most divisive political act in, what, 50 years? One hundred years? More? And she talks about healing... right. One little bit of fact-checking from last week, if I may. The Democrats wheeled out another disgruntled bureaucrat, Alexander Vindman, and it was another bombshell that turned out to be a damp squib. The transcript of the phone call wasn't verbatim. There were words left out. Yes, we knew that. Yes, I'd say this impeachment is about abuse of power. It's about the DEMOCRATS' abuse of power. Officials were concerned about the phone call and talked to superiors about it. Yes, we knew that. Alexander Vindman is a decorated military veteran. Yes, and good for him. He was obviously a hero in military life. But now he's in civilian life, and in a constitutional federal republic, we don't blindly follow military figures. That's the kind of soldier worship you get in a banana republic. So let's fact-check Vindman's central claim. He said, \"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" More from Opinion Norquist & Gleason: Fate our nation's most important taxpayer protection measure hangs in the balance Michael Goodwin: De Blasio, Cuomo show sneering hostility as Trump leaves New York Liz Peek: Two Pelosi errors that could cost Democrats the election in 2020 Oh, yes, terribly worried. But hang on a second. Vindman was a senior official throughout the Obama administration, from 2008 responsible for Eurasia, working in Ukraine and Russia. He returned to work for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, focusing on Russia, and then another senior Pentagon job. All those eight years when Obama refused to send any proper military aid to Ukraine, when he sent blankets instead of the weapons that President Trump actually did send, not a peep came out of Alexander Vindman or any of these career civil servants coming out of the woodwork to now proclaim the vital importance of military aid to Ukraine. As for Vindman's concern about investigating a U.S. citizen, he makes it sound like the president wanted Ukraine to poke around in Grandma Mary's knicker drawer. We're talking about a former vice president who is accused of funneling billions of dollars of taxpayer money to a shady gas company paying his son. Of course, that should be investigated! And by the way, to all the ruling class robots endlessly reciting, \"Is it appropriate to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival?\" -- of course, it is! The fact that Biden is President Trump's political rival is the reason he should be investigated. He wants to be president. Don't you think we need to know if he channeled U.S. aid into his son's company? And the fact that the money went to Ukraine is the reason we need to ask a foreign government to help with the investigation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Isn't it hilarious that the ruling class cares more about a request to investigate corruption than the actual corruption? That's because what Hunter Biden did in Ukraine, in China and God knows where else is the ruling class business model. That's why they're all defending him, and that's why they're out to get Trump -- because he is exposing it. So as we keep telling you, this whole impeachment thing, it is truly the system striking back and trying to cancel the populist revolution. We must not let them.

It is an article of faith among political analysts that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a master strategist, and indeed her career is studded with significant accomplishments. Yet, more recently, she has made two grievous errors that could well cost Democrats the election in 2020. The first was putting Adam Schiff in charge of the impeachment inquiry. The second is not reining in the so-called Squad, or the four female freshmen Democrats whose extreme progressive voices have helped push the Democrat party to the left, alienating much of the country. The other day, Pelosi warned at a meeting with Bloomberg that the policies embraced by far-left candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could prevent Democrats from retaking the White House in 2020. NEWT GINGRICH: PELOSI'S HALLOWEEN IMPEACHMENT VOTE WAS AN ENORMOUS STRATEGIC DEFEAT – LET ME EXPLAIN The speaker accurately pointed out that Democrats need to win swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania to take back the White House, and that voters in those states are not on board with uber-liberal policies like the Green New Deal and “Medicare-for-All.” “Remember November,” she said. “You must win the Electoral College.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Moderate Democrats might suggest that Pelosi has not helped that cause. She woefully underestimated the clout of social media darlings Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley (aka the Squad), initially dismissing them and deriding their policies. More from Opinion Donald Trump Jr: Mueller probe was farce by Trump-hating Democrats who want to take my father down Justin Haskins: Warren health care plan would be a devastating national nightmare and harm all Americans Andy Puzder: Left gets Trump economy wrong again — and the reason is ... Instead of courting the outspoken newcomers, and trying to modulate their voices, Pelosi initiated a feud which only enhanced their following and the divisions within the party. AOC ultimately accused Pelosi of “singling out” Democrat women of color, which she deemed “disrespectful.” Imagine: an upstart freshman Democrat calling out Nancy Pelosi. The Squad has helped boost enthusiasm for extreme policies like the Green New Deal, raised millions of dollars for left-wing causes and threatened to “primary” Democrats not deemed sufficiently progressive. They have especially emboldened younger voters, and recently jumped into the 2020 race by endorsing Bernie Sanders. Bill Maher opined that the plug for Sanders could allow Elizabeth Warren to shift toward the middle; that is wishful thinking. If anything, it prompts Warren to continue her progressive agenda, confident that when Bernie falls back, his followers will come to her. Warren appears to be the rising front-runnner; her determined left-wing politics are rattling moderate Democrats, including Pelosi. Having opposed taking a full House vote authorizing the investigation, Pelosi finally succumbed to the public outcry demanding transparency, and held a vote last week. But it’s not just liberal policies that threaten Democrats’ chances heading into 2020. Those toss-up states also do not favor impeachment. A New York Times/Siena poll from mid-October found that in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona, 53 percent of voters do not approve of impeaching and removing the president from office, while only 43 percent approve. That’s good news for the president, especially if voters in those states sour on the impeachment process, as they might with House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff at the helm. Nancy Pelosi picked one of the most divisive figures in the House when she chose Schiff to oversee the impeachment inquiry, essentially ditching any effort to make the probe appear a bipartisan or non-political effort. Normally, the Judiciary Committee oversees an impeachment investigation. Admittedly, having watched Jerry Nadler, who heads that committee, make a complete hash of recent hearings on the Mueller report, Pelosi was in a tough spot. Still, Schiff is toxic, and she knew that. Schiff’s aggressive and dishonest posture on the Russiagate probe has earned him the enmity of Republicans. A number of times Schiff claimed to have “proof” of Trump’s guilt, only to later come up short. Even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivered his report, stating he found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, Schiff doggedly insisted in an interview, “Undoubtedly there is collusion…” After the Mueller report was published, Republicans on the Intel Committee asked Schiff to step down, suggesting someone so politically biased could not be trusted. He refused, but despite the accusation, Pelosi decided to make him ringmaster of the impeachment circus. That was a serious error. As head of the impeachment probe, Schiff lied again, saying he had had no contact with the “whistleblower” that kicked off the investigation, when in fact he had. Many Republicans believe that Schiff coordinated with the anonymous accuser to mount the attack on the president. They also charge him with presiding over an unfair process, holding closed-door hearings and leaking only those tidbits favorable to Democrats. Having opposed taking a full House vote authorizing the investigation, Pelosi finally succumbed to the public outcry demanding transparency, and held a vote last week. The vote on a process resolution revealed some fracturing of her caucus, which includes 30 seats held in Trump-won districts. That was an uncomfortable vote for those representatives; two voted against the impeachment drive. Meanwhile, the country is nearly evenly divided on impeachment, with independents, according to a recent Washington Post poll, opposing the measure by a slim margin. As the inquiry moves into a more public phase, voters will likely tire of endless TV-broadcast interviews and breathless reporting that unearths no new information. As the weeks drag on, they will begin to realize that, just as in the Mueller probe, there is inconclusive evidence of wrong-doing. Then they will begin to question how much taxpayer time and money is sunk into an impeachment investigation that is politically motivated and that, barring any new smoking guns, will die in the Senate. They will then ask Democrats: what have you done for us lately? Have you passed the Mexico-Canada-US trade deal? Have you worked on infrastructure? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Voters know what President Trump has done for them. They see it weekly in their paychecks, they see it when it comes time to sell their house and the price has gone up. They see it when they want to switch jobs, and find plenty to choose from, or when it comes time to tap their IRAs. In November 2020, voters will be asked again: Are you better off than you were four years ago? And then they will reelect Donald Trump. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

    "articleText": "close Video Mary Anne Marsh: Why Trump shouldn't underestimate Nancy Pelosi Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh explains why President Trump and his Republican allies should not underestimate Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Following 10 busy days that included leading a bipartisan delegation to the Mideast in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, an unannounced trip to meet Afghanistan’s president and visit U.S. commanders and troops there, and delivering back-to-back eulogies for her brother Thomas D’Allessandro and beloved colleague Elijah Cummings, Nancy Pelosi moved with military precision to deliver the votes for the impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump. Thursday morning, the day of the House vote, Kellyanne Conway told Fox News “Impeachment is simple math, you either have the votes or you don't. And guess what – dirty little secret – they don't have the votes,\" she said. A few hours later, standing next to an image of the American flag on the House floor, House Speaker Pelosi made the case for proceeding with an impeachment inquiry: DAN GAINOR: NEW YOR TIMES ENGAGES IN IMPEACHMENT FANTASIES “These actions, this process, these open hearings, seeking the truth and making it available to the American people, will inform Congress on the very difficult decisions we will have to make in the future as to whether to impeach the president. “That decision has not been made. That's what the inquiry will investigate and then we can make the decision, based on the truth. I don't know why the Republicans are afraid of the truth. Every member should support allowing the American people to hear the facts for themselves. This – that is really what this vote is about. It is about the truth. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER “And, what is at stake? What is at stake, in all of this, is nothing less than our democracy.” When Pelosi concluded her speech, she ascended the rostrum, took the gavel, and presided over the House vote to initiate an impeachment inquiry. It passed 232-196. More from Opinion Newt Gingrich: Pelosi’s Halloween impeachment vote was an enormous strategic defeat – Let me explain Andy Puzder: Left gets Trump economy wrong again — and the reason is ... Donald Trump Jr: Mueller probe was farce by Trump-hating Democrats who want to take my father down Clearly, Nancy Pelosi had the votes. The recent picture of Pelosi standing up to Trump in the White House is the perfect symbol of how she is handling impeachment. In command and in control, Pelosi is orchestrating every detail of the impeachment process to hold Trump accountable since the disclosure of his call to Ukraine’s president to discuss withholding military funds and the investigation of his political rival Joe Biden. From beginning the process in the Intelligence Committee under Rep. Adam Schiff, to conducting interviews and gathering testimony of key witnesses, to the timing of Thursday’s vote, and then selling the vote in a series of high-profile interviews while her colleagues joined her across the country using the same message, Pelosi’s fingerprints are on every detail. Pelosi knows that the more Americans learn about Trump’s actions the more they will support impeachment and removal. In addition, Pelosi has surgically removed every reason Republicans’ have offered to oppose the inquiry. Their cries about the process, closed hearings, and lack of a full House vote have all been eliminated. Now, Republicans are left to argue what Trump’s intent was in making the call to President Volodymyr Zelensky. That seems clear enough. Attempting to solicit information about Biden would clearly benefit the Trump campaign, and it is illegal to solicit, accept or receive assistance from any foreign government for any U.S. election. As the public has learned more, support for Trump’s impeachment and removal has increased. The recent ABC-Washington Post poll measuring impeachment and removal from office showed 49 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed. That has increased since the same poll in July when 37 percent supported impeachment and removal and 59 percent were opposed. That’s a 12-point increase in three months based largely on private testimony reported by the media. Even more telling in the latest poll is that 47 percent of Independents support impeachment and removal while 18 percent of Republicans support it. This is all the result of Pelosi’s methodical, disciplined approach to the inquiry. She knows that the more Americans learn about Trump’s actions the more they will support impeachment and removal. Now, more evidence will be made public in a series of high-profile hearings that could show Trump’s conduct is an abuse of power, betrayal of our national security, and corruption of our elections. All of which would add up to betraying his oath of office and our Constitution, as well as jeopardizing our national security. When Pelosi sets her sights on something she will not be denied. Last January, Pelosi was scheduled to lead a delegation to Afghanistan. At the last minute, Trump revoked her delegation’s access to a military plane. It was political payback for her suggestion that he postpone the State of the Union until the government shutdown was over. Ten months later, Pelosi and a bipartisan congressional delegation landed in Afghanistan. And 10 days later she presided over the vote to start an impeachment inquiry of Trump. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM At this point, Trump should have learned that every time he tries to thwart Pelosi she calls his bluff and prevails. Never underestimate Nancy Pelosi. Ever.

    "articleText": "close Video Media, Democrats bash President Trump over al-Baghdadi raid Trump's critics refuses to credit the president for the mission that killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi; reaction on 'The Five.' Last weekend, President Trump announced incredible news for our country. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and self-proclaimed “caliph” of the depraved Islamic State terrorist group, was eliminated by U.S. forces. Al-Muhajir, who was set to replace al-Baghdadi, was also taken out. This is a victory for our military, our country and the world. It is a triumph for global security. Our entire country should be celebrating this victory, just as we did when Osama Bin Laden was killed. Instead, the death of the world’s most wanted terrorist has been met by crickets. It’s appalling to see the “Washington bubble elite” brush off this massive feat. TONY PERKINS: PRAY AND ACT FOR PERSECUTED CHRISTIANS WORLDWIDE – HERE'S WHY The day after al-Baghadi was killed, some beltway insiders at the World Series actually booed Trump. The Washington Post, perhaps to downplay the significance of this achievement, produced a headline calling al-Baghdadi an “austere religious scholar.” This shows just how out of touch they are with reality. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER When you consider what al-Baghdadi and his barbaric terrorist regime have done, these partisan antics look even more disgusting. When al-Baghadi founded ISIS, he had one goal in mind: apocalypse. He wanted to violently overthrow the world order and replace it with an Islamic caliphate. More from Opinion Justin Haskins: Warren health care plan would be a devastating national nightmare and harm all Americans Newt Gingrich: Pelosi’s Halloween impeachment vote was an enormous strategic defeat – Let me explain Chuck DeVore: Beto O’Rourke had nothing to offer voters but criticism of Trump We have seen how far they are willing to go to achieve that goal. American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded. Twenty-six-year-old Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian worker helping Syrian refugees, was forced into sex slavery and assaulted by al-Baghdadi repeatedly. She was later killed. Twenty-one Coptic Christians were beheaded on a beach in Libya. A Jordanian pilot was set on fire inside a cage. Crucified bodies were hung up in conquered territories. That liberals are attempting to minimize or distract from this news is insulting enough. However, they have taken further actions that directly threaten the future success of our ongoing campaign against ISIS. Right now, Democrats are holding up passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and defense appropriations bills because they object to Trump’s border wall. These bills provide the critical funding and necessary authorities for our military operations to succeed. Without full defense funding, our military will not be equipped to maintain its edge against America’s enemies. Democrats are putting politics over our women and men in uniform. Over the last 50 years, there have been three separate occasions where military spending was cut by at least 25 percent – all from Democratic administrations. That is precisely why Congress has passed the defense bill every year for nearly six decades, regardless of whatever political debate was going on at the time. Now, Democrats are once again trying not to fund the military. They are putting politics over our women and men in uniform. They would rather obsess over the sham impeachment proceedings and the border wall than negotiate in good faith to pass the NDAA and fund the military. This is absolutely reckless, because we still have more work to do in ending terrorism globally. Contrary to the left’s propaganda, our strategy in Syria has not changed. We have not abandoned our partners, the Kurds. We are still working alongside them and the Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Syria. Under President Trump, we are still committed to our strategy to defeat ISIS, protect Iraq, deter Iran and support Israel. Consistent with that strategy, we eliminated their territorial caliphate earlier this year. We have just taken out the current ISIS leader and his potential successor. Now, we will deny ISIS access to revenue from oil fields to prevent it from reconstituting itself. We can achieve this mission if we give our armed services the unified support they deserve. Passage of the NDAA and defense funding bills, as well as a bipartisan celebration of al-Baghdadi’s death, is a good place to start. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Never forget, al-Baghdadi founded ISIS and inspired their many atrocities.

    "articleText": "close Video Finding Jesus through Yeezus? Director of Ministry Intelligence at the American Bible Society Dr. John Farquhar Plake provides free bibles to Kanye fans. It’s no secret Kanye West’s “Jesus is King” album set the internet on fire over the past week. Fox News reported that Google searches for “Jesus” and “Christian beliefs” significantly spiked since the album’s release on Oct. 25, and it has sparked both social media and real-life conversations among countless Christians and skeptics. After listening to the songs and watching several of West’s interviews where he explains the reasoning behind his drastic change of behavior and newly professed “sonship” to the Kingdom of God, I’m convinced God is using him to inspire both believers and non-believers alike. In his appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” West was asked if he now considers himself a “Christian music artist.” Kanye responded, “I’m just a Christian everything.” He told Zane Lowe in an interview for Apple Music that he is in “complete service” to God and now approaches everything — specifically, his music, design innovation and family life, to the goal of bringing glory to Jesus’ kingdom. GREG LAURIE: DEAR KANYE WEST – WELCOME TO THE FAMILY OF GOD AS A FOLLOWER OF JESUS CHRIST Christians should look to Kanye’s transformation as both an inspiration and a call to approach our lives with the same boldness and one-mindedness. Sadly, it can be tempting and even easy to let our faith get watered down or cast aside, labeling it as an “aspect” of our lives rather than the source of our purpose. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER My hope is that God will use the “Jesus is King” album to remind believers that we are ALL called to identify ourselves as “Christian everything” — in other words — we should view ourselves as children of God above all other identifiers and thus make every decision based upon that vision.

Christians should never doubt their capability to plant seeds in the hearts of those around them — in doing so, they’re actually doubting God. We need MORE conversation about who God is, even if skeptics feel the need to criticize our beliefs. And just look at what He can do! As Kanye said in his interview with Lowe, God “has a sense of humor.” He uses the most unlikely people to work for Him because it points further to His power. If God can transform the heart of someone you NEVER thought possible, does that not inspire non-believers to ask questions about who He is and what about Him inspired such change? I’ve loved reading the online commentaries about the “Jesus is King” album. We need MORE conversation about who God is, even if skeptics feel the need to criticize our beliefs. Criticism and even doubt can lead people to the path of finding God’s truth. He works in mysterious ways and can truly use anything to bring people to His love and direction.

    "articleText": "close Video Vietnam veteran stands up to armed carjackers on Memorial Day Three men armed with guns confronted a veteran in Milwaukee and demanded his keys but took off after they were told no. In September 1965, five months after my husband, Col. Carlyle \"Smitty\" Harris, crashed his plane over Vietnam and disappeared, I was getting accustomed to living in Tupelo, Miss. I was told by the casualty officer that they didn’t know if he had survived the crash, but I knew in my heart that Smitty was alive. Although we had only lived in Tupelo a couple of months, I already knew I could not have picked a better spot to raise my three small children. With a population of 17,000, everyone knew everyone, and in the hospitable Southern way, the town quickly welcomed me and the children warmly and without question. TARA MCCLARY REEVES: THIS MEMORIAL DAY, REMEMBER RALPH JOHNSON, WHO TRADED HIS LIFE FOR YOUR FREEDOM While other POW wives were experiencing the negative effects of antiwar activists, I was experiencing the open arms of acceptance and support. As I settled into my new home, I fluctuated between being grateful and overwhelmed. It was tough navigating so many changes without Smitty’s help and support, but not knowing how he was faring was simply terrible. One day, around four in the afternoon, I received a call from the local postmaster, Banks Livingston. I answered the phone, and he quickly got straight to the point. “Mrs. Harris, I think I have a letter for you from your husband,” he said all in one breath. “You have what?” I practically screamed in the phone. More from Opinion Russell Hanson: I am a Vietnam veteran. Here's why I chose to #WalkAway Newt Gingrich: The Medal of Honor is a proud American tradition “I think I have a letter from your husband. It is addressed to Louise Harris, Tupelo, Mississippi. There’s no street address on it. In the top left corner, it says Carlyle Smith Harris.” “Oh, Mr. Livingston! Where are you and how can I get it?” “I’ll meet you at the back door of the post office,” he quickly replied. I called to my niece, Deb, to please watch my three small children, and I hopped into my car and practically flew to the post office. True to his word, Mr. Livingston was waiting at the back door. He handed me the letter, and with one look I exclaimed, “It’s from him! I recognize the handwriting!” My name and Smitty’s name were definitely in his handwriting, though the partial address was in a different script. Overcome with joy, I threw my arms around a startled Mr. Livingston. He seemed as excited as I was, and he hugged me right back. I immediately took the letter home, intent on opening it with the children, wanting to share this moment, this precious memory, with them. I ran into the house, and Deb helped me gather all three around me on the couch. With shaking hands, I opened the envelope and unfolded the paper that Smitty’s hands had also held. It was dated Friday, June 25, 1965. Careful to keep my emotions in check, I read the letter aloud. Dearest Louise, Words cannot express my love and concern for you and the girls and our new baby boy. My thoughts and prayers are with you constantly. The people here found out and advised me of the birth of our son and that you both were OK. I have never had happier news. Because of you and the kids, I can still say I am the luckiest man on earth. Louise — please don’t worry about me because it is completely unnecessary. I am uninjured, healthy, in good spirits, and well taken care of. I am living with other American pilots, and we get plenty of good food, clothes, medical care if required, and adequate living and hygiene facilities. I paused slightly, wondering if this part was true. I knew Smitty might try to paint a better picture so that I wouldn’t worry, and I had been informed that if he sent letters, it might include some propaganda — information that the North Vietnamese wanted portrayed. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER I could not dwell on that thought long, as the children were antsy to hear more. I have started daily exercises and am sure that when I am released, I can get a job on TV with an exercise program and be the idol of 1,000,000 American women—what do you think of that? Now that sounds like my Smitty, I thought as I laughed out loud. The children didn’t understand what I was laughing about, but they joined in anyway. I know that Mother, bless her heart, is very upset over my capture. Please help her, and Dad and Mary too, to understand that I am just fine and it is just a matter of time until I am released. Give them my love and tell them I demand that they not worry and that if they do, I will fuss with them when I get home. On a serious vein, Louise—I am convinced that there is a reason for all of this. Perhaps we are being given an opportunity to strengthen our faith to merit some very special graces in the future. Whatever the reason, I am sure we can use this time to become emotionally and spiritually stronger. We are separated, but we still have our love and will have years and years together after I am released. So we are really losing nothing important, and I am sure will gain in other ways. Louise, I know the big responsibilities you suddenly are facing at a time when you are having to take care of the almost constant demands of a new baby. I have absolute faith in your good judgment and your ability to take care of all of this and still maintain your sense of humor and composure, and remain your own lovely, lovely self. I will never understand how I was lucky enough to fall in love with and marry the most wonderful girl in the world. I am addressing this to Tallahassee because I imagine that you will be or are in the States now. My guess is that you will spend some time with both our families and perhaps stay with one until I am released. Later on, you may want to get a place of your own. In any event, please get a maid to help you with the kids and to give you some free time to entertain, go to parties, etc. See how much fun you can have, and I am sure the time will pass quickly until we are together again. I am anxious to hear from you and get all the news about our little boy, also to hear about the latest doings of Robin and Carolyn. You might try regular mail, a peace organization, or a U.S. Senator as a means of getting me a letter. Give Robin and Carolyn a big hug and kiss for me and tell them I love them very much. They are such good and sweet little girls, and their daddy misses them very, very much. I am popping all my buttons with pride over our little boy. Give him an extra hug for me too. Louise, I must repeat, I am in excellent health and spirits. I keep mentally and physically busy so the time passes quickly. In retrospect I am sure this separation will seem short. I love you with every ounce of my heart and soul. Please take care of yourself. All my love, Smitty CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When I finished reading the letter, I refolded it, placed it back in the envelope, and held it close to my heart.

    "articleText": "close Video Andy Puzder: Why the left keeps discounting the Trump economy Democrats and the mainstream media get it wrong yet again. Democrats and the mainstream media keep underestimating the Trump boom. At this point, it’s beginning to seem more like defensiveness than wishful thinking. Again and again, the experts get it wrong. Not unlike the political commentators who have been wishfully predicting “the end of Trump” for the past four years, economic naysayers have been telling us that a “Trump recession” is just around the corner. Clearly, its not. Instead of wallowing in the gloom these experts foretold, investors are riding yet another stock market rally prompted by the latest series of expectation-shattering economic data. The numbers show, once again, that the Left’s dire economic predictions are based largely on an irrational disbelief in the strength of President Trump’s leadership — not sound economics. JUSTIN HASKINS: WARREN HEALTH CARE PLAN WOULD BE A DEVASTATING NATIONAL NIGHTMARE AND HARM ALL AMERICANS Following dire predictions of a recession (two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth), preliminary numbers put third quarter GDP growth at 1.9 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than the estimate from a Dow Jones poll of economists and roughly on par with growth in the previous quarter. The biggest factor the experts overlooked was consumer spending, which grew by an impressive 3.9 percent. Ordinary Americans, it seems, have the confidence in the Trump economy that the experts lack. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed this confidence when it reported that the economy added 128,000 jobs in October. That helped keep the unemployment rate near a 50-year low of 3.6 percent in October, a negligible uptick from the 3.5 percent figure in September and despite the negative impact of 46,000 GM jobs lost due to the 40-day union strike (those jobs will be back in November). And, by the way, the jobs numbers for August and September were revised upward by an additional 95,000 jobs. More from Opinion Donald Trump Jr: Mueller probe was farce by Trump-hating Democrats who want to take my father down Newt Gingrich: Pelosi’s Halloween impeachment vote was an enormous strategic defeat – Let me explain Chuck DeVore: Beto O’Rourke had nothing to offer voters but criticism of Trump The October data proves yet again that Trump is still presiding over the strongest jobs market since the 1960s. The high demand for workers is also driving the fastest wage increases in many years. Average hourly earnings are up 3 percent over the past 12 months, reaching $28.18 per hour. Yearly wage growth has now been at or above 3 percent for 15 consecutive months. That’s means real money for American workers. So the question is, why do people on the Left keep discounting the Trump economy? The president’s opponents are desperate. They’ve been counting on a recession to sweep a left-winger such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders into the White House next year, but time is growing short and there is no evidence of a recession in the near term. It’s been going on too long to simply be a matter of mistaken math. Trump-hating economist Paul Krugman wrote that “We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,” on the day Trump was elected in 2016. In March 2017, The Atlantic insisted that “President Trump still seems likely to face a contraction.” In 2018, “NeverTrump” columnist Quin Hillyer told his readers to ”buy gold, hoard cash, and stock up on good canned foods” before “the likely crash hits (I predict late-October).” Then, this year, we were told multiple times that “inverted yield curves” meant economic catastrophe was imminent. That, too, was a false alarm. Somehow, journalists and economic prognosticators seem to take their own inaccurate predictions as evidence of Trump’s failure, while either denying the very real boom times we’re actually experienced or attributing the strong and growing economy to factors beyond the president’s control. It’s getting absurd – honestly, at this point, let’s label it officially absurd. Even CNN admitted Thursday that this economic expansion could very well continue without interruption for several more years. By now, it’s clear that the president’s opponents are desperate. They’ve been counting on a recession to sweep a left-winger such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders into the White House next year, but time is growing short and there is no evidence of a recession in the near term. This certainly helps explain why congressional Democrats are pursuing impeachment so aggressively despite the utter lack of evidence that Trump did anything wrong. Not to mention the unfathomably remote possibility that, with an election a year away, 20 Republican senators would join 47 Democratic senators to produce the two-thirds majority required to remove a duly elected Republican president – who has done nothing even remotely impeachable – from office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But, with a rock-solid economy generating consistent gains for Americans at all income levels, it’s all they’ve got. There wasn’t a candidate on the stage during the Democratic debate who could beat Trump in a fair election, and the Democrats know it. So, fairness be damned. Let’s face it, the Left’s pessimistic economic predictions are less plausible than ever before. In fact, as the strength of the Trump economy becomes increasingly obvious, their unrealistic impeachment push suggests even the Democrats no longer believe their economic spin. Seriously, with the economic data coming in, they can’t. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDY PUZDER",

The writer of the book of Hebrews communicated to members of the early Christian church, \"Remember the prisoners as if chained with them – those who are mistreated – since you yourselves are in the body also\" ( Hebrews 13:3). GREG LAURIE: KANYE WEST – WELCOME TO THE FAMILY OF GOD AS A FOLLOWER OF JESUS CHRIST Paul, who many believe is the author of Hebrews, was very much aware of the persecution of Christians. Before his conversion to Christ, Paul dedicated his life to tracking down and imprisoning men and women who were followers of the Way. After his Damascus Road experience, the hunter became the hunted, putting his own life on the line many times until he died in Rome. He was beaten with rods at least three times, stoned (with actual stones) once, and imprisoned three times simply because he identified with Jesus Christ and proclaimed the gospel. Today, according to Pew Research, Christians represent the largest segment of people around the world who are targeted and persecuted for their faith. Open Doors estimates that number to be 245 million Christians who are experiencing high levels of persecution for their choice to follow Christ. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER These 245 million people are not just numbers; they are men, women and children, moms, dads, sons and daughters who all have names and share in common the fact they are being arrested, tortured, imprisoned and even killed for one reason – they follow Jesus. One of these 245 million is a teenage girl named Leah Sharibu, who was abducted from a girls' school in Dapchi, Yobe State, Nigeria, by Boko Haram terrorists in February of 2018, along with 109 other girls. More from Opinion Vernon Brewer: Over 245 million Christians are persecuted around the world – Some are being killed Joshua Rogers: God came to me with an incredible idea – and it is now reality Paul Batura: Daylight saving time frenzy – What's so bad about 'falling back,' America? Five girls were killed in the abduction, and the following month, the other girls, except for Leah, were released. Leah remained a captive because she refused to comply with the demands of her Islamic captors that she renounce her faith in Christ and convert to Islam. After threatening to kill her, Boko Haram says they will keep Leah as a \"slave for life.\" Why? Because she is a member of the body of Christ. All of us can hold firm by faith to the truth that our prayers make a difference. Last week I joined Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Capitol Hill for a private prayer gathering for Leah. At that meeting, I had the opportunity to pray with Leah's mother, Rebecca, who has traveled to the United States multiple times in search of help for her daughter. Unfortunately, her pleas for help from the Nigerian government, like the pleas of so many other Christians in that country, have fallen on indifferent ears. As a father of five, I can certainly empathize with Rebecca and ponder what it would be like to walk in her shoes, but as the writer of Hebrews tells us, don't just walk in their shoes; feel their chains and their pain, and do something. No matter our income, health or stage of life, all of us can pray for those who are suffering. Ephesians 6:18 reminds us, “And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.” And all of us can hold firm by faith to the truth that our prayers make a difference. In James 5:16, we read, “The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.” We also can call on our elected officials to be diligent in working for the freedom of those in captivity, reminding them through our letters, social media and meetings, in town halls and wherever possible, that we have not forgotten our brothers and sisters suffering today. It is our duty and necessity to act in the face of evil. Consider the observation of Martin Niemoller, a German who urged his people to unite against the Nazis, with the plea: CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a socialist.“Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist. “Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew. “Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.” Increasingly, in the world today, danger and darkness are lurking for many. We must shine the light brightly, bringing hope and help to those who are in chains for their faith. We must pray and act for them today because tomorrow it could be us.

    "description": "A measure on the Washington state ballot, disguised as pro-diversity, actually threatens to undermine equal opportunity, especially for Asian-American immigrants. It must be defeated.",
    "articleText": "close Video Federal judge says Harvard does not discriminate against Asians Campus Reform correspondent Kelley Babphavong says colleges should be looking at hard work, grit and individualism. We are first-generation immigrants from China living in Washington state. We had no plans for political activism when we arrived in the United States. Yet the potential injustice of politics can be so severe that it compels the most unlikely of us to take a stand. This year, we are leading the campaign to reject the restoration of racial quotas and preferences in our state. In 1998, Washington voters passed a ballot initiative that made it illegal for the state to “discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS BREAKING FROM OBAMA-ERA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES More from Opinion Lindsey Burke, Mary Clare Amselem: Trump’s education budget cuts justified Justin Haskins: Bernie Sanders’ education plan is terrible for minority kids, great for teachers unions This past April, Democrats in the state Legislature overturned the ban. Along with some 300 Asian-Americans, we showed up to the legislative session to voice our opposition getting ride of the ban. Our legislators refused to listen, passing their bill on a straight party-line vote. One state senator even dared us to collect the 200,000 signatures necessary to force the measure, Initiative 1000, to a referendum in this year’s election. We did exactly that and prevented Initiative 1000 from becoming law. Let the people decide, we said, and we put Referendum 88 on the ballot. A “reject” vote means rejecting Initiative1000 and upholding Washington’s existing ban on quotas and preferences. Most of us involved in the \"Let People Vote – Reject Referendum 88\" campaign had never been involved in politics before – never raised money, never collected signatures, never answered questions from reporters, never attended or organized protests and rallies. The impetus for our activism, however, was simple: No one should be racially discriminated against by our government. For us, the principle of equal opportunity is not an abstraction. Most of us immigrated to this country with few resources and few ties to American society. We believed that if we worked hard, we could succeed by merit. We did not ask for handouts or special treatment. In return, America granted us an abundance of opportunities. Our experience taught us that equal opportunity is for everybody. It is not just a slogan; we have lived it, and we believe it deep within our hearts. Yet Initiative 1000 proposes to trash equal opportunity and replace it with discrimination. Though supporters argue that it will expand affirmative action to minorities without quotas and preferences, the initiative actually redefines preferential treatment as applicable only when factors such as race, ethnicity and gender are the “sole qualifying factor” used to confer a public benefit. In other words, the state can freely discriminate when one of these factors is not the only reason for its decision. Of course, whenever race is considered, racial groups are inevitably pitted against each other. For Asian-Americans across the country, we have often borne the cost when the government or elite institutions decide that there are too many of us and not enough of other minorities. Harvard University shows exactly what sordid discrimination schemes can materialize when race is “one factor among many” considered in the admissions process. In a lawsuit brought against Harvard by a coalition of Asian students and parents, the plaintiffs’ research show that an Asian-American applicant with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 35 percent chance if he were white, a 75 percent chance if he were Hispanic, and a 95 percent chance if he were African-American. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Should voters in Washington fail to reject Referendum 88, similarly atrocious practices of discrimination will be coming to our public universities. Currently, Asian-Americans have achieved an admission rate of 27.3 percent at the University of Washington without the use of quotas and preferences, even though they make up only 8.11 percent of the state population. If race is reintroduced as a consideration in the admissions process, UW administrators will eagerly “correct” the overrepresentation of Asian-Americans. Government discrimination will be disguised as the pursuit of diversity. Meanwhile, proponents of quotas and preferences in Washington have shamelessly said Asian- Americans have no business putting our yellow faces on the Reject 88 effort. The racial grievance industry blames us for not falling in line with other minorities and wonders how we dare to have an opinion they did not approve. Such insults and dismissals have only fueled our motivation to fight back. In the land of the free, everybody deserves to be treated equally. We will not meekly stand by while politicians and special interests decide to treat us as political nobodies in order to further their sanctimony, self-interest or hypocrisy. Through the Reject 88 campaign, many members of our community have come to a political awakening. We have found our voices, we are not backing down, and we are not asking for permission to fight for what is right. We do not have much time on this issue, however. Voting by mail began in Washington state is already underway and will continue until Tuesday, Election Day. (Washington does not have in-person voting). We are being vastly outspent by the other side, which is supported by unions and corporate interests eager to appease identity politics, and managed by operatives steeped in years of grievance peddling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We hope Washingtonians will stand with us to reject Referendum 88, and Americans from around the country will extend us their moral and financial support. We hope equal opportunity will once again prevail in Washington state. Kan Qiu is co-chair of the Let People Vote – Reject Referendum 88 campaign and a small business owner in Washington state.",

    "articleText": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 5 Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 5 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Tuesday that it is unlikely that President Trump would be convicted and removed from office is he were to face a Senate impeachment trial today. McConnell appeared confident given the knowledge he has that if the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach Trump, the president will not be found guilty in his trial before the Senate. “I will say I’m pretty sure how it’s likely to end,” McConnell told reporters in Washington. “If it were today, I don’t think there’s any question it would not lead to a removal.” NEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED It takes two-thirds of the Senate to convict a president and remove him from office. That means at least 20 Republicans would have to vote to convict Trump if he is impeached by the Democrat-controlled House. McConnell also questioned whether the six Democratic senators currently running for president in 2020 would want to take time off from campaigning to attend what could be a lengthy trial in the Senate. “The question is how long the Senate wants to take,” he said. “How long do the presidential candidates want to be here on the floor of the Senate instead of Iowa and New Hampshire?” Video McConnell added: “It’s very difficult to ascertain how long this takes. I’d be surprised if it didn’t end the way the two previous ones did, with the president not being removed from office,” Neither of the last two presidents to face impeachment – Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton – were removed from office. Nixon resigned from office before he could face impeachment, while Clinton was impeached by the House but was acquitted by the Senate. McConnell’s comments came as House Democrats released hundreds of pages of testimony from two top diplomats: Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both testified for hours behind closed doors about Trump's interest in having Ukraine pursue investigations of Joe Biden and Democrats. The push came as the White House was holding onto millions of dollars in military aid to the East European ally. Video Democrats claim that's an improper quid pro quo, while Trump and his GOP allies insist the president did nothing wrong. The two diplomats were part of a pivotal May meeting with Trump at the White House that raised red flags. They also engaged in a text message chain about the administration's actions toward Ukraine.

    "articleText": "close Video New Hampshire's undeclared voters could become 'silent majority' in Dem primary The first-in-the-nation primary could be decided by independent or undeclared voters fed up with partisan politics, some argue. MANCHESTER, N.H. – They say they're fed up with the partisan dysfunction in Washington – and their votes could be pivotal for Democratic hopefuls. About 1,500 independent, moderate, and undeclared voters converged on the Problem Solver Convention on Sunday in Manchester, N.H. – with the first-in-the-nation primary a little over three months away. About 42 percent – a plurality of New Hampshire voters – are registered as undeclared, according to the New Hampshire Secretary of State's voter rolls. Under the state's rules, undeclared voters can choose to vote in either party's primary – meaning there's a potential for a different kind of February surprise. \"There's really a silent majority of people out there who are not partisan and really are yearning for people in Washington to get together,\" said former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who was a Democrat before becoming an independent during his last term in office. Lieberman, who helped organize the convention as chairman of the organization No Labels, said he is now a registered Democrat. NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY GETS REAL AS CANDIDATES FLOCK TO FILE BEFORE DEADLINE In the 2016 campaign, President Trump gave a stump speech at the Problem Solver Convention. This cycle, presidential candidates Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, John Delaney, and Republican Bill Weld made their pitch to voters. \"Year after year, it gets worse and less gets done,\" Gabbard said of the partisan gridlock in D.C. \"It's more about which party can angle the best to take back more seats in the next election.\" Lieberman said as a registered Democrat, he's concerned about how the primary race has shifted the party further to the left – adding that the ongoing impeachment inquiry will only serve to intensify bitter political divisions. \"In the middle of an already partisan, divided, unproductive political system,\" Lieberman said, \"it's only going to make it worse.\" Moderate voters at the convention seemed to agree – pushing both parties to work together to find common ground. PARTISAN DYSFUNCTION DRIVES DEMAND FOR NEW CHOICE \"It's extreme left on the Democratic side and extreme right on the Republican side,\" said Ken Tentarelli, a longtime independent voter from Newbury, N.H. \"Unfortunately, the middle doesn't really have much of a voice.\" Lieberman thinks the primary contest could change that. \"Independent voters are going to the [Democratic] primary,\" Lieberman said. \"I think they're going to determine who wins.\" But Professor Andrew Smith, a pollster at the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, doesn't think there really is such a thing as an independent voter in this hyperpartisan day in age. \"The truth is the independents in New Hampshire are a myth,\" Smith said. \"There aren't anymore independent or independent-minded voters than there are in any other state in the country.\" Indeed, the data shows that most undeclared do consistently vote either Republican or Democrat, Smith said. \"You can't rely on those undeclared or independent voters here to win the primary. Nobody's done that,\" Smith said. \"Factions and parties want to motivate their bases in primaries.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Come next November, none of the independent voters Fox News spoke to could see themselves voting for a third-party candidate. \"I'm not going to go for a third-party candidate,\" said New Hampshire moderate voter Frank Stama. \"That's just the way to dilute your vote.

    "description": "He’s not on the ballot, but President Trump is on the minds of voters casting ballots in state-level elections across the country on Tuesday.",
    "articleText": "close Video President Trump campaigns for GOP gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin in Kentucky Fox News correspondent Todd Piro reports. He’s not on the ballot, but President Trump is on the minds of voters casting ballots in state-level elections across the country on Tuesday. And the president – one year out from his own reelection – is hoping that he can still work his electoral magic in three deeply red Southern states that he won big in the 2016 presidential election. “Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message,” Trump declared during a rally on Tuesday night in Lexington. “You will vote to reject the Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who's done a great job.” Video Bevin’s facing an extremely challenging reelection battle against Democratic challenger and bitter rival Andy Beshear, the state’s attorney general. Besides Kentucky, there’s a nail-biting gubernatorial contest on Tuesday in Mississippi and a race that’s up for grabs in Louisiana on Nov. 16. The three conservative states – which also have a tradition of electing Democratic governors -- will be the first key electoral tests since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against the Republican president. And the results of the showdowns could serve as a barometer for whether Trump still has the ability to rally Republicans at the voting booth. On Friday, Trump traveled to Mississippi to stand with Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who’s locked in a very close contest with Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood. Video Taking aim at the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Trump argued that Hood \"fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. That's not the kind of guy we need here.\" On Wednesday, he heads to Louisiana. “LOUISIANA! Extreme Democrat John Bel Edwards has sided with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to support Sanctuary Cities, High Taxes, and Open Borders,” Trump tweeted on Friday. The president was blasting Louisiana’s Democratic incumbent governor, who was forced into a runoff against Republican businessman Eddie Rispone in last month’s nonpartisan primary election after ultimately failing to win a majority. Of all three states, Trump’s presence may make the most difference in Kentucky, where only two of the last 10 governors have been Republicans. Bevin’s first term has been anything but tranquil. He battled state lawmakers from his own party and even had a spat with his lieutenant governor. And he faced three primary challengers, winning renomination by getting just 52 percent of the primary vote. “If Governor Bevin loses, he will have no one to blame but himself. His propensity to attack anyone who disagrees with him aligns him with Trump, but he doesn’t necessarily get the same pass from voters,” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the Cook Report, a nonpartisan political handicapper. The Kentucky governor – one of the most unpopular in the nation -- talks about Trump often on the campaign trail and prominently features the president in his TV commercials. And he’s repeatedly defended Trump against the House impeachment inquiry. “Bevin wants to be bailed out by President Trump, who won the state by a mile in 2016, and it seems like he is bringing up impeachment about every chance he can get,” highlighted Fox News’ anchor and chief national correspondent Ed Henry. “The point is this race may give us our first real test of whether using impeachment as a weapon is actually more fruitful for Republicans than Democrats, in terms of rallying the conservative base,” Henry explained. “And given Bevin’s troubles back home, it will be a real barometer of whether the president still has coattails in MAGA country, just as we saw him pull a Republican across the finish line in that special House election in North Carolina.” In Louisiana, Edwards is hoping to repeat his 2015 success, when he topped then-Republican Sen. David Vitter in the runoff. But Louisiana, like many other socially conservative states, continues to trend red as once reliably Democratic voters increasingly cast ballots for GOP candidates. “Gov. John Bel Edwards has to be nervous that while impeachment itself is not front and center in his race, the deep political divide may be firing up Trump voters in the rural areas of the state where the incumbent has to make some inroads in order to survive,” Henry noted. “Edwards still seems to have a slight edge, but the whole reason he was forced into a runoff is that the president came to the state and got his voters to the polls. That kept Edwards under the 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff.” But Trump's name isn't on the ballot. And these aren't federal elections. Leah Askarinam, a reporter and analyst with the nonpartisan newsletter Inside Elections, noted that even in these increasingly partisan times, voters might be “willing to cross party lines when it comes to governance of their specific states.” “Gubernatorial candidates can campaign on issues that are state-specific like the state's budget and education funding -- and they can cross party lines without facing the same kind of political pressure as Senate candidates who have to work with a national legislature,” Askarinam said. “We've seen candidates like John Bel Edwards support state policies that limit abortion access, for example, which is a much more difficult stance to take as a Democrat in the Senate.” While Trump – and impeachment – may be making headlines as these off-year elections play out, Duffy emphasized: “I don’t necessarily believe that the outcome of this year’s governors’ races will tell us much about next year.” Specifically in Louisiana, she said that if Edwards loses, “it tells me that the state has become intractable red as Edwards doesn’t have strong vulnerabilities apart from being a Democrat.” And in Mississippi, she noted that Hood “has been running statewide successfully for years. In one ad, he says something along the lines of 'I drive my own truck, carry my own gun and bait my own hook.'\"",

Matt Bevin a Trumpian endorsement Monday night, just hours before Kentuckians go to the polls to decide if they’ll elect the Republican governor to a second term. ‘He’s such a pain in the ass,’ Trump said of Bevin. ‘But isn’t that what you want?’ It was a backhanded compliment meant to highlight how hard Bevin works for Kentucky, but it also called attention to the governor’s biggest political weakness: his penchant for making controversial remarks that alienate friends and foes alike. … The event, though, has huge importance for Bevin, who is locked in a tight race with Democrat Andy Beshear, the attorney general. Bevin has tied himself tightly to the president as he attempts to win back support after waging a public battle with teachers over their pension system.” Unusually close race in Mississippi - AP: “Mississippi’s most competitive governor’s race in years was in the hands of voters Tuesday as Attorney General Jim Hood sought to become the second Democratic governor in the Deep South. He’s facing Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who got campaign help in Mississippi from both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Hood, Reeves and two lesser-known candidates are on Tuesday’s ballot. The winner will succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. Democrats see Hood as their strongest nominee in nearly a generation in a conservative state where Republicans have been governor for 24 of the past 28 years.” Republican majorities on the line in Old Dominion - WTOP: “Virginians are going to the polls Tuesday to cast votes in local elections as well as General Assembly races that could change the composition of both chambers of the state’s legislature, while several D.C.-area towns in Maryland hold elections for mayor and council. In Virginia, the Republicans control both houses by the narrowest of margins. They hold a 21-19 advantage in the Senate and a 51-49 margin in the House of Delegates — that last only after a random drawing decided a tied election in District 94. These General Assembly elections will be the only ones conducted using the district maps chosen by a panel of federal judges in January, after ruling last year that lawmakers had racially gerrymandered 11 House districts by packing black voters into them.” THE RULEBOOK: BETTER NOT “Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 23 TIME OUT: ‘TOO MODERN FOR ITS TIME’ Atlantic: “Karolina Pavlova, born in 1807, wasn’t a woman who acted in accordance with social norms. The leader of a respected Moscow literary salon, she was also devoutly committed to her own writing. That trait was greeted with animosity from many of her male contemporaries, who disparaged her readiness to share her work as unwomanly and approached her soaringly emotive poetry with suspicion. Even so, Pavlova’s novel A Double Life shook the Russian literary world when it was published in 1848, earning widespread praise for its revolutionary form and psychological acuity. Pavlova had written a book depicting a woman’s struggle against social constraints, and—a full half century before Freud popularized the idea of the subconscious—insisting on the independence of the unconscious mind. …Barbara Heldt [translated] and released [a new edition] this year… Pavlova constructed a strikingly prescient psychological vision: a mind responding to extreme social pressure by slowly and completely separating itself into parts, but giving few external indications of change.” Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.

POLL: BIDEN WIDENS LEAD OVER TRUMP, NOW 17 POINTS WaPo: “One year out from the 2020 election, President Trump trails some potential Democratic rivals in head-to-head matchups, with his national support level currently fixed at about 40 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. … Among the 39 percent of registered voters who approve of Trump’s job performance, Trump is winning at least 95 percent support against each of five possible Democratic opponents. But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent support. Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent). South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up by 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead by 51 percent to 42 percent.” Castro gives up on New Hampshire and South Carolina - Politico: “Julián Castro’s campaign will fire its staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, an official familiar with the campaign told POLITICO. The campaign notified the state teams on Monday and their final day will be next week. The source said the campaign will continue focusing on Iowa and Nevada with a $50,000 television ad buy in Iowa beginning Tuesday morning. The moves amount to a long-shot attempt to remain in the presidential contest in the hopes of catching fire before the first contests begin next February. Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Barack Obama, has had success in framing — and, in some cases, starting — the Democratic primary’s policy debates but has struggled to raise money or raise his poll numbers above low single digits. Asked for comment, the Castro campaign pointed POLITICO to its statement last week when news of an Iowa-Nevada focus first surfaced.” Buttigieg adjusts campaign to utilize the moment - WaPo: “What is going on is Buttigieg seizing an opening in the Democratic presidential field, pushing his way into the gap between liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the more moderate former vice president Joe Biden. ‘The way we think this shapes up is, if you want the most ideological, far-out candidate possible, you’ve got your answer. You want the most Washington candidate possible, you’ve got your answer,’ Buttigieg said Saturday from his campaign bus in Iowa. … That positioning represents a significant shift from Buttigieg’s posture when he entered the race. Buttigieg made early headlines by portraying himself as the vanguard of generational change, a 37-year-old seeking to become the first openly gay president and talking up big liberal ideas, like abolishing the electoral college and restructuring the Supreme Court. While his campaign says he still supports those policies, he rarely mentions them on the campaign trail these days.” Harris’ long, hard fall - Politico: “Interviews with more than 50 people inside and around [Kamala Harris’] campaign … reveal how a candidate with so much promise, range and charisma has slid so far. Many of her dilemmas are self-creations. Harris undermined her national introduction with costly flubs on health care, feeding a critique that she lacks a strong ideological core and plays to opinion polls and the desires of rich donors. She was vague or noncommittal on question after question from voters at campaign stops. She leaned on verbal crutches instead of hammering her main points in high-profile TV moments. The deliberate, evidence-intensive way she arrives at decisions—one of her potential strengths in a matchup with Trump—often made her look wobbly and unprepared. … Her prospects look grim. Once-optimistic forecasts from her aides now diverge into complaints about biased treatment from the news media, some of them valid. But Harris has also struggled to figure out how to embrace her own record.” Swingers, 2020 edition - NYT: “They are similar in holding ideologically inconsistent views, but they otherwise span all walks of life, based on an analysis of 569 respondents to recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys in the six closest states carried by the president in the 2016 presidential election. These voters represent 15 percent of the electorate in the battleground states, and they say there’s a chance they’ll vote for either Mr. Trump or the Democrat. … The poll adds a new mix of characters to the quadrennial cast of swing voters, like a somewhat conservative, college-educated suburban man who does not approve of the president’s performance, but strongly opposes a single-payer health system. … For now, these persuadable voters in battleground states have a favorable view of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but not of Elizabeth Warren, our polling shows.” Team Obama makes show of support for cash-strapped Biden - Politico: “More than 30 high-ranking Obama administration officials are hosting a Wednesday soiree for Joe Biden intended to be equal parts fundraiser and public show of support for the former vice president’s 2020 campaign. The event is taking place at the home of ex-National Economic Council director Jeff Zients and his wife, Mary, as Biden hustles to raise money before primary voting begins. Biden's fundraising flagged during the most recent quarter, but Zients and others are also trying to send a message beyond the money chase, according to people familiar with the event planning. They want to show that while some Obama allies may have drifted toward candidates newer to the national political scene, including Pete Buttigieg, Biden still has support from many of his former administration colleagues.” Steyer aide out after swiping Harris volunteer data - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “A South Carolina aide for Tom Steyer’s 2020 presidential campaign stole valuable volunteer data collected by Kamala Harris’ campaign using an account from when he worked with the S.C. Democratic Party, according to multiple state and national party officials. The Steyer campaign said that it does not have possession of the data and that Democratic officials were only aware of the download, which they said was inadvertent, because they proactively notified them. Both the Democratic National Committee and S.C. Democratic Party denied that. The Democratic National Committee said they quickly caught the attempt on Friday by Steyer’s deputy S.C. state director Dwane Sims to export Harris’ data, which contained thousands of volunteer contacts collected over the course of the campaign in this critical early-voting primary state.” Nathan Gonzales: A year out, here's four scenarios for 2020 elections - Roll Call: “Even though predicting anything to do with Trump might seem like a risk because of how typically damaging stories don’t seem to impact his standing, the president is a historically unpopular figure whose job approval rating has been static for months. … Trump remains incredibly popular with the Republican base, however, and the GOP has transitioned to primarily embracing a person more than a conservative ideology. That could eventually create a messy transition of power, but for now, it gives the president a high electoral floor as Republicans rally to his cause. … Following are four scenarios, in order of their likelihood: Scenario 1: Eviction at 1600 … Scenario 2: Blue Washington … Scenario 3: Status Quo … Scenario 4: Red Revival.” KEY WITNESS REVERSES TESTIMONY, ADMITS QUID PRO QUO NYT: “A critical witness in the impeachment inquiry offered Congress substantial new testimony this week, revealing that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country likely would not receive American military aid unless it publicly committed to investigations President Trump wanted. The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in four new pages of sworn testimony released on Tuesday, confirmed his involvement in essentially laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that he had previously not acknowledged. The testimony offered several major new details beyond the account he gave the inquiry in a 10-hour interview last month. Mr. Sondland provided a more robust description of his own role in alerting the Ukrainians that they needed to go along with investigative requests being demanded by the president’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.” Transcripts suggest GOP lacks impeachment strategy - WaPo: “Republicans have complained for weeks about the secret House impeachment inquiry… But inside the secure room in the Capitol basement where the proceedings are taking place, Republicans have used their time to complain that testimony has become public, going after their colleagues who were quoted in media reports commenting on witness appearances, and quizzing witnesses themselves on how their statements had been released. The efforts by GOP lawmakers to shape the Democrats’ inquiry emerged in full view for the first time Monday with the release of hundreds of pages of transcripts from two early witnesses: Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. … But the newly released transcripts from Yovanovitch and McKinley — who appeared on Oct. 11 and Oct. 16, respectively — underscore how the Republicans’ strategy at that relatively early stage in the deposition process was more scattershot, covering a range of topics.” PLAY-BY-PLAY United States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal - Fox News RNC paid $60,000 for Trump and entourage to watch cage-fighting - WaPo California drives out conservatives to ‘redder pastures’ - LAT Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., faces ethics probe over financial disclosure - Politico AUDIBLE: LIKE VERDUN, BUT FOR POLITICS “These results suggest that the partisan tribes on both sides are digging in as the impeachment spotlight intensifies.” – Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, discussing the results of Monmouth’s latest poll released Tuesday. FROM THE BLEACHERS “I’m a huge Fox News fan. Why did Fox use 19% more Democrats in its poll than Republicans. I saw the break down at a conservative web site. Am I wrong?” – Dick Alexander, Pickerington, Ohio [Ed. note: Somebody sold you a bum steer, I’m afraid, Mr. Alexander. In our most recent poll, 49 percent of respondents identified themselves as Democrats, 41 percent identified themselves as Republicans and 11 percent identified themselves as independents. Our numbers for both parties are higher than in other polls because our questionnaire gives respondents of being strong partisans, weak partisans or independents. Others, like this week’s WaPo/ABC News poll, force subjects to choose among just three options. But the result is about the same: a six-point edge for Democrats. In the WSJ/NBC News poll out this week, pollsters gave respondents seven (!) options on a partisanship scale, but the net effect is the same: Republicans trailed Democrats by 8 points. Those advantages for Democrats have been pretty consistent in recent years and over the history of public opinion polling. Certainly exit polls and our Fox News Voter Analysis consistently show that Democrats outnumber Republicans in elections. That’s why Republicans rely so much on independent and loosely affiliated voters to win elections. If the GOP starts doing better going into 2020, I would expect to see more independents expressing solidarity for the Red Team. But we’ll continue to track partisan affiliation in part because it provides valuable insight on how persuadable voters are moving. And you never need to trust the dubious analysis of others for whose being surveyed for our polls. We publish all the results for everyone to see.] “I am hoping that someday people will stop calling the Democrat Party the ‘Democratic’ Party.” – Jim King, Chesapeake, Va. [Ed. note: I’m always a little mystified about why so many Republicans harp on this subject. I never hear Democrats say that the other side should be called the Republic Party. As far as I can tell, the values of the Democratic Party are in line with the name. The party is generally (and increasingly) opposed to many limits on democracy. The Electoral College, disproportionate Senate representation, lifetime Supreme Court appointments and other small-r republican institutions are quite unpopular among progressives. More direct democracy, including low-to-zero barrier to ballot access, seems to be a top goal for many in the party. I also see some anti-republican trends among Republicans, particularly as it relates to a disregard bordering on disdain for the power of the legislative branch and a monarchical bent toward presidential power. But I think, generally, the parties are still in the respective lanes suggested by their names. But most of all, why wouldn’t you call people by the name they prefer? That just seems like good manners. And I certainly don’t know how you would ever bring someone around to your point of view on any subject if you start out with what is essentially an insult.] “In the article about the President’s taxes, it states that the NY state prosecutors are investigating the hush money payments made to two women. What is the difference between those payments and NDA’s that many corporations use to prevent women from talking? Just wondering.” – Phillip H. Nawrocki, Mesa, Ariz. [Ed. note: It’s legal to pay people to be quiet. But if you pay people to be quiet for the purposes of winning an election, you have to disclose that as a campaign expense. The problem for prosecutors in New York is that it will be extremely hard to prove that’s why Trump paid the hush money. As his lawyers have argued in the past, he had ample reasons to cover up his relationships with a sex worker and a nude model – hush money he would have paid whether he was running for office or not. There are some additional considerations about hiding income, etc., but it still seems like a tough case to make. It shouldn’t be hard to convince a jury that a man would pay money to keep the knowledge hidden that he was having sex with a pornographic performer while his wife was convalescing from childbirth.

BEEP, BEEP WGHP: “A Louisiana man was arrested after stealing an electric-powered shopping cart from Walmart to avoid getting a DWI, police said. Brice Kendell Williams, 32, was charged with felony unauthorized use of a moveable after driving the motorized shopping cart over half a mile away from one bar to another, according to the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office. … A deputy with the sheriff’s office responded to a bar in Houma, Louisiana, around 12:30 a.m. Sunday after receiving a complaint about someone arriving to a bar in a shopping cart, according to the statement. The town is about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans. When the deputy arrived, he found the shopping cart parked between two cars in the bar’s parking lot. Williams told the responding deputy that he was at a different bar and thought that if he drove his car, he could get charged with a DWI, the sheriff’s office said. Instead, Williams opted to steal the electric shopping cart, which is meant for disabled people, and drive it to a different bar, the sheriff’s office said.” AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES… “The Republican problem today is that both ideas are dead.

    "description": "House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump have requested that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appear before the panels for a deposition on Friday, claiming that he was “directly involved” in the Ukraine controversy which sparked the proceedings.",
    "articleText": "close Video Mick Mulvaney insists Ukraine aid was not held up for political reasons Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says aid was withheld due to concerns of corruption in Ukraine and concerns that European nations weren't contributing their fair share; Kristin Fisher reports. House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump have requested that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appear before the panels for a deposition on Friday, claiming that he was “directly involved” in the Ukraine controversy which sparked the proceedings. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel penned a letter to Mulvaney on Tuesday, requesting his appearance at a deposition as part of the impeachment inquiry this Friday at 9 a.m. NEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED “Based on evidence gathered in the impeachment inquiry and public reporting, we believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House’s impeachment inquiry,” they wrote. The White House appeared to reject the request Tuesday. \"Past Democrat and Republican administrations would not be inclined to permit senior advisers to the president to participate in such a ridiculous, partisan, illegitimate proceeding – and neither is this one,” White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters. The request for Mulvaney’s deposition comes amid the House’s formal impeachment inquiry into the president. The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld. “Specifically, the investigation has revealed that you may have been directly involved in an effort orchestrated by President Trump, his personal agent, Rudolph Giuliani, and others to withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trump’s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so,” the Democrats said in their letter. A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion. In the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced “evidence,” such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaney’s role in Trump’s conversations with Zelensky. “…Bolton told a National Security Council staffer ‘to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaney’ to pressure Ukraine for political help,” they wrote. “Ambassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the President’s scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, ‘I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,’” they wrote. “The ‘drug deal’ appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.” The chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing “a central role” in the president’s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month. “You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the President’s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,” they wrote. During a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White House’s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points. “We do that all the time with foreign policy,” Mulvaney said. “And I have news for everybody: Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.” Mulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday. “Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trump’s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the President’s 2020 re-election campaign,” they wrote. It is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

    "description": "Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, according to transcripts released Tuesday, pushed back on the claim that President Trump sought to withhold a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Kiev committed to investigate allegations concerning the 2016 election -- while also denying that Trump was seeking “dirt” on former Vice President Joe Biden.",
    "articleText": "close Video House investigators release excerpts of Volker, Sondland transcripts from impeachment inquiry Democrats release hundreds of pages of testimony from Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, according to transcripts released Tuesday, pushed back on the claim that President Trump sought to withhold a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Kiev committed to investigate allegations concerning the 2016 election -- while also denying that Trump was seeking “dirt” on former Vice President Joe Biden. The deposition transcripts, though, also reflect officials' concerns about the involvement of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in seeking politically related investigations out of Ukraine. Further, they offer varying accounts of whether a quid pro quo of some kind -- involving either a meeting or the release of U.S. military aid -- may have been presented. One of the most significant revelations from Tuesday's release is that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement -- a revelation that was quickly hailed by Democrats of proof of the quid pro quo they have been alleging took place. Other sections presented a muddier picture. In the transcript of his closed-door deposition last month with lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe, Volker was asked if Trump withheld or delayed a meeting with Zelensky absent a pledge to probe concerns Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. GIULIANI SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE DEMS FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY “The answer to the question is no, if you want a yes-or-no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did have difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no linkage like that,” he said. Recently revealed text messages showed Volker appearing to link the investigations to a D.C. visit by Zelensky. The deposition transcript seems to reflect Volker asserting the contrary. Sondland, too, testifying about a conversation he had with White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, said he didn't tell him the investigations were needed in order for there to be a White House visit. Video \"That was never linked,\" he said. \"That was only specifically brought into the press statement for a brief period of time through Mr. Giuliani when we were negotiating a press statement.\" At another point in the transcript, though, Sondland said he eventually thought \"there might be a link between the White House visit and aid to the Ukraine that was being held up.\" House Democrats established the impeachment inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged him to “look into” allegations surrounding the 2016 election and the Biden family’s activities in the country. Democrats have alleged that a quid pro quo took place, with Trump leveraging military aid until the Ukrainians investigated the claims. Trump and Zelensky have claimed that no pressure was placed on them, but statements from certain officials have challenged that narrative. While the White House released the transcript of the call, and a House committee released the original complaint by the whistleblower that sparked the process, much of the inquiry is now focusing on what officials understood to be the president’s intent at the time. While military aid was initially locked, it was eventually unblocked by Congress. Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor recently testified that he understood the White House was willing to hold up both military aid and a prospective White House meeting to extract a public announcement from the country that probes were underway. US ENVOY SONDLAND WORKED WITH GIULIANI ON UKRAINE CORRUPTION STATEMENT, VOLKER TESTIFIED: SOURCES “By mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,” Taylor testified, referring to Burisma Holdings -- a Ukrainian energy firm where Joe Biden’s son Hunter sat on the board. A transcript of the July call shows Trump sought an investigation concerning Joe Biden’s involvement in seeking the ouster of a prosecutor looking into that firm. Video Yet while Sondland had texted Taylor in September saying there was no quid pro quo, the transcripts released Tuesday of his deposition include a supplemental declaration, in which he says that “by the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.” He also acknowledged telling one of Zelensky’s advisers that “resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham still said the transcripts show less evidence for the \"illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought.\" She noted that Sondland said he \"presumed\" there was a link to the aid—\"but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption.\" In another excerpt from the testimony, Sondland described how the discussions about a statement on corruption in general in Ukraine became more explicitly about Biden-Burisma as a \"continuum\" amid the involvement of Giuliani, who was pushing the Biden-Burisma agenda. \"It kept—it kept getting more insidious as [the] timeline went on, and back in July, it was all about just corruption,\" he said. Separately he told lawmakers that Trump repeatedly urged Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to talk to Giuliani. \"He didn’t even -- he wasn’t even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: 'Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,'\" he said. Volker too spoke about Giuliani's involvement, telling lawmakers that \"the negative narrative about Ukraine which Mr. Giuliani was furthering was the problem.\" Democrats seized on the testimony as proof of a quid pro quo, saying it was a sign that \"the president's scheme comes into clearer focus.\" “It is clear from their testimony that, in exchange for the statement, President Trump would award the Ukrainian president with a highly coveted White House meeting and, later, with millions of dollars in critical military aid being withheld,\" the statement from the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees said. \"Ambassador Sondland called this changing U.S. policy toward Ukraine a ‘continuum’ that became ever more ‘insidious’ over time.\" DIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WHITE HOUSE MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES The statement from Sondland contrasts with his texts with Taylor, who had expressed concern about what he saw as a quid pro quo. \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said in a text exchange in September. “The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind,” Sondland texted back. “The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.” Sondland, though, explained to the committees that Trump said something similar to him during a phone call, in which he said Trump was in a \"bad mood\" and nearly hung up on him. \"I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,\" Trump said, according to Sondland. \"I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\" Volker, meanwhile, on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, seemed to link a White House visit with the investigations, despite his more recent testimony.

And I think there’s a difference between the manufacture or dig up dirt versus finding out did anything happen in the 2016 campaign or did anything happen with Burisma. I think – or even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something.” On the question of the hold placed on aid, he said it struck him as \"unusual\" but that \"no reason was ever given as to why that was.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When Volker testified last month, Republicans said his testimony did not comport with what they called “Democrats’ impeachment narrative.” Meanwhile, two witnesses were scheduled to give depositions on Tuesday, but didn’t show up to the House Intelligence Committee.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com A dozen bottles of fine French wine arrived at the space station Monday, not for the astronauts, but for science. The red Bordeaux wine will age for a year up there before returning to Earth. Researchers will study how weightlessness and space radiation affect the aging process. The goal is to develop new flavors and properties for the food industry. The bottles flew up aboard a Northrop Grumman capsule that launched from Virginia on Saturday and arrived at the International Space Station on Monday. Each bottle was packed in a metal canister to prevent breakage. Universities in Bordeaux, France, and Bavaria, Germany, are taking part in the experiment from Space Cargo Unlimited, a Luxembourg startup. Winemaking uses both yeast and bacteria, and involves chemical processes, making wine ideal for space study, said University of Erlangen-Nuremberg’s Michael Lebert, the experiment’s scientific director, in a company video.

(AP) The space-aged wine will be compared to Bordeaux wine aged on Earth. What’s left will go to those who helped pay for the research, according to a company spokeswoman. This is the first of six space missions planned by the company over the next three years touching on the future of agriculture given our changing world. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure,” Nicolas Gaume, chief executive and co-founder of Space Cargo Unlimited, said in a statement.

The insane insects, which have been trapped \"for years,\" have resorted to eating the corpses of their dead brethren to survive.

The abstract added that the \"imprisoned ants\" used an \"experimentally installed boardwalk\" to get through the ventilation pipe to get to their nest on the top of the bunker. Given the bunker's location and the lack of available food sources, researchers concluded that the surviving ants had resorted to cannibalism to survive. \"It is known that wood ants consume dead bodies of their conspecifics left in masses on the ground during spectacular ‘ant wars’ early in the season,\" the authors wrote in the study. \"The function of such wars is to settle the borders of neighboring conspecific colonies, but the corpses also add substantially to the scarce food resources available when the colony lives commence after winter.\" 'CRYPT-KEEPER' WASP ABLE TO CONTROL THE MINDS OF ITS VICTIMS It's also believed that the ants are part of a larger colony that lives in the soil around the bunker. In spring 2016, the researchers took a group of approximately 100 ants from the bunker and introduced them to the larger colony to see how they would interact. \"As expected, no aggressive behavior was observed,\" the authors added. Despite the presence of the makeshift boardwalk and the fact that the ants seemed to be accepted back into the larger colony, the researchers found that there is still a group of ants that choose to remain in the bunker.

    "articleText": "A group of researchers used a CT scan to examine the insides of this ancient Egyptian cat mummy held at the Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes in France. (Credit: Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes) Scans of an ancient cat mummy revealed that the 2,500-year-old feline supposedly resting within the wrappings wasn't a single animal. Instead, the mummy held the partial remains of three cats, according to new findings. Ancient Egyptian cat mummies aren't uncommon, and archaeologists have previously found tens of cat mummies in burials. In ancient Egypt, pets were commonly buried with their owners. The desire to preserve animals as offerings to the gods led to the establishment of an entire industry and the mummification of over 70 million animals, according to a previous Live Science report. A group of researchers recently analyzed the 2,500-year-old Egyptian cat mummy that was part of a collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Rennes, France. The scientists performed a computerized tomography (CT) scan, a type of X-ray, to illuminate what was inside the mummy without unwrapping it, and then they created 3D digital and transparent 3D-printed reconstructions of the mummy. Related: Images: Ancient Egyptian Kittens The scans revealed that this ancient mummy was filled with some surprises. Instead of the cat's head, the mummy held a ball of fabric. It was also missing a skull, vertebrae and ribs, and instead held five hind leg bones from three different cats, according to a statement from the National Institute of Preventive Archeological Research (Inrap) in France. The bones were decomposed and riddled with holes created by corpse-eating insects, said Théophane Nicolas, a researcher at Inrap who was part of the project. \"Cat mummies have been found in very large quantities sometimes in extremely degraded states and reduced to the state of accumulation of bones,\" Nicolas told Live Science. But sometimes what you see on the outside is not what you get on the inside, he said. While some animal mummies are complete, others are empty or have only fragments of animal bones. What's more, because the larger mummies preserved as offerings for the gods sold for more money, many of the mummies were made to appear bigger than the animals themselves, and some didn't contain animal remains at all. Instead, they were filled with organic material such as leather and gravel, according to the previous Live Science report. It's unclear why the Rennes cat mummy held the partial remains of three different cats, but some researchers believe that it was part of an \"ancient scam organized by unscrupulous priests,\" Nicolas said in the statement. Priests could have \"resorted to less elaborate preparations, impossible to detect by sight\" for rituals which \"gradually lead to mummies whose cat shape represents a visible reality beyond the real content,\" he told Live Science. But Nicolas and his team don't think that's necessarily true. \"We believe on the contrary that there are innumerable ways to make animal mummies,\" he said in the statement. The group of scientists projected the internal 3D reconstruction onto the 3D-printed model of the mummy. This glowing object was presented last month in Sweden at the European Heritage Days 2019 event and will be on display for people to view at the Museum of Fine Arts in France.

Known as 2006 SF6, the space rock will zip past Earth on Nov. 20 at approximately 2.7 million miles (0.02886 astronomical units) at roughly 12:01 a.m. EDT, according to NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies, which tracks near-Earth objects. According to a 2018 report put together by Planetary.org, there are more than 18,000 NEOs.

Asteroid 2006 SF6, which was discovered on Sept. 17, 2006, is believed to be between 919 feet and 2,034 feet in diameter, slightly smaller than the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, S.D., the tallest structure in the U.S. and fourth tallest in the world. The space rock will fly past Earth at approximately 17,800 miles per hour and will come within close proximity to our planet again on Nov. 5, 2020, two days after the U.S. presidential election. In August, an asteroid slightly shorter than the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, flew past Earth. NASA has been preparing for planetary defense from asteroid strikes for years. A recent survey showed that Americans prefer a space program that focuses on potential asteroid impacts over sending humans back to the Moon or to Mars. 2016 saw NASA formalize its prior program for detecting and tracking NEOs and put it inside its Science Mission Directorate. Last June, the space agency unveiled a 20-page plan that detailed the steps the U.S. should take to be better prepared for NEOs – such as asteroids and comets – that come within 30 million miles of the planet.

Separately in April, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said that an asteroid strike is not something to be taken lightly and is perhaps Earth's biggest threat. \"We have to make sure that people understand that this is not about Hollywood, it's not about movies,\" Bridenstine said at the International Academy of Astronautics' 2019 Planetary Defense Conference in College Park, Md., according to Space.com. \"This is about ultimately protecting the only planet we know right now to host life, and that is the planet Earth.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

The event is slated to occur on Nov. 11 and won't be seen again from Earth until 2032. According to NASA's website, the event can be seen with proper safety equipment from 4:35 a.m. to 10:04 a.m. PST. \"Because Mercury is so small from our perspective on Earth, you'll need binoculars or a telescope with a Sun filter to see it,\" NASA wrote on its website, adding that the event \"only happens about 13 times per century.\" An artist's depiction of BepiColombo during one of its two Venus flybys en route to Mercury.

In order to view it, astronomers will need telescopes or binoculars fitted with protective solar filters. These events generally occur in early May and early November, Space.com added. It's not viewable from Earth every year as each planet takes a different amount of time to orbit the Sun, so they need to be lined up in the right place at the right time for it to be viewable with proper equipment. According to Time and Date, the event will span 5 hours, 28 minutes, 47 seconds, so people all over the U.S. will have ample time to see it. It will also be viewable in sizable parts of South America, Europe, Asia and Antarctica. If you are not able to access safe and proper equipment, there are several ways to look at the event online, including NASA's Mercury Transit website, which will provide videos and images. Astronomy streaming service Slooh will also have a livestream of the event on its YouTube channel, starting at 7:30 a.m. EST, Space.com added.

    "articleText": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 5 Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 5 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Charles Darwin is credited with the idea that life on Earth evolved in shallow pools of water. Now, a new study suggests that instead of life originating in a \"warm little pond,\" it may have come from deep-sea hydrothermal vents — an idea that could hold significance for extraterrestrial life. The research, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, suggests that these deep-sea environments had the heat and alkalinity to start life. \"There are multiple competing theories as to where and how life started,\" said the study's lead author, University College London professor Nick Lane, in a statement. \"Underwater hydrothermal vents are among most promising locations for life's beginnings — our findings now add weight to that theory with solid experimental evidence.\" Charles Darwin (AP) METEORITE STRIKES MADE LIFE ON EARTH POSSIBLE, STUDY SAYS Lane and the other researchers were able to recreate an environment similar to the deep-sea vents, using \"protocells with a mixture of different fatty acids and fatty alcohols\" that previous unsuccessful experiments did not use. They found that molecules with longer carbon chains needed heat in order to form protocells, with the alkaline solution helping keep the electric charge. The saltwater environment was also beneficial, as the fat molecules formed a stronger, more stable vesicle, or structure. In 2012, a study was published that, at the time, was believed to have proven Darwin right about where life originated on Earth. In 1871, Darwin wrote a letter to British botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker that life may have started in a \"warm little pond.\" \"It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present,\" Darwin wrote in the letter, digitized by the Darwin Correspondence Project. \"But if (& oh what a big if) we could conceive in some warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia & phosphoric salts,—light, heat, electricity &c present, that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter wd be instantly devoured, or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.\" An 1875 photo of Charles Darwin along with his seminal book, \"On the Origin of Species.\" (AP Exchange) Previous experiments to create protocells from fatty acids were successful in cool, fresh-water but \"only under very tightly controlled conditions,\" the statement added. Other past experiments to create protocells in hydrothermal vent environments had failed. \"In our experiments, we have created one of the essential components of life under conditions that are more reflective of ancient environments than many other laboratory studies,\" one of the study's co-authors, Sean Jordan, added in the statement. \"We still don't know where life first formed, but our study shows that you cannot rule out the possibility of deep-sea hydrothermal vents,\" Jordan continued. BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE MAY HAVE COME FROM DEEP SPACE: 'KEY TO UNRAVELING FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS FOR HUMANKIND' Lane noted that since deep-sea hydrothermal vents may be responsible for the origin of life on Earth, it could have implications for life in the universe — these vents are elsewhere in the Solar System. \"Space missions have found evidence that icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn might also have similarly alkaline hydrothermal vents in their seas,\" Lane said. \"While we have never seen any evidence of life on those moons, if we want to find life on other planets or moons, studies like ours can help us decide where to look.\" An artist's depiction of the Europa Clipper spacecraft at work near Jupiter's moon Europa.

    "description": "We could go to Venus tomorrow with the technology we have today, urged a NASA scientific advisory group, and the group's members would like to get a mission off the ground as soon as possible.",
    "articleText": "Venus has been called Earth's \"evil twin.\" (NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center) We could go to Venus tomorrow with the technology we have today, urged a NASA scientific advisory group, and the group's members would like to get a mission off the ground as soon as possible. Representatives from the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) made a presentation to NASA's planetary science advisory committee on Sept. 24, recommending that the agency prioritize a mission to Venus, the second-closest planet to the sun. Mars is a popular destination for NASA missions, both due to the possibility of life on the planet and because the agency may send astronauts there as soon as the 2030s. That said, NASA does have separate calls for proposals to send missions to other solar system locations. Excluding flybys, Venus hasn't been visited by a dedicated NASA spacecraft in 25 years, even though scientists subsequently sent several mission proposals to the agency. Related: The Strange Case of Missing Lightning at Venus \"The Mars program has 'followed the water' and continued to look for evidence of life, but Mars only had liquid water present on its surface for a few hundred million years, [about] three billion years ago,\" said Darby Dyar, who made the VEXAG presentation and who is chair of astronomy at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, in an email to Space.com. \"Moreover, the Mars program has long united around a single goal,\" Dyar added, \"which is to bring samples back from Mars. NASA Headquarters is supporting that goal with planning now. So my feeling is that although many outstanding science questions about Mars remain, they are second order compared to the dire state of knowledge about Venus.\" So VEXAG hopes that NASA's current call for smaller Discovery missions will bear some fruit. The announcement of opportunity, which closed July 1, includes at least three Venus proposals. The Step-1 selections should be announced around January 2020. The Venus proposals include DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) to measure the chemical composition of Venus during a descent; the VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy) orbiter to examine the surface of Venus in high resolution; and Hyperspectral Observer for Venus Reconnaissance (HOVER) to examine Venus' clouds, chemistry, dynamics and surface to better understand its climate. A pressing question for the Venus community involves finding out how similar the planet may have been to Earth in the planets' early histories. Venus' size is similar to Earth's and its distance to the sun would have put the planet in the \"habitable zone\" — the location where liquid water could exist on the surface — when the sun was younger and dimmer. Although Venus is now a raging inferno, the story for life billions of years ago could be more optimistic. Venus scientists want to know whether (as some suspect) the planet had liquid water for 3 billion years, what kind of surface geology and rock types it has, the nature of its dormant plate tectonics (which might be key to sustaining life) and how similar Venus might be to rocky exoplanets very close to their parent stars. Tech advancements Temperatures at the surface of Venus can melt lead under normal circumstances and would cook a lander in moments. Highly shielded Soviet Venera spacecraft made it to the surface in the 1970s and 1980s, generally lasting anywhere from a few minutes to around an hour. But advancements in technology, the VEXAG group said, make it possible for a reasonably priced mission to survive longer today. VEXAG's 15th meeting in 2017, for example, pointed to NASA's High Operating Temperature Technology (HOTTech) program, which aims to create components in environments that are roughly 900 degrees Fahrenheit (500 degrees Celsius) or higher. A call for proposals cited at that time (in 2017) funded research in technology for solar cells, power generation, electronics (which can be quite sensitive to temperature fluctuations) and batteries. The individual projects were expected to complete their current phase of funding between 2018 and 2020, so results are still being analyzed in some cases. Some other technologies are close to maturity, such as NASA's Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) project, which is designed for environments including Venus. It includes a high-density, all-carbon layer for the entry interface and a lower-density insulating layer to protect delicate spacecraft components. HEEET was testedat NASA's Ames Research Center and is listed at technology readiness level (TRL) 6. (A component reaches TRL 7 when it is tested in space, and TRL 8 following tests on the ground and in space.) Another team at NASA's Glenn Research Center is working on high-temperature electronics designed for Venusian temperatures. These are based on silicon-carbide semiconductors that could last up to 4,000 hours on the surface. In 2016, engineers tested some of the circuits in the Glenn Extreme Environments Rig (GEER), which simulates the conditions of Venus, for nearly 22 days. (The test was ended at that time only for scheduling reasons, according to NASA; similar oscillator circuits have worked for thousands of hours.) VEXAG's recent technology road map (released along with a technology plan) indicates that the community could respond to a variety of different NASA opportunities today with viable missions, ranging from orbiters to small satellites to atmospheric entry probes and skimmers. Another possible option could be a short-lived surface platform or some sort of an aerial platform floating in a more temperate climate on Venus, which is to be found at an altitude of 34 miles (55 km). Longer-lived surface platforms could be ready in the medium term, before 2032, the community suggested. Many ideas, few opportunities But VEXAG must also be responsive to available funding, which happens when NASA makes calls for proposals for cheaper Discovery missions, more expensive New Frontiers missions, and ride-along or international opportunities. In its report, the community recommends responding to the predicted proposal cadence before 2022 with orbiters or an atmospheric entry probe. And between 2023 and 2032, VEXAG recommended adding surface platforms (long- and short-lived) and aerial platforms to the wish list. NASA's last Discovery call for proposals was in 2014, which generated five finalists — including two Venus missions: DAVINCI and VERITAS. According to Dyar, neither Venus mission was selected \"for unclear reasons,\" although both were deemed selectable — meaning that they could have flown immediately. The proposals lost out to Psyche and Lucy, two missions that will study asteroids. The last New Frontiers opportunity was in 2016, and the community submitted a Venus mission called VOX (Venus Origins Explorer), which would focus on high-resolution topography or altitude maps of the surface. While VOX was deemed selectable, NASA did not choose it as a finalist; the winner of that opportunity is Dragonfly, which will fly on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. NASA's last dedicated mission to Venus was Magellan, which entered orbit in October 1990 and was deorbited four years later. The agency has flown by the planet since with Galileo, Cassini and MESSENGER en route to other planets. Meanwhile, the European Space Agency operated Venus Express at Venus between 2006 and 2014, and Japan's Akatsuki mission successfully entered orbit there in 2015 on its second attempt. Akatsuki is the only operational mission at Venus right now. Should We Land on Venus Again? Scientists Are Trying to Decide Life on Venus?

The study led by researchers at Ohio State University and Yale University states that deforestation for timber and farmland is responsible for about 92 billion tons of carbon emissions into the environment since 1900. \"Our estimate is about a fifth of what was found in previous work showing that deforestation has contributed 484 billion tons of carbon - a third of all manmade emissions - since 1900,\" said Brent Sohngen, a professor of environmental and resource economics at Ohio State, in a statement. The professor said that widely accepted estimate didn’t take into account the planting of new trees and other forest management techniques that lower the environmental burden.

(LULA SAMPAIO/AFP via Getty Images) The model used in the new study did take those factors into account. “There was a significant shift toward treating forests as a renewable, rather than nonrenewable, resource in the last century, and we estimate that those reforestation and forest management efforts have led to a far smaller carbon burden on the environment,” Sohngen said. The study suggests that efforts to decrease carbon emissions should focus on industry.

The findings contradict years of conventional astronomy wisdom. The universe may actually be curved, like a giant inflated balloon, a new study claims. A study published on Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy examines data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is the faint echo of the \"Big Bang,\" to conclude that the universe is not flat. The findings, however, contradict years of conventional wisdom in astronomy. According to researchers, if the universe is curved, that curve is a gentle one. The idea that if you traveled far out into space beyond our galaxy moving in a straight line -- you'd eventually be back where you started -- is known as a \"closed universe.\" Most scientists believe instead in the idea of a \"flat universe\" that extends out in all directions and does not loop in on itself. NEADERTHALS USED EAGLE TALONS AS JEWELRY, SCIENTISTS SAY A new study posits that the universe is shaped more like balloon than a flat bed sheet. (ESA and the Planck Collaboration) CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES SIGNAL A 'FIRE AGE,' EXPERT CLAIMS Researchers claim to have found an anomaly in the CMB, which provides crucial information about the universe. The latest data reportedly shows that there's significantly more \"gravitational lensing\" of the CMB than expected — meaning that gravity seems to bend the microwaves of the CMB more than existing physics can explain. Sapienza University of Rome cosmologist Alessandro Melchiorri explained to Live Science that the closed-universe model would raise a range of problems for the field of physics. \"I don't want to say that I believe in a closed universe,\" he told Live Science. \"I'm a little bit more neutral. I'd say, let's wait on the data and what the new data will say. What I believe is that there's a discrepancy now, that we have to be careful and try to find what is producing this discrepancy.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP",

    "description": "Army is preparing to incinerate enemy weapons “targets” in an upcoming in a “lase-off” firing of its emerging Stryker-armed 50-kilowatt laser weapon designed to destroy drones, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and incoming enemy missiles.",
    "articleText": "Artist's illustration. (Northrop Grumman) Army is preparing to incinerate enemy weapons “targets” in an upcoming in a “lase-off” firing of its emerging Stryker-armed 50-kilowatt laser weapon designed to destroy drones, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and incoming enemy missiles. The Stryker-fired laser, in development for several years, is part of the Army’s fast-developing Initial Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) program designed to bring air-and-missile defense back to armored vehicles on the move in combat. The program will deliver 50 kilowatt (kW)-class lasers on a platoon of four Stryker vehicles in Fiscal Year 2022, an Army report stated. \"The time is now to get directed energy weapons to the battlefield,\" Lt. Gen. L. Neil Thurgood, Director of Hypersonics, Directed Energy, Space and Rapid Acquisition, said in an Army report. \"The Army recognizes the need for directed energy lasers as part of the Army's modernization plan. This is no longer a research effort or a demonstration effort. It is a strategic combat capability, and we are on the right path to get it in Soldiers' hands.” Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, are subcontractors in an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement between the Army and Kord Technologies, an Army report stated. F-35 SET FOR LASER BOOST The Army is setting an ambitious timetable for deploying laser weapons on Strykers, an approach that is indicative of a broad Army push to better expedite weapons delivery. The service expects to have operational lasers ready to deploy on Strykers by 2022, if not earlier. The strategy is to harvest and deliver mature weapons systems on an accelerated time frame while of course preserving the steps and key procedures necessary for successful deployment. This strategy is, not surprisingly, driven by the current threat scenario. “It is all about the ability to put photons on target. It is a system that can be deployed rapidly from a stowed position. It can engage an enemy at the speed of light. It has to be able to shoot from a moving platform and engage a moving target through an air column that can be full of rain, dust or turbulence -- and hold that energy on target long enough to get the desired effect,” Mark Skinner, Vice President of Directed Energy, Northrop Grumman, told Warrior. Skinner mentioned weather obscurants as part of the much-discussed “beam attenuation” challenge when it comes to laser weapons. Not only do lasers require substantial amounts of transportable electrical power but are also at times limited by certain adverse weather conditions. With this in mind, industry developers such as Northrop are exploring innovations designed to increase the range, functionality, power and durability of lasers to enable more attack options. OTAs are, per Army strategy, accelerated weapons acquisition programs aimed at meeting urgent needs. In fact, a 2018 Congressional Research Report specifically cites an Army urgent requirement for “IM-SHORAD to support Operation Atlantic Resolve to provide air and missile defense protection of Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Teams.” The report states that “IM-SHORAD is the Army's ‘initial’ solution, and new weapons systems and weapons carriers might be incorporated into future variants.” Operation Atlantic Resolve is a specific U.S. Army Europe-NATO effort to strengthen deterrence against Russia on the European continent. “We are on track to deliver a laser next year and support the Army’s effort to build a platoon of laser-combat-capable Strykers,” Skinner said. HOW AI CHANGES ATTACK MISSIONS FOR US FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS Speaking to the Army’s current weapons development strategy, Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Joseph Martin says Army modernization priorities, which of course include the SHORAD program, are on track, moving quickly and in need of consistent funding to move forward quickly. Martin’s strategic view corresponds to the Army’s current OTA-enabled expedited schedule to conduct the shoot-off in 2021 and then deploy the lasers in 2022. Naturally, funding will be necessary to sustain this time-schedule. Vendors involved in the program are of course partnering with Stryker-maker General Dynamics Land Systems. “All the modernization priorities are doing very well. We’re seeing the progress that we need to right now. We’ve got a lot of work to do. We need to continue to have consistent funding; without consistent funding, requirements can be requirements, but they’ll never turn into material that we develop,” Martin told Warrior in an interview. Funding questions are receiving additional focus, given that Congress is now finalizing its 2020 defense spending legislation in conference. While Martin did not specifically address the Stryker-laser program, he did talk about the current emphasis upon precision fires, accelerated modernization, new armored vehicle strategies and, perhaps of greatest significance, how emerging weapons and technologies are changing Army tactics to enable a doctrinal shift to multi-domain operations. “We’re modernizing the Army and changing our doctrine to multi-domain operations, and we’re taking a hard look at how we’re organized across the Army to make sure that we’re appropriately structured for, equipped with and trained to succeed and dominate in that environment,” Martin told Warrior. Adding new precision air-defense firepower to Strykers does further enable multi-domain operations, as it gives a fast-moving Stryker unit the ability to engage and take out air-threats while on the move. This aligns with large amounts of current Pentagon work, including major Army efforts, to stand up multi-domain task-force units for testing, experimentation and rapid development. 'FIRST-CUT-OF-STEEL' BEGINS NEW ERA IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, SUBMARINE WARFARE By being able to engage enemy drones, helicopters and even some fixed-wing enemy targets, air-defense lasers greatly improve air-ground tactical attack. Also, perhaps of even greater significance, Stryker-fire lasers could intercept incoming enemy air-missile attacks. As part of this mission, they do have some characteristics which could be described as stealthy. Unlike the explosive effect of firing a kinetic weapon such as a Stinger or Hellfire, a laser is quiet. It does, of course, give off a light signature, but that is potentially much less detectable than the sound of a missile firing, thus enabling a Stryker to avoid giving up its position. Lasers can also function as optical sensors able to identify or paint targets for other weapons. This kind of technology also contributes to multi-domain operations because, as platforms increasingly become more networked, air platforms such as drones and surveillance planes will be able to more quickly share targeting information which ground combat assets such as Strykers; this quickens the sensor-to-shooter kill chain and gives attacking forces a better opportunity to get ahead of an enemies’ decision cycle. It further enables tactical combat maneuver as ground attack vehicles can better interoperate with air attack, cueing drones on attack targets or receiving combat-relevant ISR in real time -- with much less latency. Army Strykers armed with lasers and other air-defense weapons are changing the Army to rethink its armored vehicle formations and rapidly integrate methods of incorporated unmanned systems -- ground and air drones -- into armored vehicle maneuver. The presence of new weapons of this kind might enable mobile units to hit enemies faster, add precision, and in some cases lower collateral damage. In a heavily populated urban area, for instance, firing a missile interceptor might cause a larger, more dangerous explosion; firing a laser which slowly burns a hole through the metal of an enemy air target can decrease fragmentation and tailor the timing of when an enemy asset is ultimately disabled. As part of this attack envelope, lasers are scalable. Several beams can be merged for a stronger impact, and its strength can be adjusted, enabling attackers with a range of options to include destroying or merely disabling a target. So while the initial weapon is slated as 50kw, the power will likely go up as technology allows. Lasers also bring the substantial advantage of staying ahead of the “cost curve,” making them easier to use repeatedly. In many instances, low-cost lasers could destroy targets instead of expensive interceptor missiles. NEW AIR FORCE NUCLEAR-ARMED ICBMS TO DEPLOY BY 2029 Furthermore, mobile-power technology, targeting algorithms, beam control and thermal management technologies are all progressing quickly, a scenario which increases prospects for improved laser applications in coming years. Fire-control oriented computer algorithms could quickly merge sensor data with targeting information and tactical details to give Strykers an ability to find and hit targets much more efficiently, and potentially at farther ranges. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for the laser shoot-off, the Army is naturally at times limited when it comes to offering details about ongoing competitions. However, the service did describe the Stryker-laser plan as slated to “complete a competitive performance checkout leading into a range demonstration against various threats.”",

The most powerful Ford ever is as happy on a twisty track as it is on a drag strip, Fox News Automotive Editor Gary Gastelu says. Ford decided to shock this year’s SEMA auto show in Las Vegas with an all-electric Mustang concept. (Ford) The prototype coupe features a battery-powered drivetrain from automotive sunroof and electric drive system supplier Webasto. (Ford) The Mustang Lithium has a 900 hp motor pack with 1,000 lb-ft of torque under its windowed hood and uses a next-generation 800-volt electrical system designed to handle gobs of power while reducing the amount of heat produced. To put that in perspective, the most powerful conventional Ford ever made is the 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500, which has a supercharged V8 rated at 760 hp and 625 lb-ft of torque. (Ford) While Ford didn’t release any performance numbers for the Lithium, one feature should spark the interest of car enthusiasts: a six-speed manual transmission. Electric cars typically don’t have--or even need--more than one gear, so the inclusion of a stick is all about adding a fun-to-drive element. (Ford) The body and suspension are equipped with various parts from the Ford Performance bin and the otherwise stock Mustang interior is accented with electric blue trim. There is also a tech-forward 10.4-inch infotainment screen that can be used to select from four driving modes labeled Valet, Sport, Track and Beast. FORD IS CHANGING ITS ELECTRIC CAR PLANS, NEW UAW AGREEMENT SUGGESTS Ford doesn’t have plans to put the Lithium into production, but has promised that a hybrid Mustang is in the works and will be unveiling a “Mustang-inspired” all-electric performance SUV on Nov. 17.

KRISPY KREME ORDERS MINNESOTA STUDENT WHO BOUGHT, RESOLD DOUGHNUTS TO 'SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS' According to Gonzalez, each weekend he would drive 540 miles, roundtrip, to a Krispy Kreme store in Clive, Iowa, as there are no locations of the doughnut chain in Minnesota – and haven’t been for 11 years – to load his car with up to 100 boxes. Gonzalez would then sell the boxes of doughnuts, which cost him about $8, for $17 to $20 a box. Now, it appears Krispy Kreme has had a change of heart and is instead encouraging the budding entrepreneur to maintain his side hustle.

Now, it appears Krispy Kreme has had a change of heart and is instead encouraging the budding entrepreneur to maintain his side hustle, and even donated 6,000 doughnuts to help fuel Gonzalez’s budding business venture. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Krispy Kreme did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment, but in a statement to Business Insider, the brand said that once it learned Gonzalez was putting the money he made from the doughnut sales toward his goal of graduating from college debt-free, the company wanted to help.

So, we are happy to work with Jayson as an independent operator to ensure consistent delivery of our high-quality doughnuts to our fans in Minnesota,\" the chain said. \"We wish Jayson great success and we're thrilled to help him achieve it by donating 500 dozen doughnuts when he restarts his business.\"",

Social media star Emily Skye is thrilled to finally have a diagnosis for the painful stomach bloating that has plagued her for months. The body-positive Australian fitness guru recently revealed that parasites and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) are to blame for her gut issues, and fans are applauding her honesty. On Monday, the Queensland blogger shared the health update with her Instagram following of 2.5 million, in a post that has since received over 43,000 likes. “I know what has been causing my gut bloating/pain!” Skye exclaimed. “I have parasites and SIBO and also have been sick from being run down.” MOM DEFENDS SPENDING OVER $1G A MONTH AT BEAUTY SALON WITH 3 DAUGHTERS: 'WE ARE FABULOUS' “It’s a great feeling to know I’m on the right track to getting my gut healthy again. It may take a long time though (could take a year or so) which is hard since I am a bit impatient, especially about my health,” she continued. “I’m working on getting rid of the parasites and balancing my good and bad bacteria in my belly.” The mom of one explained that she’s adjusted her probiotic intake in response to her body creating too much of the Lactobacillus strain of “good bacteria” and told followers she’d be happy to discuss more gut health issues in the future. “It’s amazing how our guts control EVERYTHING!

Clint Lorance, Army Green Beret Major Matt Golsteyn and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. Fox News' Pete Hegseth reveals the exclusive details. Family members of a decorated Army Green Beret who is charged with premeditated murder in the 2010 death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker are speaking out after an announcement that President Trump is expected to take \"imminent\" action in his case. The development came as Maj. Matt Golsteyn was preparing to travel to Afghanistan to confront his alleged accusers, a bizarre twist in the case following a motion by the prosecution last month, according to his family. Fox News' Pete Hegseth said Monday on \"Fox & Friends\" that he spoke to the president over the weekend, and that Trump will meet with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to discuss the cases of three former military service members, including Golsteyn. The president is expected to make an announcement before Veterans Day on Nov. 11, Hegseth said. Julie Golsteyn told Fox News the family is \"thankful for a commander-in-chief who rises above politics and truly supports the war fighter.\" \"I am so very grateful that the commander-in-chief has decided to act to end this nightmare for Matt and our family,\" she said Tuesday. \"We are looking forward to healing and finally moving on with our lives.\" Julie and Matt Golsteyn with their son, Henry, in February.

But the prosecution recently motioned for a trip to Afghanistan to depose two Afghans whom it claims are witnesses in the case, only recently discovered this year, according to Julie Golsteyn. \"If Matt wants to confront his accusers, he has to go to Afghanistan -- a combat zone,\" she said. Video \"His attorneys are going, and as of now he's going,\" Julie told Fox News in October. \"We're putting the constitutional rights of a special forces officer behind the request of a so-called [Taliban] family member's request.\" The Army Criminal Investigative Command (CID) in Quantico, Va., told Fox News that \"due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to provide any comment at this time.\" CID did not respond to Fox News' inquiry regarding a potential trip to Afghanistan. Video This is the second time the Army has investigated the 2010 case involving Matt Golsteyn. An initial probe didn't find sufficient evidence to bring charges. A second investigation was opened in 2016 and Golsteyn was charged in December 2018. He could face life in prison if convicted. His wife has repeatedly called the case against her husband a \"complete set-up,\" a \"farce\" and a \"kangaroo court.\" The \"bad actors\" actively working against her husband are \"truly evil people,\" Julie Golsteyn said. \"I don't know how these people look in the mirror and sleep at night.\" Video Hegseth said Monday that Trump is also considering the cases of Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his soldiers to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in Afghanistan in 2012, and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was found not guilty of murdering an Islamic State (ISIS) fighter in Iraq in 2017 but was convicted in July of a lesser charge of posing for a photo with the dead ISIS prisoner's corpse. Gallagher's punishment included a reduction in rank from chief petty officer to 1st class petty officer, which is slated to cost him about $200,000 in retirement funds.

A man who was stabbed to death outside a Maryland Popeyes Monday night had cut to the front of a line to get dibs on the chain's popular chicken sandwich, police said on Tuesday. Prince George's County Police Chief Hank Stawinski told reporters that 28-year-old Kevin Davis entered the restaurant in Oxon Hill and started “methodically” cutting a line reserved for the menu item. Stawinski said that Davis was confronted by another man when he cut to the front of the line. “Over the course of fifteen minutes this individual works his way methodically ahead of everybody else in that line, is confronted by this individual and then from the moment of that confrontation, 15 seconds later, the two of them are out in front of the store, a stabbing occurs and an individual’s life is lost,” Stawinski told reporters. MAN DIES AFTER STABBING IN MARYLAND POPEYES; FIGHT OVER CHICKEN SANDWICH, SOURCES SAY He added, “The question my detectives have to answer is: how does a confrontation lead to a homicide in 15 seconds?” Police said the preliminary investigation revealed Davis and the suspect got into a brief verbal argument. They both then got out of the line and walked out the front door together before the suspect stabbed Davis, investigators said. Police said Davis was rushed to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police are asking the public for help identifying the suspect and a woman he was with, who they said is a person of interest. Police have asked the public for help identifying the suspect.

Police say this woman who left with the suspect is considered a person of interest. (Prince George’s County Police Department) Police added that they do not have information that “this was a longstanding dispute or that it is anything outside of what had occurred.” Stawinski told reporters the restaurant was packed with at least three dozen people, including children, when the fight and stabbing occurred. “What bothers me about this ... is that there are families and children in this restaurant as this is unfolding and they’ve been exposed to this now as well,” Stawinski said. “This is pointless, this is disrespectful.” He said he reviewed the surveillance video and there were several children in the restaurant who were “obviously shocked” about what was unfolding in front of them. Police said a knife was recovered from the scene. Investigators examine the scene in Oxon Hill Monday night. (Fox 5) Popeyes resumed selling its chicken sandwich on Sunday.

We do not yet know whether this was the result of a dispute over one of our products or something unrelated, but there is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot.” “Our thoughts are with the victim’s family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities,” the statement went on to say.

    "articleText": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 5 Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 5 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com A defiant Arizona elected official accused of running a human smuggling scheme involving pregnant women from the Marshall Islands pleaded not guilty Tuesday to state charges of fraud and theft and plans to go to court to challenge his work suspension. Attorney Kory Langhofer said that Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen will try to resolve the dispute outside of court, but will file a lawsuit contesting the county governing board’s decision to enact a 120-day unpaid suspension if those efforts fail. Paul Petersen<br> (Maricopa County Assessor's Office via AP, File) Federal prosecutors have alleged Petersen was the head of an adoption ring that illegally paid women from the Marshall Islands to give birth in the U.S. and then give their babies up for adoption. Petersen allegedly relied on associates on the islands, where he’d done a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, to recruit women by offering them $10,000 each, then charged U.S. families between $25,000 and $40,000 per adoption. After Petersen refused calls to resign, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors suspended the assessor, whose office determines the value of properties in Phoenix and its suburbs for tax purposes. The board doesn’t have the power to remove him from office, but it said the law allows it to suspend Petersen, a Republican, for “neglect of duty” due to his absence from work while he’s been incarcerated. TUCSON TO VOTE ON BECOMING ARIZONA'S ONLY SANCTUARY CITY Petersen has been indicted in federal court in Arkansas, and he’s also charged with crimes in Utah. He has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and has not yet been arraigned in Utah. Langhofer has said the board's Oct. 28 decision to suspend Petersen isn’t constitutionally sound because his client and the board are equals and supposedly can’t oust each other. Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen, right, leaves his arraignment hearing with attorney Kurt Altman Tuesday. (AP Photo/Jacques Billeaud) \"They have decided to throw him out regardless of what the constitution says, and so I suspect this is going to end up in court,\" Langhofer said. The board said an audit of the Petersen’s office after his arrest found files from the adoption business on his county computer, which can’t be used for personal business. ARIZONA BOY, 5, CALLS 911 FOR MCDONALD'S AND POLICE DELIVER \"The board believes they are on solid legal footing,\" county government spokesman Fields Moseley said in response to Langhofer's claims. In addition to his work as an assessor, Petersen did private-sector work in adoptions. The smuggling case spans three years and about 75 adoptions. Authorities said the scheme defrauded Arizona’s Medicaid system of $800,000 because the women had no intention of remaining in the state when they applied for benefits. Authorities said the women came to the U.S. before they were due to give birth and were kept into cramped homes Petersen owned or rented, sometimes with little to no prenatal care. Under a compact between the U.S. and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Marshallese citizens can enter the United States and work without a visa, but cannot to so if they are traveling for adoption, authorities said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Authorities in all three states said the birth mothers and the adoptive families did not commit any crimes and will not be facing any charges. None of the completed adoptions will be undone as authorities do not believe the women were misled into believing their children would be returned at some point.

    "description": "Rapper Tekashi69 -- the stage name for Danny Hernandez -- shattered the informal charter of silence typical of celebrity defendants and lifted the lid on gang ties in the entertainment industry during an illuminating appearance in New York City court last month.",
    "articleText": "NEWARK, NJ - OCTOBER 28: 6ix9ine performs at 2018 Power105.1 Powerhouse NYC at Prudential Center on October 28, 2018 in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage) Rapper Tekashi69 -- the stage name for Danny Hernandez -- shattered the informal code of silence typical of celebrity defendants and spoke about gang ties in the entertainment industry during a court appearance in New York City last month. In testimony against two alleged members of Nine Trey, an East Coast wing of the United Blood Nation street gang, the 23-year-old platinum-selling rapper detailed a life of “robberies, assaults [and] drugs,” leading to the conviction of the duo on racketeering conspiracy and other charges. The eccentric rapper's testimony revealed that the same gang-world affiliation that helped boost his brand also came at a cost. Hernandez told jurors he joined the notorious gang, not only to earn credibility, but in part to aid his career in the limelight -- even confessing to paying a fellow member to shoot at a rival rapper in New York City last summer. Shortly after the shooting, Hernandez himself was a target, getting kidnapped in Brooklyn – and escaping only after turning over hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and claiming not to be part of Nine Trey. Hernandez testified during the trial last week that the pair of defendants were his captors. He said the two allegedly viewed him as a “poser” and not an authentic gangster. Hernandez, too, was charged with racketeering, gun and drug charges but cooperated with federal authorities. CHICAGO JURY CONVICTS GANGBANGER WHO EXECUTED 9-YEAR-OLD IN REVENGE KILLING Hernandez's wild story, however, is far from an isolated case, federal law enforcement officials told Fox News, noting its part of a dangerous trend in the entertainment industry. “It is almost a pre-requisite these days to belong to a gang. It has become part of popular culture and commercialized. It’s also an important part of an artist’s public relations campaign,” said one New York-based federal agent, tasked with infiltrating gangs and arresting members. “It is basically saying that the route you need to take is to join a gang to get successful. Thirteen and 14-year-olds with impressionable minds see this happen.” Law enforcement officials told Fox News they view the entertainment industry all too often acting as a marketing machine that glorifies gang violence and pushes it into the mainstream. The National Gang Center estimates there are around 850,000 gang members nationwide. Meanwhile, up to 80 percent of gun murders in major cities each year classified as being gang-related.

Mosby announced criminal charges against all six officers suspended after Freddie Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury while in police custody in Baltimore. Loc said he is a member of the Crips gang and Wolfe said he was with the Bloods gang. (AP Photo/David Goldman) (The Associated Press) In the case of Hernandez, authorities said he wasn’t a Blood at the beginning of his career. But once he started to get social media attention in 2017 -- and those around him saw he could make money from a gang connection -- his fan appeal took off. The “Dummy Boy” performer is hardly alone. Despite denials from her spokespeople, famed female rapper Cardi B – whose name was brought into the trial by Hernandez – was characterized as a member of the Bloods. Since her rise to fame four years ago, the 26-year-old – whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar – has curated an image largely influenced by the color red, a theme also threaded throughout her lyrics, such as“these is red bottoms, there is bloody shoes” and \"Red Barz.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 12: Cardi B attends Rihanna's 5th Annual Diamond Ball at Cipriani Wall Street on September 12, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images) She has also switched out “C” for “B,” illuminating keywords such as “Binderella,” and even claiming that guests to her wedding would be expected to wear her signature hue. In an interview with GQ last year, the hit rapper finally fessed up, saying she became a Blood at age 16 and had been “repping it for such a long time” despite declining participation and advising other young girls not to follow in her footsteps. The L.A. Bloods pointed out, according to TMZ, that troubled singer Chris Brown – despite throwing up gang signs – was not an initiated member of the gang, though they were fine with him representing the brand.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com A reported robbery at a Washington restaurant last month, in which two men were alleged to have tied up and sexually assaulted patrons before making off with their jewelry, has turned out to be a “deliberate hoax” concocted in an attempt to secure immigration visas, police say. King County Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht says investigators are now questioning 10 people linked to the fake incident reported on Oct. 19 at Bob’s Burgers and Teriyakis in SeaTac, where officers raced after receiving a 911 call claiming “patrons were allegedly tied up, robbed of jewelry and two female members were said to be sexually assaulted.” “I can confirm to you that it was all a lie,” Johanknecht revealed at a press conference Monday. “Every employee present that evening, every customer participated in a deliberate hoax.” The restaurant where the robbery was reported to have happened on Oct. 19. Police say after speaking with those at the scene, the stories they were told started to unravel as they contained inconsistencies. (Google Maps) NORTH CAROLINA MAN ARRESTED FOR IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER, POLICE SAY Johanknecht said detectives believe the participants orchestrated the hoax because they wanted to apply for “non-immigrant U visas,” which “are available to those who are victims of crime and have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and who assist law enforcement in solving that crime.” She added: “Our detectives believed that participants hoped to avoid deportation [by] applying for and receiving a federal U visa.\" The immigration status of the 10 alleged to have been behind the hoax is not immediately clear. Johanknecht said the robbers were described as two Samoan males who escaped in a brown pickup truck that belonged to one of the victims. But “fairly early in the investigation,” she said, “there were several things that were not making sense.” “Eventually somebody offered up the true and correct information and then that, of course, made somebody else say, ‘yea, we made it up’,” Johanknecht added. NEW YORK OFFICER WHO DIED IN 'TRAGIC' CAR ACCIDENT INADVERTENTLY SHOT HIMSELF IN THE LEG, POLICE SAY SeaTac Police Capt. Jon Mattsen said Monday that the hoax consumed a “tremendous amount of resources” from his department: nine deputies and a sergeant who initially responded to the scene, and another six detectives who continued working on the case. “For this elaborate of a hoax to have occurred, and for this many people to have undertaken this event, it shows that there was a lot of planning involved in this, and that there was a lot of active thought put into how this was going to be undertaken,” he said. “I don’t recall a time where I’ve seen 10 people band together to form a story and present it to individuals whose very job is to note consistencies and inconsistencies… to flesh out the truth,” Mattsen added. “Never seen this happen in 30 years.” The reported robbery generated an outpouring of support from customers and the community in the days and weeks afterward, KOMO News reported. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yet now, Johanknecht said, police, detectives and prosecutors are deciding what charges may be filed against the participants at the state level. As of Tuesday, police have not taken anyone into custody. “This hoax should be an affront to all of us – especially those real victims of violence and sexual assault that U visas were intended to protect,” she said.",

Clearcreek Township police were called to a residence on the 7000 block of Waterway Drive in Waynesville at around 2:24 p.m. Friday over reports of a “possible overdose.” TENNESSEE TEEN MAULED TO DEATH BY PACK OF DOGS, ‘TOSSED AND DRAGGED INTO WOODS’: REPORT Once on the scene, police discovered Mary Matthews, 49, lying unresponsive on the bathroom floor, partially naked from the waist down and covered in blood and what appeared to be bite marks, according to a police report. Once on the scene, police discovered Mary Matthews, 49, lying unresponsive on the bathroom floor, covered in blood and what appeared to be bite marks, according to a police report. (Facebook) The responding officer noted that there was a significant amount of blood in the home, including on door frames, the washer and dryer and the walls leading to the bathroom where Matthews was found. He said her injuries included “numerous cuts or puncture marks and at least one chunk of her flesh appeared missing from her upper ankle area.” Medics arrived on the scene a short time later and pronounced the victim dead on arrival. Further investigation revealed more blood throughout the home and several bloodied articles of clothing. Police also found dog hair and what appeared to be a “small chunk of flesh” in the fold of a couch in the living room. Outside the house on an enclosed deck, officers found “two large, but thin” Great Danes. MASSACHUSETTS TEEN MAULED TO DEATH BY ‘PACK OF DOGS’ HE WAS TENDING TO: POLICE According to Matthews’ husband, Dale Matthews, one of the dogs was known to be “vicious” and had attacked him and several other people on previous occasions. He told police that he was able to fend off the dogs, but his wife would likely not be able to because of her “small stature.” Chief Coroner Doyle Burke made a preliminary ruling that Matthews appeared to die after being attacked by the two animals. Police also found several piles of beer cans stacked throughout the residence, as well as numerous medication bottles, indicating to investigators that Matthews may have not called for help because she was not in a “clear-minded state.” “It appears that she was able to get them [dogs] outside, but perhaps didn’t recognize the extent of her injuries and felt she could handle things on her own,” the report stated. “There was evidence of several clothing changes, all containing blood, including towels which appeared to be [the victim’s] attempt to clean up the floor or perhaps herself.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Matthews’ husband, who was released from the Warren County Jail the day he found her body, told police that she had a daily habit of “consuming prescription medications and would start drinking beer” until “passing out.” The dogs are being held for potential bite comparisons, police said.",

    "articleText": "close Video National forecast for Tuesday, November 5 Janice Dean has your FoxCast. The official start of winter may be more than a month away, but an early preview is on the way for later this week in parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center said a storm system is forecast to produce the first \"measurable snowfall of the season\" for parts of the eastern Great Lakes, northern Mid-Atlantic and New England through Friday. A series of weak storms this week is bringing a mix of rain and snow across the Northern Plains into the Great Lakes, helping to set the stage for more wintry weather later this week, according to Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean. WINTER LIKELY TO BE WARMER BUT HAVE 'LARGE SWINGS' IN TEMPERATURES AND PRECIPITATION, NOAA SAYS \"There's some cold air moving in,\" Dean said on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday. \"A couple of shots of cold air, not only that but some snow in the forecast. Along the coast, we are not going to get snow but we could see some measurable snow across the Great Lakes and the interior Northeast.\" The WPC said that two \"potent\" cold fronts will swing through the central and eastern U.S., bringing widespread temperatures well below-average between Thursday and early next week. Snowfall forecasts for the Midwest and Northeast through Friday. (Fox News) As a cold front pushes through the region on Thursday, light rain and snow are expected across the Northeast. \"As the front exits the New England coast on Friday, a low-pressure system may develop and strengthen, leading to a swath of light-to-moderate snow,\" the WPC notes. \"The greatest chance for accumulating snow greater than 4 inches currently stretches from northern Pennsylvania to Maine, but uncertainty still remains on exact amounts and location.\" Parts of Pennsylvania and upstate New York may see a range from 1 to 3 or 3 to 6 inches, with higher totals into New England, according to AccuWeather. A cold rain is likely from Philadelphia to New York City and a mix further up to Boston as the storm moves north. Light snow and rain are expected across the Great Lakes and into parts of the Northeast as a cold front moves through the region. (Fox News) Lake-effect snow is also possible as the cold front moves through on Friday evening and again on Sunday into Monday as a second cold front crosses the Great Lakes, according to forecasters. Once the storm moves out, frigid temperatures are expected to stick around.

(Fox News) \"Much colder air is in the forecast next week with better chances of snowy weather,\" Dean said. While winter doesn't officially begin until Dec. 21, government forecasters have advised there may be some \"large swings\" due to volatile weather patterns. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its winter outlook that warmer-than-average temperatures are forecast for much of the U.S. this winter, with a wetter-than-normal season from December through February across the northern parts of the country.

Nicolas Rivera, 28, was apprehended by federal authorities Monday after detectives allegedly discovered child porn images during the Montalvo probe. Rivera, who faces eight counts of child pornography, has been identified as a “person of interest” in the woman's slaying. Angel Luis Rivera (Osceola County Police Department) Rivera's arrest, however, is only the most recent in a string of arrests of Montalvo's former relatives. Her estranged husband, 31-year-old Christopher Otero-Rivera, Nicolas’s brother, and the pair's father, 63-year-old Angel Rivera, were arrested last week and charged with first-degree murder. They're both being held without bail at the Osceola County jail. Christopher Otero-Rivera (Osceola Police Department) MURDERED FLORIDA WOMAN'S ESTRANGED HUSBAND, IN-LAWS ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH BRUTAL KILLING Authorities also arrested Montalvo’s mother-in-law, 59-year-old Wanda Rivera – Angel’s wife and Nicolas and Christopher's mom – on Friday for allegedly tampering with evidence related to the homicide and providing false or misleading statements to detectives.

A California transit employee being hailed as a hero after saving a passenger who fell onto the tracks as a train was bearing down said Monday he was just doing his job. John O'Connor, a transportation supervisor for Bay Area Rapid Transit, was helping with crowd control after an Oakland Raiders game around 5:20 p.m. on Sunday at the Coliseum station in Oakland. At the time, O'Connor was making sure passengers stayed away from the yellow safety strip when a man holding a cell phone suddenly ventured too close to the edge and fell onto the tracks -- just as the southbound train was approaching the station. \"I just looked and was like, he's not going to make it,\" O'Connor told reporters Monday. \"So I've got to do something. There wasn't a lot of time to think.\" MISSING NEW ZEALAND WOMAN, 47, SURVIVES TWO DAYS LOST AT SEA IN DINGHY BY RATIONING BOILED CANDY Surveillance footage released by the transit agency shows O'Connor, a BART employee for 24 years, reaching down and pulling the unidentified man out, just before the train would have crushed him. BART transportation supervisor John O'Connor pulls a man back onto the platform just before a train arrives at the Coliseum Station in Oakland, Calif. on Sunday. (Bay Area Rapid Transit) \"In my mind, it all went down in slow-motion,\" he said. \"I just grabbed him and pulled him out.\" The BART supervisor said he wasn't sure where he found the physical strength to pull the man out, saying he didn't feel \"heavy at the moment.\" When O'Connor got the man back on the platform, a passenger on the platform took a video later posted to Twitter that showed the two men embracing. John O'Connor said it feels awkward to be called a hero when he was just doing his job. (KTVU) \"I'm just fortunate that God put me there,\" O'Connor said. \"And he got to see another day. And when I spoke with him later, I said, 'Hey, just pay it forward.,\" ARIZONA WOMAN RESCUED FROM CAR SECONDS BEFORE TRAIN HITS VEHICLE, VIDEO SHOWS BART leaders and passengers hailed O'Connor's actions as nothing short of heroic. \"The BART supervisor - his actions were remarkable - the way he stepped in and saved that man's life,\" Delonzo Starks told the Associated Press on Monday outside the station where the rescue occurred. \"It would have been horrible for that to happen, just in front of all the witnesses. So it's just a blessing that the BART supervisor was there.\" But the transit supervisor said he feels \"awkward\" being called a hero, and that he just did \"what we are supposed to do.\" BART Transportation Supervisor John O'Connor said he told the man he rescued from the tracks to \"pay it forward\" in the future. (Bay Area Rapid Transit) \"I'd like to think that anybody else in there would have done the same thing. God put me there for a reason, right?\" he said Monday. \"He got to go home. Hopefully, he cures cancer or something. He seemed to be a young man, got a lot of life ahead of him. Hopefully, it's a good one.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The unidentified man who was rescued was described as being in his 20s. He was taken to the hospital, but not for any injuries connected to the fall, KTVU reported. BART officials told KTVU on Monday that incidents of people accidentally falling onto the tracks are rare, happening less than once a year on average. Nevertheless, they're considering a pilot plan to install barriers. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "articleText": "close Video 'Florida man’ browser extension pokes fun at Trump, Sunshine State The ‘Daily Show’s’ 'Florida man’ browser extension pokes fun at President Trump and his move to the Sunshine State. President Trump has become the ultimate \"Florida man.\" The 45th president — a born-and-bred New Yorker — announced Thursday he's moving his official residence from New York City to Palm Beach, Fla., citing the way he's been treated in the Empire State by the Democratic politicians in charge at the city and state levels. FLORIDA MAN MAKES FLORIDA HIS PRIMARY RESIDENCE, BUT SAYS NEW YORK WILL 'HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART' Palm Beach is the location of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, which he's used frequently as a getaway during his presidency. To commemorate the East Coast address change, Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" created a browser extension that changes all references of Trump's name to \"Florida man.\" The phrase \"Florida man\" has become an infamous descriptor for males involved in all sorts of crazy or absurd news in the Sunshine State (yes, \"Florida woman\" exists, too). An Internet meme that's spawned all sorts of social media offshoots, it's typically used at the start of headlines and stories about crazy events that, for some reason, keep happening in Florida. Using the extension on Google Chrome and Firefox, Trump's Twitter handle becomes \"@realFloridaMan\" instead of his signature @realDonaldTrump.\" FLORIDA MAN DRESSED AS TRUMP AT HALLOWEEN FAIR ALLEGEDLY PUNCHED IN FACE BY 14-YEAR-OLD \"Florida man is the 45th and current president of the United States,\" the president's Wikipedia page reads with the extension. \"Florida man was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens, and received a B.S. degree in economics from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\" But Trump isn't the only target of the replacements. Because one of the president's sons also bears his name, Donald Trump Jr., the browser extension works on him, too. Below are some of the more amusing examples of the \"Florida man\" extension in action.",

    "articleText": "President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in, Lexington, Ky., Monday, Nov. 4, 2019. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your Tuesday ... Trump calls on 'angry majority' send Democrats a message as elections in four states could give early peek into 2020 At a rally on friendly turf in Kentucky Monday night, President Trump urged what he called an \"angry majority\" of voters to send a powerful \"signal\" to Democrats and the world by handing the GOP a big victory not only in Tuesday's gubernatorial race there, but also in the pivotal upcoming statewide elections in Virginia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The result of the showdown in Kentucky -- as well as Tuesday's gubernatorial race in Mississippi and state legislature races in Virginia and New Jersey -- could serve as a barometer this week on whether Trump still has the ability to rally Republicans at the voting booth amid Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry. Video Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September. Amid chants of \"USA\" at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin. Video At one point, the president reminded the audience that American special forces had just provided \"the world's number-one terrorist a one-way ticket to hell,\" in a colorful reference to the now-dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

President Hassan Rouhani announced on Tuesday that Tehran will begin injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges, the latest step away from its nuclear deal with world powers since President Trump withdrew from the accord over a year ago. (Office of the Iranian Presidency via AP) Iran's president announces another break from nuclear deal Iran's president announced on Tuesday that Tehran will begin injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges, the latest step away from its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers since President Trump withdrew from the accord over a year ago. The development is significant as the centrifuges previously spun empty, without gas injection, under the landmark 2015 nuclear accord. It also increases pressure on European nations that remain in the accord, which at this point has all but collapsed. On Monday, during an event commemorating the 40th anniversary of revolutionaries seizing the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran announced it was now operating 60 advanced centrifuges, twice as many as allowed by the accord, and is experimenting with a prototype designed to be 50 times faster than what's allowed by the nuke deal. - Reported by the Associated Press Video Dems release first impeachment probe transcripts from closed-door interviews At his Kentucky rally, Trump stood in front of throngs of attendees wearing \"Read the transcript!\" shirts -- a reference to the White House's readout of the president July call with Ukraine's leader that is the center of House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry. On Monday, House Democrats leading the inquiry publicly released the first transcripts from their closed-door interviews, airing concerns from witnesses about the activities of President Trump's associates related to Ukraine. Video The panels released testimony from former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Among revelations in the transcripts: Yovanovitch testified that Ukraine told her about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s campaign to oust her. Yovanovitch was pushed out of her job in May on Trump's orders. Republicans, in turn, complained that Democrats were conducting the proceedings in private and were selectively releasing transcripts. Trump has urged Republicans to release their own transcripts. Click here for more. FILE - In this July 16, 2019, file photo, Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of President Donald Trump leaves federal court in Washington. (AP Photo/Sait Serkan Gurbuz, File) Former Trump confidant Roger Stone goes on trial Social media posts? Banned. Video clips from \"The Godfather: Part II?\" Banned. Transcripts from \"The Godfather: Part II?\" Not banned. Those are just some of the unusual ground rules set out by Obama-appointed U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson for the widely anticipated trial of former Trump confidant Roger Stone, which begins on Tuesday in Washington. Stone, a longtime Republican provocateur and part-time fashion critic, is accused of lying about his efforts to obtain Russian-hacked Hillary Clinton emails for political gain. His indictment in January was an offshoot of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and Judge Jackson ruled that Stone's legal team would have access to most of the redacted materials in Mueller's report in order to prepare his defense. Stone is not charged with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published emails of Democrats during the 2016 campaign, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them. Instead, he is accused of lying about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release during probes by Congress and Mueller’s team. Trump, for his part, has said Stone has been unfairly targeted. Some critics considered Stone's arrest unusual and heavy-handed: It took place at the hands of highly-armed police, during a predawn raid and CNN cameras were in place. Video United States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal The United States submitted a formal notification that it will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday, a move that has been widely expected since President Trump announced his intention to do so in 2017. The climate agreement, which went into force Nov. 4, 2016, committed countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years, meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016. Trump has previously said that the Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Getting local governments to address much-needed street repairs can sometimes take years. A Canadian man's request to fix the curb in front of his Winnipeg home could take nearly a half-century by the time city workers get around to it. Calvin Hawley reported damage done to the curb outside his home by a snow removal machine in 1993. Years of calls and complaints went unanswered until the city finally gave him a target date for the repairs: June 26, 2037. \"It's 26 years old right now, if you do the math and they don't get around to doing it until their target date of 2037. Then this is damage that would have sat here for [44] years. How is that reasonable?\" Hawley told the Candian Broadcasting Corporation. HISTORIC IRON SCOW MOVES FOR FIRST TIME IN 101 YEARS, CLOSER TO NIAGARA FALLS LEDGE \"It is kinda funny when you think about. It will be a grand day when they actually come out,\" he added. Hawley remembers the date the curb was damaged--Jan. 26, 1993, the day his second son was born. \"I came home from the hospital ... and discovered a large chunk of curb under a whole whack of snow,\" he said. He said he's called the city on and off for years to plead for repairs. At one point, Hawley was told the city's system for logging complaints had changed and that his was no longer on record. As time passed, the rebar on the curb began to crumble and became more exposed. With the help of neighbors, he placed decorative stones where the chunk of curb used to be. The final straw came on July 1, 2017. \"I was watching crews merrily drive past the front of my driveway to stop and repair other curbs on the other side of the bay that weren't as damaged as mine or as old,\" Hawley told CBC. He filed yet another complaint later that day. That's when he was given his repair date, scheduled for nearly 18 years in the future. Ken Allen, a city spokesperson, told CBC that repairs are always inspected by the city before work can begin. Repairs to residential streets not deemed to be hazardous can take up to more than a year to be addressed, he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The anticipated timeframe for curb repairs to be made varies and also depends on street priority. Regional streets is five years, non-regional streets is ten years and residential streets is 20 years,\" Allen said. Winnipeg City Councillor Brian Mayes said he will bring up Hawley's issue with the city's chief administrative officer to get a more realistic date for the delayed curb repair. \"Hopefully, before I'm out of office we'll knock off [Hawley's],\" Mayes said.",

It took relatives hours to reach the ambush site in Sonora and, when they arrived, they found the baby Faith in the bullet-riddled vehicle belonging to her 29-year-old mother, Christina Marie Langford Johnson, relative Kendra Lee Miller said in a lengthy Facebook post Tuesday morning. “They found Christina's baby Faith with the vehicle around her riddled with bullet holes,\" she said in the post, which the New York Post first reported.

Similar to Johnson, Langford’s body was discovered in a separate location, Langford Jr. told the Tribune. 11 children survived Between the three families, 11 children miraculously survived, with some suffering injuries. Devin Blake Langford, 13, hid his bleeding siblings in nearby bushes while he made the 6-hour, 14-mile trek back to La Mora to get help, Miller wrote. Miller’s post detailed the injuries of the surviving Langford children: Kylie Evelyn, 14, was shot in the foot; McKenzie Rayne, 9, had a bullet graze her arm; Cody Greyson, 8, was shot in the jaw and leg; Zander Boe, 4, was shot in the back; and 9-month-old Brixon Oliver was shot in the chest and grazed on his wrist.

Alfonso Durazo, Mexico's top security official, said that six children were wounded in the attack, with five transferred to hospitals in Phoenix, Ariz. All the victims are believed to be members of the extended LeBaron family, who live in a religious community in La Mora, northern Mexico, a decades-old settlement in Sonora state founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around 70 miles south of Douglas, Arizona. Relatives said the group was attacked while traveling in a convoy of three SUVs. Durazo said the gunmen may have mistaken the SUV convoy for rival gangs. He said the Sinaloa cartel has an important presence in the area, but is fighting for the territory with rivals. Video Meanwhile, Miller said that the families were still seeking answers as they await justice. Trump in a tweet following the attack called on Mexico wage “war” on the drug cartels. \"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,” he wrote. “We merely await a call from your great new president!\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP But Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador later responded: \"The worst thing you can have is war.\" Fox News' Danielle Wallace and Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "articleText": "close Video Americans killed in cartel shootout in Mexico At least nine American citizens including children have been killed by a Mexican drug cartel after being ambushed on the road. The slaughter of at least nine Americans – including six children – at the hands of cartel gunmen in northern Mexico is the latest massacre pushing back against the Mexican president’s unclear security strategy of “hugs not bullets.” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador used the catchy phrase – “abrazos, no balazos” in Spanish – in his promise to clear out violent drug cartels, not by waging war, but instead changing communities by tackling what he said is the root of the problem: extreme poverty. “This is no longer a war. This is no longer about force, confrontation, annihilation, extermination, or killing in the heat of the moment,” the president said at a recent news conference. “This is about thinking how to save lives and achieve peace and tranquility in the country using other methods.” Clockwise from top left: Dawna Langford, Trevor Langford, Rogan Langford, Christina Marie Langford Johnson, Kristal Miller, Rhonita Maria Miller and twins Titus and Tiana, and Howard Miller. (GoFundMe) MEXICAN CARTEL MASSACRE: 9 AMERICANS, INCLUDING 8 CHILDREN FROM MORMON OFFSHOOT MURDERED However, Monday’s attack on a convoy of members of the La Mora religious community, a decades-old settlement in Sonora state founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as the recent botched arrest of a son of drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman raise questions on whether Lopez Obrador’s plans are actually working. “He can't continue with this strategy of peace and love with the criminals and say that there isn't war,” Raúl Benítez, a security expert and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told the Associated Press after at least eight people died in Culiacan during while an army antidrug unit captured and then released Ovidio Guzman Lopez – who is wanted by U.S. authorities on drug trafficking charges – to avoid further bloodshed last month. “The criminals are declaring war on the government and the country, the citizens, the people.” Video However, Lopez Obrador remained steadfast on Tuesday with his approach of not waging war, calling Monday’s massage a “lamentable situation.” During his morning news conference, Lopez Obrador promised that his government would do everything possible to find the perpetrators of Monday’s attack, but insisted that the strategy carried out by the previous two governments failed. “They declared war and it didn’t work,” he said. “They just put the people of Mexico in mourning.” A burning bus, set alight by cartel gunmen to block a road, is pictured during clashes with federal forces following the detention of Ovidio Guzman, son of drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, in Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico October 17, 2019. (REUTERS) LA MORA, THE MORMON OFFSHOOT COMMUNITY CAUGHT UP IN MEXICO'S BRUTAL DRUG CARTEL WAR Lopez Obrador said his government will not change his strategy of dealing with the country’s relentless cartel-fueled violence, saying he will continue to provide “a lot of well-being for the population and a lot of attention to young people.” “We will not yield on this,” he said. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, President of Mexico poses during a state visit to Mexico at Palacio Nacional on October 21, 2019 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Getty) He also rejected any help from the United States to help engage drug cartels in light of Monday’s deaths. President Trump spoke with Lopez Obrador on Tuesday, the White House said. “President Trump made clear that the United States condemns these senseless acts of violence that took the lives of nine American citizens and offered Mexico assistance to ensure the perpetrators face justice. The two leaders also discussed ongoing border cooperation and the strong bilateral ties between the United States and Mexico.“ Earlier, Trump offered his assistance to “wage war” against Mexico’s murderous drug cartel “monsters.” “If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively,” Trump tweeted. “The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!” In another tweet, he wrote: “This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!” The prosecutor's office in Sonora state gave a description of the crime scene on the Sonora-Chihuahua border. They said police first found the burned-out Chevy Tahoe with the five dead. About 11 miles up the mountainous dirt road, they found a Suburban with a dead woman and two dead children inside. Farther on, they found a second Suburban and, about 15 yards away, the body of a woman. Police found a total of about 200 spent shell casings from assault rifles and other weapons at the various crime scenes. TRUMP CALLS FOR 'WAR' AGAINST MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL 'MONSTERS' AFTER AMERICANS MURDERED During Lopez Obrador’s presidency, Mexico is on track to record more than 32,000 murders this year. Security experts said that the president’s strategy does not directly address the terrifying power of the country’s criminal underworld – which was brazenly on display on Monday and on Oct. 17 in Culiacan. Another bloody ambush to make headlines just last month was when a group of armed gunmen believed to be part of the Jalisco New Generation, one of Mexico’s most powerful cartels at the moment, ambushed a police convoy in the western state of Michoacan. At least 13 officers were killed and nine were wounded in that incident, which happened just four days before the Culiacan incident. Video In that case, Lopez Obrador defended the retreat of security forces, saying the \"capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people.\" \"This decision was made to protect citizens,\" he said at the time. \"You cannot fight fire with fire. We do not want deaths. We do not want war.\" MEXICAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS RETREAT OF SECURITY FORCES, RELEASE OF EL CHAPO'S SON Earlier this year, Fox News reported that kidnappings and murders were on the rise in Mexico. One victim was American photographer John Sevigny, who has traveled extensively for nearly two decades throughout Mexico and Latin America documenting, as he calls it, the “lives of people who are struggling to live.” He was snatched by sicarios in the city of Cordoba in the state of Veracruz in January. “I have met a lot of cartel people with my work – I haven’t met anyone as particularly cruel as these men. The sheer number of weapons blew my mind,” he told Fox News The U.S. Department of State issued a travel advisory for Americans visiting Mexico last year, saying to exercise increased caution due to crime. On Tuesday, it reiterated its commitment to the safety of Americans living and traveling abroad. Video 13 MEXICAN POLICE OFFICERS MURDERED BY SUSPECTED CARTEL GUNMEN IN BLOODY AMBUSH The most visible element of a security strategy under López Obrador was the creation of the National Guard. The new force was supposed to fill the security void created by corrupt, disbanded or outmatched police forces and to reduce the country's dependence on the military for domestic policing. A large portion of the guard, however, was detoured to immigration enforcement duties under pressure from the United States. It also remains unclear how the National Guard fits with the social programs that Lopez Obrador says will attack the root causes of crime in Mexico.

At least 13 police officers were killed and three others injured Monday in the ambush. (AP Photo/Armando Solis) Edgardo Buscaglia, an expert at Columbia University with more than two decades of experience on anti-organized crime, told Fox News in a statement Tuesday that organized crime in Mexico has flourished because Lopez Obrador and previous administrators have resisted the application of 29 institutional \"anti-mafia\" mechanisms that more than 60 countries have already adopted. \"No wonder that Mexico suffers high levels of paramilitary violence that in many cases constitute acts of terrorism, such as the latest Sinaloa Cartel's paramilitary takeover of Sinaloa's capital (Culiacan),\" he said.

The pup is said to be doing well after his fall and now lives on a dingo sanctuary. A young, stray puppy believed to have been dropped from the sky and into the backyard of an Australian family's property was actually a rare purebred dingo — an endangered wild dog breed native to Down Under. The animal was discovered in Wandiligong, in the state of Victoria, around 200 miles northeast of Melbourne, in August. Jane Guiney, who found the animal whimpering in her backyard, suspected the furry creature was a dog or a fox and was dropped on the ground by an eagle flying by. 6-YEAR-OLD MAULED BY PACK OF DINGOES AT AUSTRALIAN TOURIST SPOT Guiney's family cared for the dog for a day before taking it to a veterinarian to be treated for injuries, where it was determined the dog was actually a dingo.

So he was just a lonely little soul sitting in a backyard.\" The animal's DNA was tested for confirmation of its breed, and while they awaited results, the pup was taken to the Australian Dingo Foundation sanctuary. The test determined the dingo is a purebred Victorian Highlands Dingo, the sanctuary wrote on Instagram. The dingo, which has since been named \"Wandi,\" is fitting in nicely at the sanctuary, according to foundation director Lyn Watson. \"Wandi has a little playmate his same age because he has been born at the perfectly right time for dingos in winter,\" Watson said. \"He has tamed quite nicely. Whilst he is wild and always will be, he has become quite happy here and he likes the people that are caring for him.\" The sanctuary wrote online, \"He is living proof that the dingo is still prevailing in its purest form in Victoria.

    "articleText": "close Video Americans killed in cartel shootout in Mexico ,At least nine American citizens, including children have been killed by a Mexican drug cartel after being ambushed on the road. The innocent women and children who were massacred Monday in northern Mexico were members of a decades-old settlement founded as part of an offshoot of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. La Mora, a small community in Sonora state, where families farm pecans and raise cattle and is just a three-hour drive from the border over dirt roads, was founded by some of the original pioneers sent by the LDS Church to colonize Northern Mexico in the late 1800s, before being excommunicated by the Church. TRUMP CALLS FOR 'WAR' AGAINST MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL 'MONSTERS' AFTER AMERICANS MURDERED IN SHOOTOUT At least six children and three women living in the faith-based community were murdered when their convoy came under fire by gunmen, believed to be cartel members. Among those killed were Rhonita Maria LeBaron and her four children. Her burned-out bullet-ridden SUV was reportedly found outside the town of Bavispe, where the settlement is located. Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and Christina Marie Langford, 31, were also among those killed. MEXICAN CARTEL MASSACRE: 9 AMERICANS, INCLUDING 6 CHILDREN FROM MORMON OFFSHOOT MURDERED The Langford family is descended from the pioneers who established \"Colonia Oaxaca,\" which is now called \"Rancho Oaxaca,\" a famous Mormon colony, and the families, including the Millers and the LaBarons, are part of remnants from that. The majority of the dual U.S. citizens who live there go back and forth between Utah, other parts of the United States, and their community in La Mora. The women were traveling back to Utah when they were confronted by the cartels. Lafe Langford Jr., a relative, spoke to Fox News. \"It's just huge. It's just absolutely unimaginable,\" Langford said. \"This is the absolute worst nightmare for our entire existence in Mexico...and we never thought it was possible.\" Video He added: \"There's thousands of people affected by this. Just American citizens in Mexico, there's thousands affected by this.\" GINGRICH: DEATHS OF AMERICANS IN MEXICAN CARTEL SHOOTOUT ARE A 'WAKE-UP CALL' Langford said their families have never had \"even the slightest interactions with the drug cartel in the last 70 years\" and that they are loved by their community, serving the Mexican people. \"What we want right now is answers. Who and why. It was an attack on innocents, women and children.\" But 10 years ago, Benjamin LeBaron, the founder of crime-fighting group SOS Chihuahua, was killed in the neighboring Chihuahua after he led protests over the kidnapping of their 16-year-old brother. The Mormons refused to pay the ransom and the young LeBaron was ultimately released. The community of La Mora has about 350 people who live there full-time but the rest, about 800-1,000, live throughout the United States. DEA AGENT WHO NABBED EL CHAPO SHOCKED BY MEXICO'S RELEASE OF DRUG LORD'S SON: 'THERE IS NO POLICE HERE' The community, some practicing and the majority not, were part of a family that had some relatives excommunicated from the church for polygamy but still practiced Sunday School in their homes and was not within the distance of a church to attend. \"What sets us apart from the fundamentalist groups is that we don't claim priesthood authority and prophets and apostles outside of the Mormon Church,\" Langford said. \"We mainly believe the Mormon church is out of order and that's why we're excommunicated.\" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved. “Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence,” he tweeted.

The streets of Spain were filled with protesters – mostly women of all ages – on Monday as they demanded the country’s laws be changed after five men were acquitted of raping an unconscious 14-year-old girl.

(REUTERS) Monday's protests were held in more than 40 cities as the hashtag #EnoughPatriarchalJustice spread on social media. The protests came after a Barcelona-based court acquitted the five men accused of gang-raping an intoxicated 14-year-old girl of sexual assault. Instead, they were convicted of the lesser crime of sexual abuse and sentenced to 10 to 12 years behind bars. SPAIN COURT ACQUITS FIVE MEN OF RAPE BECAUSE NO FORCE NEEDED AGAINST UNCONSCIOUS VICTIM A woman holds up her hands outside the Justice Ministry in Madrid, Spain, Monday, Nov. 4, 2019. (AP) The court found that because the victim had drunk alcohol and smoked marijuana before the attack, she “could not accept or reject the sexual relations.” The men, it said, were, therefore, able to have sex with her without using violence or intimidation – an element required under Spanish law for a crime to be a sexual assault or rape. The assault took place in 2016 in Manresa, a town in northeastern Spain, at an abandoned factory where a group of young people had been drinking and using drugs. The victim said during the trial that she could not recall every detail as the five men took turns assaulting her but that she feared for her life because she believed they had a gun. The weapon turned out to be fake. Marian Fernandez, a 31-year-old psychologist, said protesters were seeking not just new laws or a better interpretation of the current ones. Monday's protests come after five men accused of gang-raping an unconscious 14-year-old three years ago were sentenced between 10 to 12 years behind bars for sexual abuse instead of assault or rape. (AP Photo/Paul White) \"It all comes down to respecting the concept of consent,\" she said. \"It's about understanding that 'no' means no and that only 'yes' means yes.\" In addition to being sent to prison, the men were fined a total of $13,300. FRANCO'S REMAINS GREETED WITH FASCIST SALUTES AT NEW RESTING PLACE Spanish media said the victim plans to appeal the verdict. This ruling reignited anger over how victims of sexual assault are treated in the Spanish legal system, echoing sentiments of another 2016 case in which an 18-year-old was alleged to have been raped by five men at the start of the Pamplona festival. A woman holds a sign reading ''Sister. I believe you'' as people gather at Plaza del Castillo square to a protest against sex assault, in Pamplona, northern Spain, Monday, Nov. 4, 2019. (AP Photo/Alvaro Barrientos) The initial verdict found the defendants guilty of sexual abuse because the judges saw no intimidation in the way the men cornered the victim in a lonely hallway. But that was overruled earlier this year by Spain's Supreme court following a wave of street protests. The court extended the men's prison terms from nine years to 15 in a landmark ruling that said that the victim, outnumbered, had been subjected to \"surrounding intimidation.\" BARCELONA PRO-INDEPENDENCE PROTESTERS CLASH WITH POLICE AFTER MASSIVE PEACEFUL RALLY A conservative government, then a Socialist one, promised to modify the criminal code to eliminate the distinction between \"abuse\" and \"assault.\" But progress has been slow amid a political stalemate that is unlikely to be immediately resolved on Sunday when Spaniards head to the polls for the fourth time in four years. The center-left administration of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez vowed to make explicit consent mandatory in all sexual relations and to launch a program to improve gender awareness among members of the judiciary.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some activists and experts said that even without legal changes, the outcome in the Manresa trial could have been different if the judges had drawn lessons from the Pamplona case. \"It's not enough with better laws; we also need judges who are well trained on gender issues,\" said Vivian Waisman, president of Women's Link Worldwide, a Madrid-based nonprofit organization that promotes women's rights. The new ruling, she added, \"is a reminder that the judicial system is repeatedly failing to protect female victims of sex assaults.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com Iraqi authorities trying to quell an anti-government uprising reportedly cut off Internet access for nearly all of Baghdad and the southern part of the country Tuesday as the latest wave of protests resulted in at least three deaths. Netblocks, a group that monitors worldwide Internet access, said that a major shutdown overnight sent usage levels plummeting to 19 percent of their normal amount in Baghdad and southern Iraq. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Internet there was partially restored, it added, but \"some networks are still offline and social media and messaging apps remain blocked or degraded.\" The move comes after Iraqi officials shut down Internet access and blocked social media sites on a number of occasions during protests in October – but this instance is the most severe yet, Netblocks says. Anti-government protests set fires while security forces fired live ammunition and tear gas near the state-run TV in Baghdad, Iraq, on Monday. (AP) Elsewhere in Iraq Tuesday, three protesters were killed in clashes with security forces. ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS STORM BAGHDAD In Umm Qasr, an oil terminal on the Persian Gulf, demonstrators seized an armored vehicle during skirmishes with troops, who have been responding by firing live ammunition and tear gas, security and medical officials say. One person was killed and eight more were injured in those incidents. The Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights also said two people were killed and 23 wounded in clashes in the southern city of Nasiriyah. “Appalled by continued bloodshed in Iraq. People’s high frustration not to be underestimated or misread,” Jeanine Hennis, a U.N. Iraq envoy, had tweeted Monday. “Violence only begets violence, peaceful demonstrators must be protected. It is high time for national dialogue.” A protester holds an Iraqi flag during demonstrations in Baghdad on Monday. (AP) Iraq has seen massive anti-government demonstrations in Baghdad and across the mostly Shiite south since Oct. 25. The protests are calling for an overhaul of the political system established after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, accusing the government and major political parties of corruption and incompetence. TWO ROCKETS FIRED NEAR U.S. EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD Protesters have been complaining of high unemployment and poor public services. Despite Iraq having the world's fourth-largest proven oil reserves, Baghdad and other cities still suffer frequent power cuts and the tap water in many areas is undrinkable. Security forces so far have killed at least 267 demonstrators since the protests began. In southern Iraq, protesters have ransacked and torched the offices of political parties linked to Iran, and on Sunday night they attacked the Iranian Consulate in the Shiite holy city of Karbala. In Baghdad, protesters crossed a bridge over the Tigris River on Monday and clashed with security forces near the headquarters of state-run TV and the prime minister's office. (AP) Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi has expressed support for the protesters' demands and condemned violence on all sides while resisting calls to step down. He has called on the protesters to reopen roads so that life can return to normal, saying the disruptions caused by the protests are costing the country billions of dollars. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He met with senior judicial and security officials at the Federal Police Headquarters late Monday to discuss ways to restore stability while preserving the right to protest and to protect private property, according to a government statement.

    "articleText": "close Video Americans killed in cartel shootout in Mexico At least nine American citizens including children have been killed by a Mexican drug cartel after being ambushed on the road. At least six children and three women living in a faith-based community of U.S. citizens in Mexico were shot to death Monday in the northern part of the country, and six more children were wounded after their convoy came under fire during a brazen daylight ambush believed to have been carried out by gunmen affiliated with the cartels. Alfonso Durazo, Mexico's top security official, confirmed the six deaths, adding that six more children were wounded in the attack, with five transferred to hospitals in Phoenix, Ariz. He had indicated that one child was still missing, although relatives later appeared to indicate that the girl, Mckenzie Langford, age 9, who had been grazed in the arm by a bullet and had gone for help only to get lost in the dark, was eventually found. Rhonita Maria Miller (left), along with 4 children, Dawna Langford (center) and Christina Marie Langford (right) were among those killed. (Facebook) All the victims are believed to be members of the extended LeBaron family, who live in a religious community in La Mora, northern Mexico, a decades-old settlement in Sonora state founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around 70 miles south of Douglas, Ariz. They said the group was attacked while traveling in a convoy of three SUVs. Durazo said the gunmen may have mistaken the SUV convoy for rival gangs. Police first found a burned-out Chevy Tahoe with five people. About 11 miles up the mountainous dirt road, they found a Suburban with a dead woman and two dead children inside. Farther on, they found a second Suburban and, about 15 yards away, the body of a woman. NEWT GINGRICH: DEATHS OF AMERICANS IN MEXICAN CARTEL SHOOTOUT ARE A 'WAKE-UP CALL' The victims were all dual Mexican and U.S. citizens and were traveling back to the U.S. when they were ambushed, according to Utah's KUTV. Local media, citing statements purportedly made by family member Julian LeBaron, said that Durazo informed him that three people had been detained in the attack against his family. Clockwise from top left: Dawna Langford, Trevor Langford, Rogan Langford, Christina Marie Langford Johnson, Kristal Miller, Rhonita Maria Miller and twins Titus and Tiana, and Howard Miller. (GoFundMe) Among those killed were Rhonita Maria Miller, 30, and her four children Howard, 12, Krystal 10, and 8-month-old babies Titus and Tiana. Her burned-out bullet-ridden SUV was reportedly found outside the town of Bavispe, where the settlement is located. Also killed were Christina Marie Langford Johnson, 31, Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and two of her children Trevor and Rogan, ages 11 and 2. Several other children survived the attack, including Faith Johnson, Christina's 7-month-old daughter, who was found in her car seat, seemingly put on the floor by her mother, unharmed.

This is the absolute worst nightmare for our entire existence in Mexico...and we never thought it was possible.\" Jhon LeBaron, another relative, posted on his Facebook page that his aunt and another woman were dead. He also posted that six of his aunt's children had been left abandoned, but alive, on a roadside. In a series of tweets Tuesday morning, President Trump hit out at the \"monsters\" who perpetrated the act. TRUMP CALLS FOR 'WAR' AGAINST MEXICAN DRUG CARTEL 'MONSTERS' AFTER AMERICANS MURDERED IN SHOOTOUT \"A wonderful family and friends from Utah got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other, with the result being many great American people killed, including young children, and some missing. If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!\" This combination of frames from Nov. 4, 2019, video by Kenny Miller and posted on the Twitter account of Alex LeBaron shows two views of a burned-out vehicle that was being used by some members of the LeBaron family as they were driving in a convoy near the Sonora-Chihuahua border in Mexico. Mexican authorities say drug cartel gunmen ambushed multiple vehicles, including this one, slaughtering several women and children. (Kenny Miller/Courtesy of Alex LeBaron via AP) He added in a third tweet: \"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!\" President Andrés Manuel López Obrador refused that approach, saying at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\" \"We declared war, and it didn't work,\" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. \"That is not an option.\" Early reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but there was a run-in with the cartel 10 years ago when two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered. BOTCHED CAPTURE OF EL CHAPO'S SON STEMMED FROM US WARRANT; DRUG LORD'S FAMILY TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS' FAMILIES Mexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following \"the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.\" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more. According to Langford Jr.’s Facebook post, one of the older boys in the group managed to escape with six of his siblings from the ongoing shootout and run back to his home at La Mora settlement. He said he left other children who were injured hidden on the side of the road. It was unclear how many children were ultimately rescued as of Monday evening. Many of the church's members were born in Mexico and thus have dual U.S. citizenship. The three SUVs left Bavispe and were traveling on the outskirts of Sonora, near the neighboring state of Chihuahua, when they were reportedly attacked. Claudia Pavlovich Arellano, the governor from Sonora, tweeted in Spanish her determination to find the killers. \"As a mother, I feel courage, repudiation and deep pain for what cowards did in the mountains between Sonora and Chihuahua,\" she wrote. \"I don't know what kind of monsters dare to hurt women and children. As governor, I will do everything to make sure this does not go unpunished and those responsible pay.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. State Department issued a statement saying, “The safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad is among the Department of State’s top priorities.

TEHRAN -- Iran's president announced on Tuesday that Tehran will begin injecting uranium gas into 1,044 centrifuges, the latest step away from its nuclear deal with world powers since President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord over a year ago. IRAN ANNOUNCES NEW NUKE DEAL VIOLATIONS The development is significant as the centrifuges previously spun empty, without gas injection, under the landmark 2015 nuclear accord. It also increases pressure on European nations that remain in the accord, which at this point has all but collapsed. In his announcement, President Hassan Rouhani did not say whether the centrifuges, which are at its nuclear facility in Fordo, would be used to produce enriched uranium. The centrifuges would be injected with the uranium gas as of Wednesday, Rouhani said. His remarks, carried live on Iranian state television, came a day after Tehran's nuclear program chief said the country had doubled the number of advanced IR-6 centrifuges in operation. There was no immediate reaction from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog now monitoring Iran's compliance with the deal. Rouhani stressed the steps taken so far, including going beyond the deal's enrichment and stockpile limitations, could be reversed if Europe offers a way for it to avoid U.S. sanctions choking off its crude oil sales abroad. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The centrifuges at Fordo are IR-1s, Iran's first-generation centrifuge. The nuclear deal allowed those at Fordo to spin without uranium gas, while allowing over 5,000 at its Natanz facility to enrich uranium.",

FILE: Workers walk by the perimeter fence of what is officially known as a vocational skills education center in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China September 4, 2018. (Reuters) Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported Friday that China has been running a “Pair Up and Become Family” program since 2017 where Communist Party officials stay in Uighur homes. Officials said the program promotes “ethnic unity,” but also lets the government monitor the minority population. Party officials who are called “relatives” (but not actually related) visit Uighur families every two months, stay for up to a week, and in some reported instances, share a bed with the women, RFA reported. “They help [the families] with their ideology, bringing new ideas,” an official told the outlet. “They talk to them about life, during which time they develop feelings for one another.” He added, “Normally one or two people sleep in one bed, and if the weather is cold, three people sleep together.” China’s embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., tweeted that the report was “absolutely repulsive.” “It’s difficult to imagine a more intimate form of political violence against an already terrorized minority,” she wrote. “The United States must speak out about the systemized enslavement and attempted cultural obliteration of the Uyghurs.” Information about supposed detention camps is scarce, given that Uighurs face imprisonment for speaking with journalists or anyone outside the region.
