    "title": "Catalan Independence Impasse Cannot Be Resolved Without ‘Crisis in the Spanish State’",
    "description": "As pro-independence protests in Catalonia swell once more, the issue will have increasingly large reverberations through Spanish society, manifesting in a polarization between Catalan and Spanish nationalists as Spaniards grow weary of the perennial problem, a journalist in Barcelona told Sputnik.",
    "articleText": "Barcelona police told Reuters Friday that the massive march swelled to more than half a million people. “You can’t hear the formal part of the demonstration,” Dick Nichols, the correspondent for Spain and Catalonia for Green Left Weekly, told Radio Sputnik’s Loud and Clear Friday, noting the march was “not really a demonstration - it’s an occupation of Barcelona.” “They said, ‘Oh, we’ll have this demonstration on Barcelona’s main avenue, the Passeig de Gràcia,’ but there’s so many people that they couldn’t fit them all in - obviously they couldn’t fit them in unless it spread all around the center of the city,” he told hosts Brian Becker and John Kiriakou. https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/hundreds-of-thousands-protest-against-ca “This is the result of three huge marches that came down from provincial cities, which were much bigger than anybody anticipated,” he said, noting it was a measure of “just how angry people are with this court decision.” Protests were sparked in the northeastern Spanish province of Catalonia five days ago when the Spanish Supreme Court handed down stiff prison sentences for nine of 12 Catalan officials who participated in the botched 2017 attempt to force the issue of independence from Spain by holding a referendum in Catalonia - the anniversary of which passed just days earlier. The officials were found guilty of treason, rebellion and misuse of public funds, with nearly 100 years of jail time split between them. Since then, marches have grown larger and more militant, with 128 people arrested and 62 injured since Monday. A strong national identity has driven Catalan autonomy for centuries, with Catalonians speaking a different language than the rest of Spain - closely related to Occitian just across the border in France - and being able to look back on their region’s legacy as the independent Kingdom of Aragon, which only united with the rest of Spain into a single kingdom thanks to a convenient marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1474. Nichols said his impression was that the court’s decision “marked a turning point. It means that a lot of people who were - not pro-independence, but were certainly in favor of a Catalan right to self-determination - will now move into the independence camp. And it means that people who were democrats, but not at all supportive of Catalan nationalism, will move across into the camp of those who support self-determination.” Nichols said he saw shopkeepers in his neighborhood close their businesses for the day in order to march whom he’d never seen participate in a march before. “This will be the main theme and the biggest crisis in Spanish politics - and it will be the main theme of the Spanish election on November 10.” © REUTERS/ REUTERS TV An aerial views shows the \"March For Freedom\" arriving in Barcelona during Catalonia's general strike, Spain, October 18, 2019. In the rest of Spain, however, Nichols identified two movements. The Spanish nationalists, who view Catalan nationalism as a threat to Spanish national unity, he said would “produce a shift to the right” and a stronger vote for Vox, the neo-fascist party that harkens back to the days of the Francisco Franco dictatorship, which sought to destroy Catalan national identity completely. At the same time, there is a strengthening of support for a political solution in Catalonia among people who realized “this cannot go on forever,” Nichols said. “The EU is praying … just hoping this will go away,” Nichols said, “and they just repeat this line from Madrid that the court trial was done properly, that it was a meticulous example of the application of the justice system. There’s already been a fissure in the British Parliament, where the acting foreign minister got up and repeated that line, the European commissioner in charge of foreign affairs repeated that line, but the sentiment, even inside the national parliaments of the European Union, is becoming more and more pro-Catalan.” “A little indicator here is that La Monde ... which has always been strongly anti-an idea of a Catalan independence, came out in an editorial a couple of days ago saying something has got to be done: the Spanish government just can’t go on refusing to treat this politically. And that’s them getting nervous about the impact the whole Catalan question will have on the European Union as presently structured,” he said. Nichols noted the protests were so big, the “El Clasico” football match between clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona had to be moved and postponed - an almost unthinkable decision, according to some media outlets. “That’s an indication of the nervousness of the powers that be,” he said. “I would expect there to be ongoing mobilizations, demonstrations, protests up until at least the 10th of November,” Nichols said, describing the cat-and-mouse game played by organizers and the authorities trying to shut down their websites and networks online. “It can’t be resolved until there is a crisis in the Spanish state,” Nichols said, noting that meant “a split in the Spanish establishment, which starts to put, for example, the more moderate Patriot block against the really extreme unconditional Spanish unity block. And we’re not at that stage yet. For that to happen, there will have to be continuing mobilizations here, there will have to be a reflection of that inside the Spanish state, in a growth of sentiment that ‘we can’t let this go on.’” “An indicator will be, to help answer that question, the result of the elections,” he said, noting they would likely yield increased polarization between the two extreme camps of unity and independence. “After that, we can probably have a bit more of an intelligent discussion about what’s likely to happen.” The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "Madinah Brown, a Muslim woman who lives in Delaware, has accused her employer of ordering her not to wear her hijab to work.",
    "articleText": "Brown, who works at the New Castle County Detention Center, has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency responsible for dealing with workplace discrimination cases. The complaint states that Brown applied to work at the center in October 2011. Before her interview, her friend, who had experience working at a state correctional facility, told her not to wear her hijab to the interview. However, Brown decided to wear her hijab and was declined the position. Two months later, she reapplied for the same position at the detention center, this time forgoing a hijab for the interview, and she was awarded the position. She started working at the detention center in February 2012. In 2014, Brown wore her hijab to work and was told by one of her supervisors she could not wear it for “safety reasons.” Even though Brown agreed to modify her hijab to be detachable to address security concerns, her supervisors did not approve the garment. “Delaware was required to accommodate Ms. Brown’s sincerely held religious beliefs, unless doing so would impose undue hardship. Wearing a hijab does not pose an undue burden. Delaware prohibited Ms. Brown from wearing a hijab because they stated it posed a security and safety risk. Yet, Ms. Brown proposed a solution that would mitigate the potential safety hazards Delaware cited, with no cost to Delaware,” the report states. In August, when Brown had issues with the metal detector at the facility, a supervisor yelled at her, “Now you’re looking like a terrorist” in front of other employees. It is unclear if Brown was wearing a hijab during this incident. \"This is a clear example of religious discrimination and the state of Delaware has no basis from preventing Madinah from working with her hijab on,\" Zanah Ghalawanji, an attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), is quoted as saying by Delaware Online. CAIR is representing Brown. According to the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families, which supervises the detention center, its actions toward Brown were not an attempt at stifling “religious freedoms.” \"We must carefully balance our strong support of religious freedom with the need to keep youth and staff safe,\" the statement reads. \"In some instances, a person's job may require them to do certain actions, such as the physical restraint of a youth, that makes wearing some religious clothing unsafe.\"",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Terming India’s freedom struggle icon Mahatma Gandhi “racist”, students of a British university have launched an anti-Gandhi public campaign.",
    "articleText": "In a bid to oppose a proposal, approved by the local authorities, to construct a Mahatma Gandhi statue outside Manchester Cathedral in the city, the students from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom have launched a ‘Gandhi Must Fall’ drive. The students’ union of the university, in an open letter to the Manchester City Council, the local authority of the UK city, have asked it to review its decision to allow construction of a nine-feet bronze sculpture of Gandhi, who is remembered for his non-violent approach to take on British rule in India and his anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. The protest has been lodged on the grounds of “Gandhi’s well-documented anti-black racism”. “Gandhi referred to Africans as savages, half-heathen natives, uncivilised, dirty and like animals, to reference only a few of his vile comments,\" an Indian media agency reported, citing the content of the letter. The letter further states that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government in India is covering up human rights abuses in the country in Gandhi’s name and trying to erect his statues to build India’s image as an anti-imperialist state. The students’ union, led by its Liberation and Access Officer Sara Khan, has demanded the city council withdraw the permission. “We demand that Manchester City Council refuse to be complicit in this, especially given the city’s history of anti-racist action, and to stand in solidarity with Manchester’s Black and Kashmiri communities (people from the Indian State which recently lost autonomy and was merged with the Indian Union),” demands the letter titled ‘Gandhi Must Fall’.",

    "description": "The daughter of world-famous writer and publisher Stan Lee, who was responsible for the creation of iconic superheroes such as Spider-Man, X-Men, Thor, Iron Man, Black Panther and The Fantastic Four, has been involved in a series of legal spats regarding her father's former companies since his passing in 2018.",
    "articleText": "The company Stan Lee founded is now battling the late Marvel legend's daughter and sole heir for the rights to his extremely valuable name, likeness, and ideas, according to TMZ on Friday. Stan Lee Entertainment (SLE) claims that it is suing Joan Celia Lee for trying to capitalise on her father's legacy without the legal right to do so, despite being the only heir to his fortune, claiming she has failed to protect SLE's legal hold on its right to Stan's intellectual property. The company also accused POW! Entertainment, another media production company partly set up by Lee, for \"interloping\" or attempting to \"loot SLE's intellectual property.\" The company claims that as a trustee for the Lee Family Survivor's Trust, Joan has a \"duty to vindicate the rights\" of SLE against organisations like POW! trying to steal her father's ideas. SLE are asking the court to force Joan to uphold her signatory to the trust and defend SLE against POW! and other entities as well as a declaration that SLE is the rightful owner of Stan's creations. The company Stan Lee founded in 1998, which is an animation publishing and entertainment company, was given full legal rights to his name, likeness, ideas, characters, stories, logos, and more, effectively rendering the entirety of Lee's legacy, even his ideas, to SLE. After her father's death, Joan began a lawsuit against POW! Entertainment in September of this year following reports of elder abuse by Lee's former manager, Keya Morgan, who has since been arrested on the charge. The complaint states \"By this lawsuit, Stan Lee's heir and Estate seek to perform the covenant Stan Lee made with his namesake company and remedy the wrongs inflicted by trusted business associates over the last two decades.\" \"It is intended to restore the rights he assigned to the namesake company he founded when he was liberated from a 60-year career with Marvel Comics, the comic book company he founded and creatively directed to become the preeminent Superhero entertainment company in the world.\" The suit continues to accuse Gill Champion and Arthur Lieberman for allegedly \"misleading\" Lee into reassigning rights \"on no less than 6 occasions.\" \"When Stan Lee died in November 2017, his daughter, as his only heir and Trustee of his Estate, gathered a forensic team of lawyers and accountants to investigate the facts surrounding the actions of Stan Lee's supposed partners with whom Lee had stopped communicating during the last year of his life.\" \"In so doing, it was learned the extent to which the rights to Stan Lee's intellectual property had been looted, muddied and entangled by POW! and a range of bad actors enabled by POW!\" The Marvel comics creator had himself dropped a $1 billion lawsuit against POW! for using his name and likeness before he passed away in November 2018 at the age of 95. Lee also entered into a legal battle with Stan Lee Entertainment for the rights to iconic superheroes such as Iron Man and Thor in 2011, after numerous bi-coastal lawsuits throughout which the company claimed it had been assigned Stan Lee's intellectual property in 1998, months before his deal with Marvel Entertainment.",

    "title": "Russia's Response to NATO Bases Will Not be Limited to Political Steps - Medvedev",
    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Moscow will respond politically and \"in the military sense\" to NATO's drive to deploy military bases near the Russian borders as it threatens the country's national security, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said.",
    "articleText": "\"No one denies that Russia has own interests related to ensuring its security. We are a large country, we are a nuclear state, and the desire to place NATO bases in our immediate vicinity obviously cannot fill us with positive emotions,\" Medvedev said in an interview with the Serbian newspaper Vecernje Novosti (Evening News) on the eve of his visit to Belgrade. \"We have always responded and will continue to respond to this, both politically and in a military sense,\" he stressed. Medvedev also said that attempts to drag countries with internal conflicts into NATO are dangerous and fraught with very serious consequences. “All attempts to drag countries with internal conflicts into NATO are extremely dangerous. You mentioned Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska, but we can also name other countries. What is happening to Georgia? What is happening to Ukraine? Those countries are in a difficult situation,\" Russian Prime Minister said. \"And secondly, this is fraught with very serious consequences. Therefore, the NATO member states should think a hundred times before making such decisions,\" Medvedev stressed. Russian Prime Minister also said that ideas of creation of some new alliances or states in the Balkans are dangerous because they lead to nationalist circles pursuing their goals using arms, adding that violence should not be allowed to re-emerge in the region. In the interview, Medvedev reiterated Russia’s position on Kosovo based on the need to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia. Russia is convinced that any discussions on this issue should be based on international law, not unilateral moves, according to the prime minister. \"Ideas to create various new alliances and states are very dangerous. Because they eventually make the most aggressive and the most nationalist oriented circles pursue their objectives using violence and arms, and there is already enough of it there. I believe these statements are very dangerous. The processes that are underway must be monitored,\" Medvedev said when asked to comment on whether the situation in the Balkans, given the recognition of Kosovo by multiple western countries, may lead to the creation of the so-called Greater Albania. Medvedev noted, however, the \"pressure coming from Pristina,\" recalling that ultranationalist had recently come to power in Kosovo. \"I believe that all the developments should be thoroughly monitored because it is obvious that the Balkans remain a rather unstable region and we should not allow any repetition of manifestation of acts of violence, attempts to unilaterally redraw the map of the Balkans or any other actions that could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe,\" Medvedev insisted. Dmitry Medvedev also said that the United States in its drive to dominate the world brings harm to Europe, the European countries are already tired of these US aspirations. \"The United States only likes the ideas that are born in the offices of the White House and the Department of State in Washington, DC, it likes only those ideas that ultimately lead to the economic well-being of the United States,\" Medvedev said. \"They [the Americans] promote these ideas by all means, this is not a secret, this is the main course of the United States States of America. Hence, they claim that Russia supports one side or another, or is doing some sort of harm,\" the prime minister said. \"But in fact, it is precisely these US aspirations to dominate the whole world, including the Balkans and Europe, that cause the main harm. By the way, Europe itself is tired of these aspirations, or these desires,\" he stressed. Russian Prime Minister also said that Russia, unlike the United States with its unstoppable desire for dominance, takes a balanced position and strives to build normal relations with all countries regardless of their membership in military blocs. “This is an unstoppable, absolutely unrestrained [US] desire to dominate the world, including Europe. In this sense, we have always taken, in my opinion, a balanced position. That is we want to be friends with all countries, and, of course, we have normal relations with the states that are located in the Balkans, regardless of their membership in a particular military-political bloc,\" Medvedev said.",

    "description": "Students and other community members are rallying around a former Wisconsin high school security guard who was fired earlier this week after defending himself against and verbally reprimanding a student using racist language, a move directly in conflict with the school’s zero-tolerance racial slur policy.",
    "articleText": "Marlon Anderson, a Madison West High School security guard, was terminated from his job on Wednesday following an October 9 verbal dispute with a student who hurled a number of racial insults. In an October 16 interview with Madison 365, a news outlet also located in the school’s city of Madison, Wisconsin, Anderson revealed that the interaction began after he saw Assistant Principal Jennifer Talarczyk escorting a student out of the school building. The security guard said he only attempted to intervene after the teen forcefully removed Talarczyk’s hand from his shoulder. Once Anderson approached, the student unleashed a barrage of profanity-laced insults and racial slurs, including the n-word. Both Anderson and the teen are black. The security guard recounted that he merely responded verbally to the situation and said things such as “don’t call me that, don’t call me the n-word, and don’t call me n****r.” Talarczyk, who is white, reportedly instructed Anderson to “back off” and “tap out,” while not acknowledging the student’s language toward him. The security guard told Madison 365 that he also believes the assistant principal deliberately used his radio to make the situation appear as if he was at fault. “I have a radio too, so I could hear myself saying, ‘Don’t call me that word,'” he said. “And it made me kind of look at her like, wow, she’s just targeting me. She’s just trying to set me up. That was going through my head. So I finished that sentence, ‘Stop calling me the n-word,’ and she’s still saying, ‘You need to step back, you need to back off.’” Come Monday evening, Anderson was called to appear before the Madison Metropolitan School District’s (MMSD) school board for a hearing. A number of supporters from the community were in attendance to vouch for the security guard. “Because I didn’t accept it and tried to correct the behavior with hopes of a restorative conversation, I got fired,” Anderson told WKOW earlier this week. Anderson said he was not aware of his termination until Wednesday afternoon - around the same time parents were sent an email containing vague details about the situation. “I’m writing to inform you of a serious incident that occurred at [Madison] West High School last week. The incident involves a staff member using a racial slur with students. We have investigated the incident, and the staff member will not return to West,” the statement read. Despite the school board’s handling of the situation, a petition, entitled “An Inequitable District,” was created on Anderson’s behalf to get Madison West High and the board to rehire him. WKOW reported that Noah Anderson, Marlon’s son and a student of Madison West High, staged a walkout and march to the Doyle Administrative Building, which contains the offices of MMSD administrators, on Friday. The demonstration followed a Thursday statement from School Board President Gloria Reyes which said that the board planned to review its “underlying policies” and approach to events such as the one Anderson was involved in. According to the outlet, the teacher’s union has also backed Anderson and is calling for him to not only be reinstated, but also receive back pay. Madison 365 noted that this is not the first time a school employee has been terminated, or resigned after being reprimanded, for their use of racial slurs, despite none of them being directed at students. The school has reportedly lost several teachers and other staff members due to its zero-tolerance policy for such language. Though it’s unclear whether the school district will offer Anderson his job, the county’s Boys and Girls Club chapter has offered the former security guard a managerial role and matched his former salary. “We wanted to give him a soft landing,” the club’s CEO Michael Johnson told Madison 365 on Friday. “He seems like he is loved. We’ll respect him and we’ll use his talent at the Boys and Girls Club.”",

    "title": "‘Queen of Warmongers’: Tulsi Gabbard Slams Hillary Clinton Over Russian ‘Grooming’ Claims",
    "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard fired back at 2016 failed presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Friday, hours after news surfaced that Clinton had implied that Russians were “grooming” the Hawaii representative ahead of the 2020 election.",
    "articleText": "Wasting no time at all, Gabbard went straight for the jugular by calling Clinton “the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.” “From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why,” Gabbard tweeted. “Now we know - it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.” “It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly,” she added. Gabbard fired back at Clinton after reports surfaced that Clinton had appeared on David Plouffe’s podcast, “Campaign HQ,” earlier this week, and had taken the opportunity to offer her take on the current political climate, which included Clinton implying that Gabbard was being “groomed” by Russians “[The Russians are] also going to do third-party [candidate] again, and I'm not making any predictions, but I think they got their eye on someone who’s currently in the Democratic primary, and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She’s a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,” Clinton said, referring to Gabbard before suddenly taking a swing at 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. “And that’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she’s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she’s a Russian asset - I mean, totally. They know they can’t win without a third-party candidate. So I don’t know who it’s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.” Gabbard being referred to as a Russian favorite isn’t exactly a new claim; in fact, earlier this week, the presidential contender slammed both CNN and the New York Times at the Ohio Democratic debate for making such allegations. “Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying I am a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,” Gabbard told viewers. “This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia.” “Completely despicable,” she stressed. When Clinton’s camp was asked to confirm whether she was indeed referring to Gabbard in her remarks on Plouffe’s podcast, spokesperson Nick Merrill responded, “If the nesting doll fits.” \"This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,\" Merrill went on. \"If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\" It should be noted that Gabbard has previously ruled out running as a third-party candidate. With the tea being spilt on the internet, netizens were very much present for the tit-for-tat. — stapet - in the great white north (@petsta) October 18, 2019 — Lord Commander (@MitchLeeD763) October 18, 2019 — Blake (@realBlakeBeye) October 18, 2019 — Colin Moriarty (@notaxation) October 18, 2019 — Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) October 18, 2019 However, not to be out done, Merrill later reacted to Gabbard’s response with a simple, “Assad day for your candidacy.”",

    "description": "The 160-mile-long Garlock fault that runs northeast-southwest along the Mojave Desert in Southern California has begun moving for the first time on record, according to a study published Thursday by Caltech scientists and based on new satellite radar images.",
    "articleText": "“This is surprising, because we’ve never seen the Garlock fault do anything. Here, all of a sudden, it changed its behavior,” lead author of the study Zachary Ross, an assistant professor of geophysics at Caltech, is quoted as saying by the Los Angeles Times. “We don’t know what it means.” According to the scientists, a portion of the fault has shifted about 0.8 inches since July, when two earthquakes took place in the region. The 6.4-magnitude tremor that struck 122 miles northeast of Los Angeles on July 4 was followed one day later by a powerful 7.1-magnitude earthquake that caused a fissure within the Little Lake fault zone in Southern California’s Indian Wells Valley area. The earthquakes in July, which involved other crisscrossing faults, are believed to have strained the Garlock fault. \"It's going to force people to think hard about how we quantify seismic hazard and whether our approach to defining faults needs to change,\" Ross said, the Washington Post reported. \"We can't just assume that the largest faults dominate the seismic hazard if many smaller faults can link up to create these major quakes.\" The fact that the Garlock fault has shifted is unnerving, given that it’s located in an area that can produce magnitude 8 quakes. According to the Los Angeles Times, it’s difficult to predict whether an earthquake along that fault will soon occur. However, if it does, it is likely to affect the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita, Lancaster, Palmdale, Ventura, Oxnard and Bakersfield, as well as Kern County, which is an important area for agriculture and oil production.",

    "title": "Pilot Banned for Life After Allowing Egyptian Actor to 'Drive the Plane'",
    "description": "Mohamad Ramadan is an Egyptian actor and singer who has appeared on numerous TV shows and movies in Egypt as well as becoming an internet sensation in January 2019 following the release of his hit-song Mafia.",
    "articleText": "The Egyptian government has issued a lifetime ban to a pilot for allowing celebrity and actor Mohamed Ramadan to enter and sit in the cockpit during a flight to Saudi Arabia, the BBC reported on Friday. \"After confirming the violations against the Egyptian civil aviation law, we have taken deterrent measures towards the reckless and irresponsible actions [of the pilot]\", Egypt's civil aviation ministry said in a statement, reported by Egypt's Masrawy news. The ministry added that aviation safety for Egyptian airliners was of paramount importance. The actor and singer uploaded a video on 13 October to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him walking along the aisle and then sitting in the co-pilot's seat. Speaking to the camera, he says: \"In a first of its kind, I will go drive the plane.\" The footage quickly cuts to him entering the cockpit and shows him taking hold of the controls, as someone else declares that the actor was now driving the planing. An unknown person speaks off camera, saying \"I swear to God, Mohamed Ramadan is the one driving the plane now\". Ramadan, who has over 7 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, uploaded the video of the rule breaking for the world to see. Egyptian aviation rules explicitly forbid passengers from entering the cockpit while a flight is in operation and officials have said that the chief executive of the company in charge of the flight, Smart Aviation, had resigned from his position. The co-pilot has also reportedly been banned for a year. ☝🏽🇪🇬✈️🇸🇦 #موسم_الرياض 👌😉 pic.twitter.com/tFjbSa7eQ6 — Mohamed Ramadan (@Mohamed_Ramadan) October 13, 2019 The video saw serious criticism from Twitter users, with one asking others to \"imagine\" if the celebrity had mistakenly been responsible for a crash and others demanding a boycott of the actor. كل اللي فرحانين اوي!! تخيل نفسك علي نفس الرحلة دي و النمبر زيرو ده ضغط علي زر واحد بس بالخطأ عن جهل منه و كان سبب في سقوط الطائرة لا قدر الله!! كنت هتبقي مبسوط اوي انك مت مع النمبر بتاع ده؟! دي ارواح ناس يا عالم!!! افهموا!!!😡😡😡 — Tamer Sedky (@tsedky73) October 13, 2019 Ramadan responded on his Twitter account, claiming that the plane was private and a not a passenger plane, therefore no one else was at risk of being harmed. Ramadan has made appearances in numerous Egyptian films and several TV series, and was said to be travelling to a concert at an entertainment festival in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The 31-year-old actor also made a name for himself with his hit song Mafia, receiving over 158 million views on YouTube. Despite his expansive support base, Ramadan has drawn controversy to himself before. In August, demands were made to ban the singer from perfoming after he was criticised for wearing a see-through shirt and dancing \"provocatively\" at a concert. He was also accused of being insensitive for posting photos of two luxury cars he'd bought, as a significant portion of his fan-base comes from low income backgrounds.",

    "description": "Following the publication by Project Veritas of videos of secretly recorded CNN executives discussing their network’s prioritization of anti-Trump coverage, US President Donald Trump’s campaign has threatened the network with legal action. In a Wednesday letter, Trump attorney Charles Harder accused CNN of violating the Lanham Act.",
    "articleText": "Earlier this week, conservative “guerrilla journalism” outlet Project Veritas published its latest batch of surreptitiously recorded videos showing CNN executives bragging about their left-leaning bias as they prioritize anti-Trump news items in daily editorial meetings. Now, Trump’s legal counsel claims the network violated the Lanham Act “by constituting misrepresentations to the public, to your advertisers, and to others” to distribute “truly fair and balanced” news. \"Your own employees appear to state that CNN is focused on trying to 'take down President Trump,' driven by a 'personal vendetta' that Mr. Zucker purportedly has against him, rather than reporting the news in an objective manner,\" Harder wrote in a four-page letter to CNN, referring to CNN President Jeff Zucker. \"In the Footage, your employees appear to state that CNN attempts to make its reporting appear neutral and unbiased, when in fact its reporting is far from neutral and highly biased against the President.\" “Accordingly, my clients intend to file legal action against you, to seek compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, reimbursement of legal costs, and all other available legal and equitable remedies, to the maximum extent permitted by law,” Harder notes. The potentially damning footage was recorded by now-former CNN employee Cary Poarch, who told Fox News’ “Hannity” on Monday that he made the recordings because the network was “pumping out propaganda.” Poarch left CNN as a result of the recordings. In one of the videos of a morning editorial meeting, Zucker torpedoes a “really good and important story” about the Department of Homeland Security in order to make room for more anti-Trump coverage. “I don’t think we should move on from shooting migrants at the border in the legs and considering having, you know, alligators and snakes in the moat,” Zucker tells his staff in the video. “I know there is 7,000 impeachment stories and I’m the one that’s saying we should just stay on impeachment, but when … a story of this magnitude comes up and you can objectively say, 'You’re out of your mind,' you should do it and say, 'You’re out of your mind,'\" referring to Trump and ways to ridicule him. “Even though we’re totally left-leaning … we don’t want to admit it,” a man identified by Project Veritas as CNN Field Operations Manager Patrick Davis says to Poarch in another video. “We could be so much better than what we are … we’re supposed to be middle of the road.” In another clip, a man identified as Floor Manager Mike Brevna tells him, “It’s the Trump Network, dog. It’s like everything is all Trump. They not even thinking about it, they not even thinking about anybody else … It’s so sad, because there’s so much news going on out there, but they don’t cover none of it.” “Jeff Zucker, basically the president of CNN, has a personal vendetta against Trump… it’s not gonna be positive for Trump. [Zucker] hates him. He’s going to be negative,” a person identified by Project Veritas as CNN Media Coordinator Nick Neville says. \"The aforementioned examples are merely the tip of the iceberg of the evidence my clients have accumulated over recent years,\" continues Harder in the Wednesday letter. \"We also expect substantial additional information about CNN’s wrongful practices to become known in the coming days and weeks.” “Never in the history of this country has a President been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called 'mainstream' news, as the current situation,” Harder wrote. “Statements like ‘excellence in journalism,’ ‘most trusted source for news and information,’ ‘commitment to the truth and to facts’ and ‘truly fair and balanced’ are statements that would be widely considered throughout the journalism community and news industry as journalism that complies with industry-accepted codes of ethics, including the Society for Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics.” Trump has pointedly derided CNN over the years as “Fake News” and as being guilty of “unfair reporting.” In one incident last November, he infamously revoked CNN White House Correspondent Jim Acosta’s press pass after Acosta aggressively pressed the president during a press conference, refusing to surrender the microphone. Acosta’s pass was restored two weeks later, and he later wrote a book about Trump titled “Enemy of the People” before resigning in July. CNN’s Friday response was laconic: \"This is nothing more than a desperate PR stunt and doesn't merit a response,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.",

The Indian Air Force, however, allowed women to assume fighter positions in 2016 and inducted women fighter pilots. The Indian Navy is also considering the idea of deploying women on warships.",
    "articleText": "Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has given his go-ahead to admit girls in army schools across the country to ensure greater participation of women in the armed forces. The minister has directed concerned authorities to ensure the availability of necessary infrastructure and sufficient female staff in Sainik (army) schools for the smooth implementation of the directive. The admission of girl children in Sainik schools will commence from the 2021-22 academic session in a phased manner. The decision came in the wake of the successful pilot project started by the Ministry of Defence for the admission of girl children in Sainik School Chhingchhip in the northeastern state of Mizoram two years ago. “The decision is in line with the objective of the Government towards greater inclusiveness, gender equality, enabling greater participation of women in Armed Forces and strengthening the motto of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’(Save Girls, Teach Girls), propagated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” the Ministry of Defense said in a statement. Currently, women are allowed in select areas such as the medical, legal, educational, signals and engineering wings of the Army. Nevertheless, the Indian Army had taken a decision to induct 800 women combatants in the military police in a phased manner in 2018.",

All three were picked up from a call centre on Thursday evening, Indian news agency PTI cited a Cyber Crime Cell police official as saying. Police also confirmed they had seized six hard discs, one pen drive and other incriminating documents during their raid at the call centre. The arrested persons are being interrogated under various sections of the Information Technology Act to find out if others persons are involved. Police said they acted upon a complaint filed from a New Delhi resident. The complaint stated several persons from Kolkata were allegedly duping people by falsely promising them technical support from Microsoft. Following a probe, three arrests were made. Earlier this month, Delhi Police had busted 10 fake call centres following a complaint that a few people were duping customers of Microsoft by posing as employees of the US-based technology giant. Delhi Police Special Cell arrested 24 people, the Indian daily Financial Express reported then.

The film follows the royal couple across the continent and shines a light on their reactions to the media barrage they have experienced since the birth of their baby, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.",
    "articleText": "Meghan Markle has admitted that she is “not ok” in a rare emotional interview in a clip from a behind-the-scenes documentary called “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey”, released early on Sunday. She reveals in the interview with Tom Bradby for the ITV programme about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which airs at 9pm on Sunday, that this past year has been “really challenging” for her. \"Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you’re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn – you know\", she said in response to being asked if she is ok. \"And especially as a woman, it’s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it’s, well…\" she added. Meghan then thanked the interviewer for asking and continued: \"And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I’m ok. But it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\" When asked again if she it's fair to say she is not ok, Meghan simply responds with \"Yes\". \"Not many people have asked if I’m ok ... it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\" Meghan reveals how the intense media spotlight has left her struggling to cope while becoming a mom. #CreatedKnots #MeghanMarkle pic.twitter.com/T0BUUepvRL — Created Knots Media (@CreatedKnots) October 18, 2019 Markle's comments come as part of a trailer for the ITV documentary, revealing their successful Africa tour, which took the Sussex family around Angola, Botswana, South Africa, and Malawi. The programme follows Meghan, Prince Harry and their baby Archie over their 10-day royal tour across the continent last month and promises to “explain a lot” as Meghan reveals on all about the pressures they've been under. In a one-to-one interview, Meghan was asked about the \"true pressures of life in the spotlight and the toll it has taken on them both\". In one part she speaks candidly on the trip saying \"Oh my goodness, it’s the most inspiring, we just got here and to see everything that they are doing but also that it’s not just the girls that are feeling empowered, it’s all the roles of the men and the young boys who are also helping them\". The visit served as Archie's first royal tour and his first official engagement - meeting Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his family. Meghan and Archie stayed in South Africa while Harry took a solo trip to the remaining countries, before the family reconvened for the end of the trip. The couple have come under immense pressure in recent weeks, with Harry claiming that he was driven to take legal action in response to the “painful” impact of “relentless propaganda” against his wife from newspapers, after the Duke of Sussex launched 2 separate legal proceedings against the Daily Mirror and The Sun over allegations of phone-hacking.",

    "description": "Chinese national Tao Li, 39, was sentenced to 40 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release on October 16 by a US judge for conspiring to illegally export military and space-grade technology to China without a license, which is a violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
    "articleText": "“This case is one of many involving illegal attempts to take US technology to China. Li attempted to procure highly sensitive US military technology in violation of our export control laws. Such laws are in place to protect our national security, and the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously enforce them,” Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers wrote in an October 18 press release by the Justice Department. “We don’t take these crimes lightly and we will continue to pursue them.” Between December 2016 and January 2018, Li exported radiation-hardened power amplifiers and supervisory circuits from the US to China. The technology is usually used in military and space applications and thus requires an export license provided by the US Department of Commerce before being shipped out of the US. During the same timeframe, Li, who was then living in China, also used several aliases to contact people at private companies in the US to try to get access to electronic equipment. In one instance, Li “wired money from a bank account in China to a bank account in Arizona,” according to the press release. He was arrested last September at Los Angeles International Airport, when he was traveling from China to Arizona to meet an undercover agent. “Li’s sentencing was the result of a highly successful joint investigative effort with our law enforcement partners and the US Attorney’s Office that prevented US military technology from falling into the wrong hands,” Bryan D. Denny, special agent in charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Western Field Office, is quoted as saying. “It also reaffirms our commitment to protecting America from this type of activity and, equally so, serves as a warning to those intent on illegally exporting our technologies that the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its partners will pursue these crimes relentlessly.” The investigation was carried out by the US Homeland Security Investigations and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.",

    "articleText": "On Thursday, the United States and Turkey reached an agreement to implement a 120-hour ceasefire in northeast Syria to allow the withdrawal of the Kurdish People's Protection Units' (YPG) forces. All military operations under Turkey's Peace Spring will be paused and the operation will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal. “That [the agreement] is important as it can provide a basis for progress and de-escalating the situation. And that is exactly why I welcome the fact that those two allies have agreed [on the ceasefire],” Stoltenberg said at a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He pointed out that all NATO member states were concerned over the situation in northeastern Syria. “The situation in northeast Syria is a concern for all NATO allies and it matters for all NATO allies,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the military operation may deteriorate the humanitarian situation in the area and increase the number of refugees. According to the secretary-general, NATO’s main goal in the region is to defeat the Daesh* terror group and next week the alliance’s defence ministers will meet to discuss the issue once again. Turkey launched its offensive in northeastern Syria on October 9 to clear the border area of Kurdish units after President Donald Trump decided to withdraw US troops from the area. Damascus has called the Turkish operation an invasion and deployed its troops to the north of the country.

    "description": "While Bigfoot remains at large, a 6-foot tall, 180-pound Sasquatch statue was found and claimed by a North Carolina sheriff’s office earlier this week in a quite uncommon operation.",
    "articleText": "Officers with the Avery County Sheriff’s Office were excited to inform the public on Wednesday that a previously lifted Bigfoot statue was located and retrieved from a nearby wooded area. According to the department’s October 16 Facebook post, the Bigfoot statue was found in the community of Edgemont by a “very alert young man” named Mike. After he notified the sheriff’s office, police dispatched Chief Detective Frank “Littlefoot” Catalano and additional officers to retrieve the 180-pound figure. The statue, which depicts the less-than-enthused Sasquatch in mid-stride, was unbolted and stolen from Mountaineer Landscaping’s storefront in Linville, North Carolina, back in August, which caused quite the local disturbance. “He’s part of the family,” Mountaineer Landscaping store manager Glenna Ollis told WBTV following the kidnapping, adding that the figure was a big draw for customers. Local resident Teri Brewer confirmed this by gushing over how “lovable” the figure was. Despite the owner’s love of the statue, the sheriff’s office noted they were unable to return the missing figure to the family-owned business because insurance money related to its disappearance was collected during its absence. As a result, Bigfoot now appears to be in the basement of the Avery County Sheriff’s Office until the insurance company decides how it wishes to proceed. Being that the Sasquatch figure has yet to find a new home, netizens have suggested the insurance company auction the statue off and donate the proceeds from the sale to a local charity. Locals were also quick to bring the jokes in the post’s comment section. Facebook user Loretta Elder Travis took a shot at a man from her past and asked, “Is Edgemont on Wilson's Creek? If so I know where THE BIGFOOT lives! I used to date him. He's a real ANIMAL! (Specifically a wild BORE).” “Sasquatch is found when he wants to be found. He became tired walking back from the bigfoot festival in marion,” said Keith McCurry, referencing the annual Bigfoot Festival in Marion, North Carolina. Libby Brown pleaded, “Please don’t lock him up!”",

    "articleText": "A Friday news release from the agency notes that the move was initiated by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), a division of the Commerce Department that handles issues related to national security and enhanced technologies. “This action by the Commerce Department sends another clear message to the Cuban regime – that they must immediately cease their destructive behavior at home and abroad,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement included in the press release. “The Trump Administration will continue to act against the Cuban regime for its misdeeds, while continuing to support the Cuban people and their aspirations for freedom and prosperity.” According to BIS, the restrictive sanctions were prompted after it was discovered that Cuban officials had been transporting tourists on leased airplanes that were subject to BIS' jurisdiction. \"BIS is revoking existing licenses for aircraft leases to Cuban state-owned airlines, and will deny future applications for aircraft leases,\" reads the release. The latest development comes as the Trump administration has continued to overturn Obama-era agreements with the Cuban government. In June, the State Department announced that it would be barring Americans from traveling to Cuba, in addition to prohibiting visits to Cuba via passenger and recreational vessels such as cruise ships. More recently, the US State Department sanctioned former Cuban leader Raul Castro, who now serves as the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, for his alleged involvement in human rights violations.",

    "description": "New satellite photos show the shipyard where China’s new Type 002 aircraft carrier is being built is just part of a massive, kilometer-long naval dock where even more large vessels might be constructed.",
    "articleText": "Commercial satellite imagery taken last month shows that not only is progress continuing on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) third aircraft carrier, but a much larger docking area around the shipyard is being built as well, according to a new report by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Taken on September 18, the satellite photos show a progression of excavation of land, an additional crane and extensive stockpiling of prefabricated ship parts, such as bulkheads, on the southern coast of Shanghai’s Changxing Island, which sits in the Yangtze estuary, when compared with older photos. © Center for Strategic and International Studies Satellite image of the new aircraft carrier assembly facility at Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai According to CSIS’ China Power publication, the photos provide the first chance to make strong estimates of the upcoming ship’s dimensions. While most of the hull remains obscured from aerial visibility by environmental shelters, the exposed bow of the ship tapers from a width of 38 to 34 meters; analysts report the water-level beam of the hull will likely be roughly 40 meters. The ship is being built by Jiangnan Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). Another Shanghai-based CSSC subsidiary, Hudong Zhonghua, recently completed the PLAN’s first Type 075 amphibious assault ship, a 40,000-ton helicopter carrier capable of dispatching thousands of marines and their equipment. © Center for Strategic and International Studies Three satellite photos showing excavation of the new ship basin at Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai CSIS estimates the assembly of the Type 002’s hull will take at least another 12 months. “We can see slow but steady progress on the hull, but I think the really surprising thing these images show is the extensive infrastructure buildup that has gone on simultaneously,” CSIS analyst Matthew Funaiole told Reuters for a Thursday story. Some of the most dramatic contrast between the photos from September and previous images taken in May can be seen in the vast area south of the shipyard (at the top of the images), where excavators have slowly chipped away at a kilometer-long wharf that’s been finally opened to the sea. “It is hard to imagine all this is being done for just one ship,” Funaiole added. “This looks more like a specialized space for carriers and or other larger vessels.” © Center for Strategic and International Studies Satellite imagery showing a large new ship basin and assembly facility at Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai “That they’ve expanded the harbor is no surprise, given that future aircraft carriers will be larger and more complicated – such as being nuclear-powered,” naval expert Li Jie told the South China Morning Post. Li said the PLAN likely requires five or six aircraft carriers to meets its needs in the future. China’s navy has expanded dramatically in the 21st century, increasing from a fleet of 216 ships in 2005 to 335 in 2019, outpacing even the US Navy by 49 vessels, according to a US Congressional Research Service report published earlier this week. That buildup has included not just new carriers, but also advanced missile cruisers like the new Type 055, Type 079 landing platform docks and attack submarines. Funaiole told Reuters the Type 002, the existence of which has been confirmed by Beijing but not by the PLAN, will likely be somewhat smaller than the US Navy’s 100,000-ton supercarriers, but definitely larger than their closest challenger, France’s 42,500-ton Charles de Gaulle. Like both the De Gaulle and Washington’s Nimitz-class and Ford-class carriers, the Type 002 is expected to have a fully flat deck and launch aircraft using catapults. The PLAN’s two present carriers, Liaoning and Type 001a, use a bow ramp to lift planes into the sky. The practice is safer and less sophisticated than catapult launching, but it limits the amount of fuel and munitions the planes can take on missions. The Type 001a, once expected in time for the People’s Republic of China’s 50th anniversary on October 1, began its eighth sea trial earlier this week, which could lead to its commissioning. It is China’s first indigenously designed and built carrier, and when the Type 002 is completed, it will be the second. The PLAN’s two carriers are based in the Yellow Sea port of Dalian. The Pentagon’s annual China Military Power Report to Congress this past May noted that China’s navy “continues to develop into a global force, gradually extending its operational reach beyond East Asia into a sustained ability to operate at increasingly longer ranges.” “China continues to learn lessons from operating its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning,” the Office of the Secretary of Defense told lawmakers in the report. “Its first domestically built aircraft carrier was launched in 2017 and will likely be commissioned in 2019 – the beginning of what the PLA states will be a multi-carrier force. China’s next generation of carriers, including one that began construction in 2018, will have greater endurance and a catapult launch system capable of launching various types of fixed-wing aircraft, including early warning and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft.” “These improvements would increase the striking power of a potential carrier battle group when deployed to areas beyond China’s immediate periphery,” according to the report, which notes the PLAN’s current “modest but growing” ability to project power beyond the “First Island Chain,” Beijing’s name for the Pacific archipelagoes closest to the East Asian coast, including the Kuril Islands, Japanese archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, the Philippines and the South China Sea.",

    "articleText": "Alaska Airlines Flight 3296, which was operated by Peninsula Airways, went off the Unalaska-Dutch Harbor Airport runway at around 5:40 p.m. Thursday. The flight departed from Anchorage and was set to land in Unalaska. — ABC News (@ABC) October 18, 2019 According to Aviation-Safety.net, the aircraft “overran the end of the runway, crossed a road and came to rest on a rocky surface at the edge of the water of Dutch Harbor,” which is located on Amaknak Island in Unalaska. “Propeller blades of the no.1 engine broke off, puncturing the fuselage,” Aviation-Safety.net explained, referring to the main body of the aircraft.

    "description": "An Orange County Sheriff’s Department investigator is now the subject of an internal investigation and has been placed on administrative leave after allegedly brandishing his firearm at a teen during a recent dispute.",
    "articleText": "A dispute over loud music at a San Clemente, California, skate park quickly escalated Saturday evening after an off-duty member of Orange County Sheriff’s Department threatened to shoot a teen “in the f**king face” during a heated confrontation. The off-duty law enforcement official, who has not been identified by the sheriff’s department, is seen in camera footage of the incident approaching and grabbing a teen, who responds by raising a skateboard while backing up. The man then continues to advance toward the boy and attempts to grab him one more time before brandishing what witnesses say was - and appears to be - a firearm. The teen responded by putting his hands in the air and complying with the investigator’s instructions. “The guy thought he was about to hit him with the board, so he pulled out the gun,” Logan Plier, a witness at the skate park, told KTLA. While the investigator did flash his badge, his fingers covered most of the emblem in the recording. Koa McClung, who was at the park with two of his siblings at the time of the incident, told KCBS that he thought the badge was fake, considering how briefly it was shown. McClung added that once the man brandished his weapon, he then said, “I’ll shoot you in the f**king face if you don’t stop.” According to Nathan Scott, another teen who was at the skate park, the situation all started due to the man’s displeasure with a live band that was performing that night. “He’s like, my son can’t focus while playing baseball. Everyone started laughing and making fun of him,” Scott said to KTLA. Despite having made jokes at the man’s expense, witnesses claim they agreed to keep the noise down prior to the escalation. The unnamed investigator has been placed on administrative leave following the incident. “Orange County Sheriff’s Department employees are expected to conduct themselves with professionalism on and off-duty,” the department said in a statement concerning the investigator’s alleged abuse of power. “We take this incident seriously and will fully investigate.” Results of the sheriff’s department’s internal investigation will be handed over to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office upon completion.",

    "description": "Despite the fact that the teacher’s brother and Lady Amelia are not married, Amelia’s sister has allegedly referred to the former as her “big brother” in the past.",
    "articleText": "Fiona Viotti, a now ex-teacher at the Bishops Diocesan College in Cape Town who recently quit her job after allegedly becoming engaged in sexual relations with one of the students, appears to have certain indirect ties to the British nobility with the Daily Mail describing her as “sister-in-law” of Lady Amelia Spencer. According to the newspaper, Fiona’s brother, Greg Mallett, is in a long-term relationship with Amelia, Princess Diana’s niece and daughter of Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer. And while Greg and Lady Amelia are not married, the newspaper claims that the former is considered to be part of the family, and that Lady Kitty Spencer, Amelia’s sister, has referred to Greg as her “big brother” in the past. The scandal involving Fiona erupted when the student she allegedly had a liaison with, turned to his parents, who later informed the headmaster, for help after the woman had refused to end their affair. While the school is currently investigating these allegations, no charges have been pressed yet. Viotti, a former teen water polo star who was featured on Sports Illustrated as one of the \"Beauties of Sport\" ten years ago, is the niece of Nick Mallet who used to be a South African national rugby coach. She married her long-time boyfriend, venture capitalist Pavo Viotti, only last year.",

    "description": "Earlier, the Hawaii congresswoman accused CNN and the New York Times of “despicable” attempts to “smear” her over her opposition to what she described as the US’s “regime-change war” in Syria.",
    "articleText": "Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has accused 2020 Democratic contender Tulsi Gabbard of being “the favourite of the Russians,” appearing to suggest that both Gabbard and former Green Party candidate Jill Stein were ‘Russian assets’. Speaking to Campaign HQ, a 2020 election podcast, Clinton claimed that the Russians have “got their eye on somebody who’s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” apparently referring to Gabbard. “They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her, so far,” the former secretary of state said. “And that’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she’s also a Russian asset,” Clinton, who has blamed Stein, Bernie Sanders, the media, Vladimir Putin, male chauvinists, and others for her dramatic loss against Donald Trump in 2016, added. Gabbard did not immediately respond to Clinton’s claims. However, she did continue her attacks against the 'corporate media' and the DNC on Friday, pointing to alleged unfair treatment of her at the recent debates.

Hillary Clinton Engages In Insane Conspiracy Theory On Tulsi Gabbard https://t.co/N6EANW3QZT — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) 18 октября 2019 г. Clinton’s remarks echoed recent talking points expressed by multiple US media outlets, including CNN and the New York Times, who attacked Gabbard over her alleged status as a “Russian asset” and an “Assad apologist.” Gabbard addressed the media’s “smears” at the latest Democratic debate, calling the claims against herself, an Iraq War veteran, “completely despicable,” and threatening to boycott the next debate. Gabbard has faced flak over her 2017 trip to Syria on a ‘fact-finding’ mission, where she met with Syrian President Bashar Assad, and for multiple comments she has made about needing to end a “dangerous” and expensive “nuclear arms race” with Russia. Clinton’s remarks about Gabbard are the latest in a barrage of US media attacks against the candidate which began in February, when NBC News pointed to alleged overly favourable coverage of the candidate in Russian foreign language media. Gabbard called the media’s attacks an attempt to smear her as a “Kremlin stooge” and to “discredit” her campaign. According to a recent Economist/YouGov survey, Gabbard is currently polling at 3 percent support for the Democratic nomination, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris.",

    "title": "Russia's Mideast Rise, Fading of Pax Americana Presents Threats, Opportunities, Israeli Media Says",
    "description": "Earlier this week, as US troops abandoned positions in northern Syria under the de facto control of local Kurdish forces amid the Turkish onslaught, Russian peacekeeping patrols quietly began operating in Manbij, northern Syria in a bid to prevent fighting between Turkish and Syrian Army forces.",
    "articleText": "The withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria signals a waning of ‘Pax Americana’ in the Middle East, and presents both “dangers” and “opportunities” for Israel in the region, former Israeli intelligence officials, diplomats and lawmakers have told The Times of Israel. According to Amos Yadlin, former head of the Israeli military’s Military Intelligence Directorate, “All pairs of enemies in the Middle East enjoy reasonably good ties with Russia: Saudi Arabia and Iran, Israel and the Palestinians, the Kurds and the Turks, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Turkey, and so on.” Russia, Yadlin said, is not a Middle Eastern ‘hegemon’ in the traditional sense of the term, with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt sharing that title, in his view. Furthermore, he noted, Washington still has far greater forces in the Middle East than Moscow. “The Russian success stems from their ability to use very few forces with determination and rules of engagement that only they can allow themselves, with a veto at the UN Security Council and a patriotic audience at home,” Yadlin said, without elaborating. Former Israeli Ambassador to the US Michael Oren said he found the US disengagement in the Middle East much more concerning than Russia’s growing influence. “We have relied for the last 45 years on a Pax Americana that no longer exists. I am not saying that the US won’t come to our assistance, but we can’t be certain of it anymore,” he said. As for Russia, Oren suggested Israel should work to reach a ‘modus vivendi’ with Moscow. “It’s useless for us to pretend that Russia is going to be an ally, but we don’t have to make them enemies either,” he said. © AP Photo / Susan Walsh In this Monday, March 25, 2019 file photo, President Donald Trump smiles at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, after signing a proclamation in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House in Washington However, Ksenia Svetlova, a former Israeli lawmaker from the Zionist Union Party, said Russia’s rise could have “very grave” implications for Tel Aviv. “We already have Russian air defence systems, the S-300, that cover the Syrian and Lebanese shores. As soon as the Russians think that it’s smart for them to operate these systems and to halt the Israeli attacks, Israel would no longer be able to deal with the extension of Iranian power in these countries,” she said, repeating Tel Aviv’s talking point about alleged growing ‘Iranian influence’ in Syria. Russia initially deployed its air defences only at its airbase in Latakia, northwestern Syria. However, last October, following a friendly fire incident led to the loss of a Russian aircraft and the deaths of 15 Russian airmen, Moscow began deploying S-300s to Syria’s armed forces, complicating Tel Aviv’s campaign of airstrikes into Syria and leading to a reduction in its intensity. © Photo: YouTube/Sputnik Footage of Russian S-300 Missile Systems Being Delivered to Syria According to Svetlova, Iran, another Israeli adversary, was also a Russian ‘strategic ally', and “it’s not likely that Moscow will do anything to curb the Iranian influence in Syria and Lebanon.” But Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst at the Belgium-based nonprofit International Crisis Group, believes Russia could help reduce tensions between Israel and other countries in the region. In his view, President Trump’s Syria exit would at least temporarily end “Israeli wishful thinking about the US resolving all problems militarily,” which could force Israel too to move away from military operations and turn to diplomacy and “some temporary de-facto power-sharing,” including agreements on Syria and Lebanon and perhaps even a “non-aggression pact” between Israel and Hezbollah. © Sputnik / Valery Melnikov L-R: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin US Troops Leave Northern Syria The US withdrew about 1,000 troops from northeast Syria last week, thereby greenlighting a Turkish military operation Ankara says is aimed against Daesh (ISIS)* terrorists and local Kurdish militants, whom Turkish authorities also classify as terrorists. Turkey’s operation brought it broad condemnation from its NATO allies, with the US slapping the country with sanctions. Late Thursday, US Vice President Mike Pence said he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and agreed to a ceasefire in Syria. Amid the Turkish operation, Damascus reached an agreement with Kurdish-led militia forces in northern Syria, allowing Syrian Army forces to advance into Kurdish-controlled areas to mount a joint defence of the Syrian-Turkish border area. This week, Russian peacekeepers began patrols in the city of Manbij in eastern Aleppo province, with the mission aimed at preventing fighting between Syrian and Turkish forces.

    "description": "After securing a deal with the European Union and successfully removing the contentious Irish Backstop from the previous agreement, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson must now secure a victory in the House of Commons with a majority agreeing to support the withdrawal agreement.",
    "articleText": "Labour plans to back an amendment which would force the Prime Minister to request a Brexit extension if a deal has not been agreed to in Parliament by the end of Saturday, according to the Guardian's Heather Stewart. The motion was tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory cabinet minister, on Friday which ensures that when the Commons readies to vote Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement tomorrow, it will be possible for MPs to debate and vote on multiple amendments. The government was defeated by 12 votes on the motion. The amendment would remove the government motion almost entirely confirming that the Commons has approved the Brexit deal and says that Parliament is currently withholding approval of the deal until legislation implementing it has been written into law. Oliver Letwin is proposing an amendment to Boris Johnson's deal that would prevent Boris Johnson's deal from being approved until all of the relevant legislation has been passed (thus preventing us from leaving with No Deal by mistake). From what I understand it could well pass. pic.twitter.com/dFeWyGNBH7 — Stats for Lefties 🌹 🌹 (@LeftieStats) October 18, 2019 Since the amendment was tabled, it has received significant cross-party support, including Labour's Hilary Benn of the Brexit committee, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, and Philip Hammond, the former chancellor of the exchequer under Theresa May. The aim is to close a loophole in the Benn act which Johnson could exploit, that in the event that no withdrawal agreement agreement is passed by the 31 October, the UK would leave without a deal by default. The Letwin amendment forces him to request a Brexit extension if a deal has not been passed by the end of tomorrow, with the provision that if an agreement is made before the end of October, the extension can be revoked. Therefore if the Letwin bill passes tomorrow, the vote on Johnson's deal will not be make-or-break. MPs will instead be voting that they are considering the deal but are withholding approval. This means that, assuming Johnson intends to honour the governments confirmation to the court of session in Scotland earlier this month, he will have to pen a request to the EU for an extension. Johnson's options would then be attempting to get an agreement through on the 31 October or agree to the extension and call the election which Labour has confirmed they will support in that event, campaigning on the basis of implementing his deal. Currently restricting the Prime Minister from leaving without a deal is the Benn act, passed by 29 votes, which prevents no deal being a legal possibility.",

    "description": "These findings were recently published in the Shell Youth Study, a survey established in 1953 to help flesh out the attitudes, values, habits and social behaviours of German young people.",
    "articleText": "One in five Germans between the age of 12 and 25 would not like to have a family of refugees as their neighbours, the 2019 edition of the Shell Youth Study has found. What’s more, 18 percent of study participants said they would have issues with a family of ethnic Turks, 12 percent if it was a family with many children, 9 percent with a gay, lesbian, or transgendered family, and 8 percent with a family of Jews. The study also found differences based on region, with youths in eastern Germany holding more favourable views toward Jewish neighbours, but also less favourable attitudes toward refugees. Nationwide, German citizens tracing their origins in Muslim countries, were said to have been more apprehensive of Jews and persons from the LGBT community, with 14 percent and 18 percent admitting they wouldn’t like to have persons from these groups as neighbours. The Shell Youth Study uses the question about neighbour preference as a means to measure tolerance. Along with social issues, the study asked questions pertaining to politics, ecology, social justice, media preferences, the European Union, liberal and conservative values, nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, family, religion, education, professional aspirations, social standing and leisure. The survey found that some 71 percent of young people consider pollution as their main fear, with terrorist attacks and climate change ranking second and third with 66 percent and 65 percent, respectively. 71 percent of respondents also supported the statement “I don’t think politicians care about what people like me think,” with the study classifying that as a “populist statement.” Differences were also found in the attitudes of youths in western and eastern Germany, with eastern German young people still more likely to desire children than their western counterparts (71 percent compared to 67 percent), and eastern German male and females more less likely to support the concept of the man being the main breadwinner in the household (38 percent and 31 percent compared with 58 percent and 56 percent among western Germans). The 2019 study, the 18th since 1953, surveyed 2,572 young people aged between 12 and 25 in face to face interviews between January and March.",

    "description": "Boris Johnson has returned from Brussels with a deal, something that nobody really believed was possible. Still, the PM has an uphill struggle getting his Brexit deal through Parliament as even some of the most generous estimations have the PM falling 4 votes short of the 320 that is needed to get the deal through the House of Commons.",
    "articleText": "Sputnik spoke on the issue with Dominic Frisby, author of “How Tax has Shaped the Past and Will Change the Future.” Sputnik: First of all, Nigel Farage is pretty vocal in his opposition to Boris Johnson's New Deal. What is your opinion on the deal that he's brought to Parliament? Dominic Frisby: Well, it's not as good as deal is it would have been if Boris had become Prime Minister in 2016. He would have had a parliament, much more behind him. And he would have had much stronger negotiating tools. The mood was very different back then. But under the circumstances, the deal that he's got is pretty good. But I can understand why Nigel isn't happy with it because it's not the clean break that Nigel wants. Under the circumstances, I would probably vote it through if I was in Parliament, but you know, reluctantly, and I do it just just to get to the next stage, but I can sympathize with all Nigel's criticisms. Sputnik: Will he be able to get the deal through the House of Commons? Dominic Frisby: I was looking at the logistics; I think he's going to get it through Parliament. I think the Spartans will go with it for the reasons I just described, to just get to the next level. I think a lot of the anti - 'No Deal' Tory MPs. The 21 guys who had the whip withdrawn, I think some of them will vote for it, because they think they'll stand a better chance that way of being reselected by the party. And I think there's a hardcore of 20 or 30 Labour MPs who will vote for it if they're in leave voting constituencies. So one way or another, I think you'll get it over the line Sputnik: Boris Johnson, when he returned from Europe. There's a sense that he was in a win/win situation. Some people have described it as: if this bill failed to get through, he could then lead the next election campaign for the conservatives with people versus the parliament idea that the parliament was betraying the will of the people. Do you think he's in a win/win situation just now? Dominic Frisby: To have the lack of majority that he has, and to have got where he's got in the time that he's done that is pretty incredible. He has very little power in parliament and he doesn't command a majority. But where he has all the cards, it's quite clear if there was an election tomorrow, IE before October 31. Boris stood on a 'No Deal' ticket or 'A good Deal or No Deal'. I think most Brexit voters would go over to him. The way the seats are around the country, I've looked at the numbers, he'd had something like 370/380 seats in parliament, he'd have a huge majority. But the longer it goes on that, you know, that could change if we were to leave and it didn't work out so well that maybe people might revise their opinions. So that can change but at the moment, he's pretty strong. But if he fudges Brexit, or he can't get Brexit through by October 31, and he tries to present it as people versus the parliament, I think his case is slightly weaker because then the Brexit party will come into play. I should say even though Boris has negotiated a great deal under the circumstances and would have done a better deal in 2016. I would think Nigel Farage would have been even better. I wish Nigel had been negotiating the deal because he knows what goes on. Let's see what happens. But it's really important as this, you know, I guess it's maybe 20, maybe even 25% of the electorate that will swing towards the Brexit party, even as much as 30% and away from the Tories if the Tories don't deliver Brexit. So it's up to Boris, the future of the Tory party is at stake. And I think he needs to kick out the soft middle, he needs to be less David Cameron and more Margaret Thatcher. Sputnik: We've seen the DUP cast aside by Boris Johnson in order to get this deal through. Do you think that could be a long term mistake for the Conservative Party? Dominic Frisby: Oh my goodness me. I mean, I see why he's done it. I feel very sorry for those guys. You know, if you ask me, I'm not actually, I'm not an expert on Ireland. And I really don't feel qualified to talk about Ireland. But I'm not a great 'United Kingdom' person. I always advocate going back to that England should be the Anglo Saxon heptarchy. My dream is to one day, I'm talking slightly tongue in cheek here, to stand for the independent nation of Curnow. I've been Cornwall. So it's the conservative and Unionist is party. I'm not a unionist in the way that the Conservative Party is. But they do seem to be sacrificing Northern Ireland a bit.

    "title": "Trudeau's Liberals Face Uphill Battle in Canada's Heartlands Ahead of Federal Elections",
    "description": "On 21 October voters in Canada’s 338 electoral districts will choose members of the country’s parliament. Sputnik's correspondent went to one of country's three prairie provinces to discuss the campaign with local candidates.",
    "articleText": "The first thing you would hear if you talk about elections in Canada is the word “riding.” It means “electoral district” and in Canada, ridings can be as large as some European countries. Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek constituency in Saskatchewan is almost the size of Belgium, and during this year’s Federal election it has six candidates competing for a seat in the federal legislature. Conservative MP Kelly Block, who won the previous election with 64 per cent of the vote, spent a lot of time on the road door-knocking, while also entertaining her Facebook subscribers with local landmark quizzes. But the campaign in Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek hasn’t been such a scenic ride for Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party candidate Rebecca Malo. \"When I’ve been door-knocking it’s few and far between when I actually meet a fellow liberal,\" Malo says. \"The most common response is either \"I’m voting conservative\" or they don’t vote at all.\" Malo is a university student who campaigned while preparing for her midterm exams and arrived for the Sputnik interview with her mom - also a Trudeau supporter. The main reason for Malo becoming a liberal candidate is because she personally benefits from programmes introduced by Trudeau’s party. The Liberal candidate got only 14% of the votes in Malo’s riding during the previous federal election in 2015, and there is no indication that there will be a breakthrough this time. The 2019 campaign is also marked by the appearance of a powerful new player in Canada’s politics. Last year former Conservative politician Maxime Bernier formed the People’s Party of Canada (PPC), which has been gaining a lot of support across the nation. The party, which hasn't been well received by the government-sponsored mainstream media, has relied heavily on social networks in its campaign, facing fierce competition from both the liberals and the conservatives. “The conservatives didn’t expect us to grow to even where we’re now,” says People’s Party candidate Cody Payant. “They didn’t expect us to be in the debates. I think other parties are scared. They don’t know what to do, they weren’t prepared to debate us.” Payant is an accountant from Saskatoon – Saskatchewan’s fastest-growing urban community. The part of the city where he lives is known for voting liberal, but Payant is not afraid to engage in discussions with his political opponents and says that he often receives positive comments when people in the street see his PPC hat. This is the first federal campaign for Payant, but he says he’s a lot receiving a lot of positive feedback from Saskatchewan voters who are sending hundreds of emails and Facebook messages to him. In 2015 the Conservatives were followed closely in the Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek district by the New Democratic Party. Former NDP candidate Glenn Wright, who received 18% of votes in the previous election and came in second, is now running a public interest campaign independently, saying that he’s “calling out the structural problems with [Canada’s] democracy.” “Our government is captured by corporate interests - often the same corporate actors donate to both of the two major parties so that they can exercise strong influence no matter who wins,” Wright wrote in a statement received by Sputnik. “Enough is enough. My message in this campaign highlights the need to reform our politics, we must end first past the post, and we need proportional representation. Only through cooperation and compromise will we enact good policy that benefits all Canadians.” © Sputnik / Denis Bolotsky Federal elections in Canada Since 2015 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party has had a majority in the House of Commons to the 42nd Canadian parliament, which was dissolved in September this year. Key players, besides the Liberals and Conservatives, are the New Democratic Party, the Green Party and the Bloc Québécois. The 21 October vote will be overseen by Elections Canada – the country’s office of the Chief Electoral Officer, a non-government agency. There were calls to move the vote to another date because it fell on Shemini Atzeret – a part of the Jewish holiday Sukkot, but authorities refused to reschedule the election. Candidates representing the NDP and CPC in Saskatchewan’s Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek riding did not reply to Sputnik’s requests for comments at the time of publication.",

    "description": "The poll found that UK residents were losing trust in the popular social media platform over privacy and censorship concerns.",
    "articleText": "Brits were more likely to ditch Facebook than Huawei service products, an Open-Xchange poll published on Friday revealed. The UK consumer poll was conducted by Censuswide, which studied the attitudes towards big messaging platform providers such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and others, as well as consumer trust in big tech companies. Roughly a third (32 percent) said that they would stop using products and services from Facebook, with 14 percent stating they would also stop using WhatsApp and Instagram. But only 11 percent said that they would stop using Huawei products, despite US accusations that Huawei spies on its clients and customer base and poses a national security threat. 10 percent said that they would sever ties with Google and 11 with Apple. Around half of those polled said that they did not believe that big messaging platforms like Facebook and others respected their privacy, with over half stating that they did not trust them with personal data. Only five percent of those polled across the UK said that they 'completely' trusted big messaging platforms on how they handle data. Just six percent of responders said that big US tech firms 'completely' respected their privacy rights, indicating deep issues of trust on data sharing. A whopping 73 percent of British participants said that they had seen their trusts in big messaging platform providers erode over the last two years, with just 3 percent 'strongly disagreeing' with this statement, the survey found. 87 percent of UK consumers said that they would switch to a more trustworthy provider, according to the findings. Rafael Laguna, CEO of Open-Xchange, said: “Today's biggest privacy risks arguably come from the big messaging platform providers. These businesses are essentially utilities that we rely upon for personal and business communications; yet for a huge proportion of us, trust in these firms is at an all-time low. He added that such a \"significant chunk\" of the UK population distrusting chat applications indicated that a \"new approach to instant messaging\" was needed. The news comes after the US House Judiciary Committee set a 15 October deadline for Big Tech companies to provide documents for an inquiry on whether the firms had abused consumers via their market activities. The committee has received submissions from Apple, Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet, Facebook and others, according to lawmakers. The House lawmakers, who currently look into the Big Tech companies’ activities, have confirmed that they have received an initial batch of relevant documents from the firms. News also revealed that sales on Huawei revenues grew 24 percent year-on-year the first nine months of 2019, despite Washington's efforts to block market access to the Chinese tech giant's global business operations and access to key components from chipmakers Qualcomm, Intel, Broadcomm, and others. The Trump administration also placed Huawei, ZTE and over 70 Chinese firms on an entities list in May in hopes to limit Huawei's market shares and 5G ambitions, citing 'national security threats'.",

    "description": "The find, consisting of rare coins thought to have been stamped sometime between 1682 and 1712, was found at a site about two kilometers northeast of the Kremlin.",
    "articleText": "A miniature ceramic receptacle containing dozens of hand-minted kopek coins was found on Kostyanskiy Lane, Moscow, with the receptacle discovered about 150 centimeters below ground level, the mayor’s office has reported. The receptacle was said to have been decorated with ornaments and painted a light brown colour. Archeologists believe the item was used as an inkwell, and produced in Western Europe. The 98 white metal coins found in the jar weigh a total of 24.25 grammes, and are believed to have been minted between 1682 and 1712, during the rule of Tsar Peter the Great. © Photo : mos.ru Ancient coins The treasure was the second item found on Kostyanskiy Lane this year. In the summer, a trove of gold coins with a face value between 5 and ten rubles from the period of Tsar Nicholas the Second were found in a tin box. The territory where the artefacts were discovered was known to have situated one of the nearly two dozen settlements housing Moscow’s firearm infantry regiments, known as the Streltsy. These units enjoyed multiple privileges, including the right to drink alcohol and participate in trade. The Streltsy uprisings of 1682 and 1698 led Peter the Great to disband the units, with their housing then taken over by artisans and merchants. The uprisings helped lead to the creation of a regular Russian army. Although many of the buildings from the period have since been lost, a nearby church, the Church of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker, built between 1697 and 1712, continues to stand in the area. Peter the Great ruled Russia between 1682 and 1725, and is considered by many Russian historians to have been one of the greatest leaders in the country’s history. The tsar visited Western Europe as a young man, and worked to import the ideas of the Enlightenment into his home country upon his return. He carried out a wide range of economic, social, political, educational and military reforms, including the secularisation of education, the use of new technologies and the creation of industry. Peter the Great was also the founder of St. Petersburg, the city which became Russia’s capital during his reign.",

The US-led coalition withdrew from Kobani last week, on the eve of the Turkish operation in the area. On Wednesday, a coalition warplane bombed an arms depot at the Lafarge Cement Factory south of the town. Kobani has served as the centre of one of the administrative units of the ‘Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, a de facto autonomous region of Syria established in 2014. Syrian army forces originally left the territory in 2012 as the foreign-backed civil conflict in the country intensified. Between late 2014 and early 2015, Kobani was besieged by Daesh (ISIS)* terrorists, with the terrorists capturing many of the surrounding villages and engaging in ethnic cleansing and other crimes. With support from the US-led coalition, Kurdish fighters took back control over the region between 2015 and 2017. Last week, after the start of the Turkish operation in northern Syria, Kurdish authorities reached an agreement with Damascus allowing the Syrian government to deploy troops along the entire border with Turkey to try to halt the assault. Later, Russian peacekeeping forces were spotted in the city of Manbij, about 45 km southwest of Kobani, with their mission said to consist of separating Syrian and Kurdish forces in the area.

Amid warming relations between the Syrian government and the Kurds in the country’s north, observers began speculating about the fate of their de facto autonomous status. On Thursday, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior advisor to Syrian President Bashar Assad, said Damascus could not allow for the creation of a formal autonomy for the Kurds because of Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious makeup. Along with Syrian Arabs and Kurds, Syria is home to Turkmen, Druze, Ismailis, Palestinians, Circassians, Greeks, Ossetians, Assyrians, Armenians, Jews, Romanis and Yazidis. Sporadic clashes between Turkish and Kurdish Syrian forces continued on Friday, after the United States and Turkey reached an agreement on a 120-hour ceasefire in northeast Syria to allow YPG forces to withdraw. Turkey says its operation aims at establishing a security zone in northern Syria, and to prevent the operations of YPG fighters it says are allied the Turkish Kurdish PKK militia, whom Ankara classifies as terrorists. Damascus has slammed Turkey’s operations, accusing Ankara of “aggressive intentions” and saying it won’t tolerate the violation of Syria’s territorial integrity. * A terrorist group outlawed in Russia and many other countries.",

    "description": "On Thursday, Turkey agreed to suspend its Syria operation for 120 hours to facilitiate the withdrawal of Syrian Kurdish militia forces to a distance of about 30 km from the Turkish border. The agreement came after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came to Ankara for talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

Turkey halted its military operation in northern Syria for 120 hours on Thursday night following negotiations between Erdogan, Vice President Pence and Secretary Pompeo. Ankara began the campaign last Wednesday, saying its aim was to establish a security zone in northern Syria and to clear it of both Daesh and Syrian Kurdish militia known as the YPG (People's Protection Units). Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist group with ties to the PKK, a Turkish Kurdish political and militia force which has waged a low intensity guerilla war with the Turkish state for several decades. The United States, its NATO allies, and many other countries do not consider the YPG to be terrorists, and have called on Turkey to immediately halt its offensive in northern Syria. On Thursday, US lawmakers called the YPG forces America's greatest allies in the war against Daesh, and threatened to target Turkey with devastating sanctions on top of those already approved by the White House on Monday. *Aka Daesh, a terrorist group outlawed in Russia and many other countries.",

    "description": "Thursday October 17th was an historic day for the UK. I’m not talking about Boris’s EU deal either. I am talking about the day when, finally, the decent silent majority fought back against the cultural Marxists who are wrecking this country.",
    "articleText": "I loved the way that ordinary working-class commuters dragged a scruffy Global Extinction terrorist off the roof of a tube carriage at Canning Town and gave him a kick in. This was a clear sign that we have had enough of anti-democratic middle class acts of terrorism. I do not condone violence but why should ordinary hard working Londoners’ have to put up with this crap from middle class eco warriors any longer? The police have failed us, so the people have become the police. Our politicians have failed us, so we become the politicians. As for the Mayor, Sadiq Khan well he is just a failure, full stop! As the Clash sang many years ago, London is burning and so will be the rest of the country if our politicans do not start representing the majority whether it is over climate change demos, knife crime, immigration or Brexit. I see Global Extinction have accepted that having a demo on the tube was a ‘huge own goal’ and have cancelled a planned demo at Gatwick. Good. So, for once I agree with these scruffy Herberts that direct action does work! Why can’t Dick of the Yard and the Met see that pulling someone off the roof and giving them a bit of a slap seems to work more effectively than wearing rainbow shoelaces and dancing, raving or skateboarding on London bridges with these morons? People are getting angry and the events at Canning Town tube station should weigh heavily on MPs minds as they now consider Boris Johnson’s EU deal this weekend. I see ‘Wolfie Smith’ Comrade Corbyn has just revealed a new skill as a mind reader as he manged to slag off and say he would not support the Boris’ deal a full 28 minutes before it was actually printed! We should all ask Corbyn for the Lottery numbers for Saturday as the man is clearly a clairvoyant! Clearly, he is going to marshal his divided party to vote against the deal and push for a second referendum. A referendum? He is likely to get a revolution if he and the self-serving pigs of Westminster get their way. Media commentators are always eager to state that people are getting bored with Brexit and just want it over with. However, they are mistaking boredom for pent up frustration and anger from those of us who do not live in the Westminster bubble. People know that they have been betrayed and polls illustrate that respect for politicians is at an all-time low. Let me be clear, MPs will have more than 'hurty words' like traitor, betrayal and appeasers to worry about if they again ignore the wishes of the masses. Look, when it comes to Boris’s deal the devil is always in the detail and that will come out in the next few days but it looks okay to me. However, time is pressing and if the politicians are serious in saying that they want a deal then they are now drinking (probably subsidised by us the taxpaying mugs) in the last chance saloon. For myself personally, I want and have always wanted a full clean break Brexit. I have no fear of us heading to a 'cliff edge or leaving on a so-called no deal’ as that was always the alternative deal in my mind. However, if Boris has pulled off a workable compromise, the Muppets in the House of Commons should accept it and let’s get Brexit done so we can get on with a few other pressing problems, shall we? Like knife and gun crime, porous borders, a criminal justice system that favours the villain not the victim, overcrowded schools, lack of doctors and nurses etc; do I need to go on? Boris’ Queen’s speech this week was a tick box list of what most people want done in this country but of course, there was no chance of any of it happening as Boris has not got the numbers in parliament. So, the labour leaders were absolutely bang on the money to call it an election manifesto and let’s be straight - we do need an election pronto. This mess has to be sorted and although I normally agree with large parts of what Nigel Farage says I think that his call for a further Brexit delay and a general election is out of step with the mood of the people. Regardless, there will not be a delay anyway according to “Juncker the drunker” as he says the EU will refuse to agree to an extension if Boris is forced to deliver that dreadful letter. If he is telling the truth (and if he remembers when he wakes up!) Drunker has just killed off the Benn surrender act and the lickspittle Tory rebels in one slurred sentence. They have a clear choice now: either vote for Boris’ deal or vote no deal. Both of which suits me, to be frank. As for the Remainiacs, of all parties, they no longer have a leg to stand on. They said that they would force Boris to beg for an extension if there was no deal but now that there is clearly a deal and even Juncker is urging them to accept it, they must vote in favour of the new deal. Once the deal is approved, they will also no longer have an excuse to block a General Election which I presume Boris will call almost immediately and then he can enact his Queens speech and the UK can get down to forging a positive future and dealing with the issues that really do matter to people. So, it is clear the self-serving pigs have to either vote for this compromise deal or vote for no deal but they should not dare delay a decision any longer unless they too want to be pulled off the roof and given a kick in!

    "description": "Ominous black clouds over the Russian city of Krasnoyarsk hardly raise eyebrows among the locals, who are forced to contemplate them every winter when the temperatures drop.",
    "articleText": "A rational explanation for the chilling black clouds hanging over Krasnoyarsk has been offered up by an expert. Irina Smirnova, head of the laboratory for modeling and predicting atmospheric pollution of the Main Geophysical Observatory (GGO), sought to allay doomsday fears of internet users who witnessed the “black sky” phenomenon above the Russian city, as she explained this was due to a local use of coal by power plants instead of gas. Посмотреть эту публикацию в Instagram Красноярск - моя малая родина. Очень люблю этот город. Но с экологией тут полный швах. Да, это город-миллионник, здесь развита промышленность, много рабочих мест, неплохие зарплаты в сравнении со многими другими городами нашей страны, вообще это замечательный город, театры, кинотеатры, шикарные тц, замечательные люди, много досуговых мест для детей и взрослых. Но за всё это благополучие надо платить. И речь не о ценах на жильё или в магазинах... это победить можно так или иначе. Речь об экологии. \"Черное небо\" для Красноярска - стало таким привычным выражением, что уже никто не пугается. И это строшно... Я живу на Взлетке на высоком этаже.

И это не какое-то исключение, это происходит снова и снова. И только ветренный день в Красноярске теперь можно назвать \"хорошей погодой\", потому что смог продувается... Человек ко всему привыкает. Но когда я думаю про здоровье детей и про то, что никогда не смогу простить себе, если все эти превышения ПДК по нескольку раз за неделю однажды вылезут какой-нибудь непоправимой болячкой... не могу найти стоящих аргументов, что бы продолжать жить здесь.

When coal is burned, a large amount of aerosol impurities and sulfur compounds are formed, which under certain meteorological conditions do not disperse, but hang over the city,” said Smirnova. Experts have long been debating the problem of Krasnoyarsk, as black clouds over the Russian city occur quite frequently, particularly in winter, when temperatures drop. Experts cite a number of factors impacting the city's plight. Krasnoyarsk lies in a hollow, surrounded by mountains, has a “continental” climate, thus rendering dispersal of pollutants more difficult. Some scientists cite another complicating factor - the city is sprawled along the banks of the river Yenisei, which doesn’t freeze even in the most severe frosts, exuding steam. © REUTERS / Ilya Naymushin Красноярские моржи во время купания в Енисее",

    "description": "After successfully securing a withdrawal agreement from the European Union on Wednesday and ultimately solving the issue of the Irish backstop by keeping Northern Ireland in the Single Market but outside the Customs Union, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson must now win a majority vote and pass the deal through parliament.",
    "articleText": "Labour's shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he will be warning Labour MPs against voting for Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement on Saturday, claiming that no one with “the true interest of their constituents at heart” could back the deal, while speaking to BBC Radio 4′s Today programme on Friday morning. Fellow Labour MP Graham Stringer, who campaigned for a Leave vote in 2016, told LBC on Friday morning that he was “thinking hard” about backing the agreement. Labour MP Graham Stringer tells LBC he's \"thinking hard\" about whether to vote for Boris Johnson's deal, saying he wants to end the uncertainty of Brexit.@NickFerrariLBC | #BrexitDeal pic.twitter.com/pU11m6Z6go — LBC (@LBC) October 18, 2019 Jon Lansman the Chair of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, said on Twitter that Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) will have \"no choice\" but to replace Labour MPs who vote for the deal at the next election. Johnson's deal will be a wrecking ball through the lives & well-being of ordinary people across Britain. Labour MPs cannot and must not vote for it. If they do, the NEC will have no choice but to replace them with a new, socialist Labour candidate at the next election — Jon Lansman (@jonlansman) October 18, 2019 Fellow NEC member, Huda Elmi, also tweeted \"It's pretty basic. Being a Labour MP means opposing the Tories when they try to destroy our country\" and called the deal \"reckless.\" It’s pretty basic. Being a Labour MP means opposing the Tories when they try to destroy our country. This reckless sell out deal is even worse than Theresa May's, and any Labour MP that sides with Boris Johnson has no right to stand at the next election. — Huda Elmi (@hudaelmi_) October 18, 2019 So far the Labour Party has not said whether it will whip MPs into voting against the deal and despite rumours it currently appears that the whip will not be withdrawn from Labour MPs who vote with the government. This comes as Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that she has a \"real suspicion\" that Labour would be happy to see Boris Johnson's deal win the vote on Saturday, appearing to oppose it while giving the \"nod to ‘rebels’ to ensure numbers there to pass\". Hope I’m wrong but I have a real suspicion that Labour would be quite happy to see this deal go through. They will officially oppose but give nod to ‘rebels’ to ensure numbers there to pass. It will be the end of them in Scotland if they do end up facilitating Brexit. https://t.co/OVh7K7kQlO — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) October 18, 2019 Both comments come amid reports that a number of rebel Labour MPs in leave voting areas could potentially support Johnson's deal if the Prime Minister agrees to include commitments to rights and protections for workers in UK-law. An anonymous Labour backbencher from a Leave-voting constituency told the Huffington Post on Thursday said that they are looking through the text of the deal agreed to by the EU on Thursday, in particular the “level playing field” proposals to maintain the UK’s workers and environmental rights equivalent to the EU's. “In some ways, this is weaker than May’s deal because it takes them from the withdrawal agreement and puts them into the non-binding political declaration,” the MP said. “But if Boris can write all these things onto the face of a bill, and bring that bill forward pronto, we can vote for it,” he said. Concerns from Labour MPs in leave seats were raised regarding the party's position, saying that the leadership were forcing them to support the deal as their constituents would not accept a second referendum. The Labour leadership has strongly opposed the deal with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer slamming it as \"even worse\" than Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. If anyone has any doubts about where Boris Johnson’s proposals take us, this lays bare that the end destination is a damaging right-wing project, which will rip apart our relationship with the EU and replace it with a US-style economy. https://t.co/F3A5M9FWGi — Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) October 18, 2019 Corbyn has made it clear that he rejects the PMs deal and opposes divergence from EU rules and regulations on social rights, which he believes set the stage for a \"Trump deal\". “This sell out deal won’t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote,” Corbyn said on Thursday. Despite previously saying he wanted to a General Election before any second referendum on Brexit, the Labour leadership may move to force a referendum on the Prime Ministers deal. The chances of Johnson's deal succeeding remain increasingly thin as his confidence and supply partners the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have confirmed that they will not be supporting the deal, seeing single market membership for Northern Ireland and the deals de facto customs border down the Irish Sea as unsatisfactory. The Liberal Democrats have likewise pledged a three-line whip to keep MPs in line and vote against the government This is our chance to #GetBrexitDone 🇬🇧 pic.twitter.com/4OC6TwZuXO — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 18, 2019 To win the vote, the government will need at least 318 vote. If every Conservative MP supports the deal, the government will have just 285 votes, which would require opposition rebels to switch sides. Boris Johnson has consistently pledged that he will bring the UK out of the European Union by the 31 October deadline. However, if the vote fails, he is required under the Benn act to request a Brexit extension. Earlier this month, around 19 Labour MPs wrote to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, declaring that they “wish to see the British EU referendum result honoured without further delay.”",

He says that, “The idea that you have to beg an anarchist to get through an illegal roadblock to see a dying friend absolutely appals me and someone needs to bring order back or it will all end very badly.” Mike believes that the BBC is not impartial on climate change and their treatment of Boris has been appalling. Warming up he states, “Woman’s hour is obsessed with racial issues, gender and always seems to have left wing activists on it but they do not have right wing ones on. It does not represent mainstream Britain.” He believes that there is manipulation in TV drama advertising and films to hit diversity targets which he says is “Orwellian in nature.” Mike believes it is not about the BBC and other broadcasters being left-wing but it is all about so-called 'political correctness' and 'a cultural Marxist agenda'. Mike believes this is now also happening in the new media and says, “All around us free speech is being closed down.” Mike claims that Twitter is acting like a censor and he says his account has been banned and he has had followers culled and posts deleted.” He talks about just how powerful Facebook and Twitter are with all the data and information we have given them.

    "description": "Last month, the newspaper Izvestia cited a Russian Navy General Staff source as saying that the new Borei-class attack submarine Knyaz Oleg (Prince Oleg), equipped with 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles, is due to join the country’s Pacific Fleet in 2020.",
    "articleText": "In an opinion piece for the US magazine National Interest, American military expert Sebastien Roblin specifically focused on Russia’s 4th generation nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), describing the Borei-class vessels as Moscow’s “real doomsday device”. The author recalled that similar submarines are possessed by the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, and India. He claimed that “the primary purpose of Borei-class submarines is almost unimaginably grim: to bring ruin to an adversary’s cities, even should other nuclear forces be wiped out in a first strike.” Borei Sub’s Sophisticated ICBMs The expert referred to the Borei as “the most advanced SSBN in the Russian Navy”, armed with 16 Bulava (Mace)R-30 intercontinental ballistic missiles each carrying six individually targeted 150-kiloton warheads, designed to split apart and hit separate targets. “The Bulava has an unusually shallow flight trajectory, making it harder to intercept, and can be fired while the Borei is moving. The 40-ton missiles can deploy up to 40 decoys to try to divert defensive missiles fire by anti-ballistic missiles systems like the Alaska-based Ground-based Midcourse Defence system,” Poplin noted. Massive firing from the submarine \"Yury Dolgoruky\" with four Bulava missiles at the Kura test site in Kamchatka is recorded in the book of records of the Russian Armed Forces pic.twitter.com/7RMyVgpSU1 — PETE JOHN ︻╦╤─ 10 (@SEEKINGTHETRU17) March 19, 2019 He also specifically focused on the submarine’s sleek 170-meter-long hull coated in sound-dampening rubber, something that helps meet the Borei’s “primary purpose to remain undetected long enough to unleash its terrifying firepower”. “Towards that end, the Borei is designed to higher standards of acoustic stealth than Soviet-era designs, and is more capable of evading enemies that do get an inkling of its position,” the author points out. Separately, he touched upon the sub’s jet propulsion system that makes it possible for the Borei “to remain unusually quiet while cruising near its maximum underwater speed of thirty knots”. Yury Dolgoruky K-535 4th Generation Strategic Nuclear Submarine. #Russia pic.twitter.com/oF0xsGJZdb — Enrico Ivanov ☦ (@Russ_Warrior) October 15, 2014 “This probably makes the Borei quieter, and able to remain discrete at higher speeds, than the propeller-driven Ohio-class submarine”, Roblin underscored. He singled out three Borei-class submarines that are currently afloat, with the Yuri Dolgoruky serving with the Northern Fleet, while the Alexander Nevsky and the Vladimir Monomakh are with the Pacific Fleet’s Vilyuchinsk base on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russia Develops State-of-the-Art Borei-A Submarines Additionally, Roblin referred to Russia’s efforts to develop Project 955A Borei-II/Borei-A submarines which will have more advanced characteristics as compared to the previous version. For example, the lead such sub, the Knyaz Vladimir (Prince Vladimir) is due to be commissioned before the end of this year and will be equipped with modernised combat, sensor and communications systems, as well as improved acoustic stealth and crew habitability, according to the expert. In this context, he quoted an unnamed Russian source as saying that the new sub is upgraded in order to “decrease launch time to the minimum”. He concluded by claiming that the development of the SSBNs and the Khabarovsk-class subs, which are now “another half of the Russian Navy’s future sea-based nuclear deterrence force” along with the Borei vessels, indicate that “Moscow, it seems, would like a little more redundancy in its ability” to tackle a possible nuclear conflict. The Russian newspaper Izvestia has , meanwhile, quoted a Russian Navy General Staff source as saying that the new Borei-class attack submarine Knyaz Oleg (Prince Oleg), will join the Russian Pacific Fleet in 2020. The vessel will be stationed in Kamchatka, the source said, adding that its crew has already been trained and is waiting for its launch in the city of Severodvinsk.",

The pro-energy rally is being organised by the local group United We Roll, for Canada which staged a similar rally in February to challenge a pair of environmental bills that are both praised and criticised for toughening the already difficult regulatory environment for Canadian energy companies. “We in the province of Alberta are tired of celebrities coming into our province and trying to tell us how to run our oil and gas sector,” the organisers said in a Facebook post on Wednesday, asking everyone concerned to “come out in unity to show Greta we do not need her yelling at us.” Convoy co-organiser Joel Mullan told Global News that they certainly won’t be intimidating the 16-year-old activist. “We also want to make the message very, very clear that this is the most ethically produced and cleanest-produced oil in the world. Our environmental standards are second to none,” he said. Thunberg, currently on a tour of North America, came to international prominence after staging solo climate protests outside the Swedish parliament last year. She has since launched the Fridays for Change campaign — international school strikes protesting against perceived government and business inaction on climate change — and established herself as the most recognisable face of the environmental movement after addressing the UN climate action summit in late September.",

    "description": "Europol researchers are highlighting the importance of investigating female criminal behaviour “to determine whether the policy prescriptions to reduce crime should differ for women.”",
    "articleText": "The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, commonly known as Europol, has confirmed that women are quite capable of committing serious crimes like arms and drugs trafficking, murder or grievous bodily injury, by launching a new online campaign. As part of this new initiative, Europol revealed the identities of the 21 most wanted fugitives sought by each of the European Union’s member-state, with 18 of the fugitives being women. Are women equally as capable of committing serious crimes as men? The female fugitives featured on https://t.co/SWHRuXpsNQ prove that they are. Discover their crimes and help us catch #EUMostWanted fugitives: pic.twitter.com/fbpdZw72gp — Europol (@Europol) 18 октября 2019 г. The face of each fugitive, as presented on the euromostwanted.eu website, is initially concealed by a mask which is gradually being removed as one read’s through that person’s record, thus making it practically impossible to guess the suspect’s gender from the start. The shady and dangerous ladies listed on the website include Zorka Rogic, sought in Croatia for arms trafficking and drug trafficking; Jessica Edosomwan, who is wanted in France for being a member of a criminal network that recruited young girls in Nigeria and forced them into prostitution in Europe, using juju rites to cow them into submission; and Adilet Shakirgazieva, the only female member of a criminal group of five that broke into numerous apartments on Malta in order to steal valuables. As the agency noted in a press release, the number of \"the number of women engaged in criminal activity has increased, although at a slower pace than men\", with researchers highlighting the importance of investigating female criminal behaviour \"to determine whether the policy prescriptions to reduce crime should differ for women\". The release also notes that the goal of this new campaign is to attract as much public attention as possible in order to increase the odds of obtaining information that could help the authorities to apprehend some of these fugitives. \"This approach has proven successful in the past three years. After every large communication campaign, several wanted fugitives were arrested or turned themselves in because the pressure became too high for them and/or their relatives\", the release said. \"Since the launch of the project, 69 criminals who featured on the website have been arrested. In at least 21 cases this was down to information received from the general public via the website\".",

    "title": "Brexit or Bust? It's ‘Super Saturday’ at Westminster and Ascot!",
    "description": "Saturday is a ‘make or break’ day for Brexit as the first Saturday session of the House of Commons since 1982 votes on PM Boris Johnson’s new deal- but there’s quite a lot at stake too at Ascot racecourse, where some of the best horses in the world compete in ‘Champions Day’.",
    "articleText": "It’s not going to be your average run-of-the-mill Saturday, that’s for sure. The last time the UK Parliament sat on the first day of the weekend was on 3rd April 1982, to discuss General Galtieri’s invasion of the Falkland Islands. Before that is was in November 1956, at the time of the Suez crisis. Now in 2019, it’s the Brexit Civil War that could be settled. By the close of play this Saturday evening Boris Johnson could be hailed as the man who finally achieved Britain’s exit from the European Union. Against all the predictions of the Doubting Thomases (or rather that Doubting Phils, Ambers, Jos and Keirs), BoJo has managed to get a new, improved deal from Brussels. The new agreement ditches controversial Northern Ireland ‘Back-Stop’. It’s a deal that, while being far from perfect (which deals are?), the UK government and the EU seem happy with. But will he get it through Parliament? It’s likely to be incredibly close as Remainers, who don’t want Britain to leave the EU under any circumstances, dig in. One prediction I’ve seen even has it as a tie, with the deciding vote going to the pro-Remain Speaker, John Bercow. The bookies currently go 10-11 about the deal passing and 10-11 about it failing. © AFP 2019 / KENZO TRIBOUILLARD British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves a European Union Summit at European Union Headquarters in Brussels on October 18, 2019. To win the vote, Johnson needs to get at least some DUP MPs on board, and a reasonable number of pro-Leave Labour MPs too. But the pressure on these Labour MPs to toe the party line and vote against the deal will be immense. Already Momentum’s Jon Lansman has tweeted ‘Labour MPs cannot and must not vote for it’, warning that the NEC would ‘have no choice’ but to replace these MPs before the next election. This negative approach is I believe a major miscalculation by Labour. Opinion polls show us that people just want Brexit over and done with now. If Labour succeeds in blocking Johnson’s deal- or attaching it to a new referendum, it’s highly unlikely the Brexit-fatigued public will be grateful. Instead, a beating for the ‘Brexit-blockers’ at the ballot-box awaits. I’ve already mentioned in previous pieces the detailed academic research which shows that Labour’s path to power lies through Leave-voting Tory-held marginals in the north and the midlands. A lot of Labour MPs and supporters seem to be in complete denial over this and still think, contrary to all the evidence that ‘Remain’ is the way to victory! The great irony is that the ‘treacherous’ Labour MPs who do vote for the deal and help get Brexit over the line, three-and-a-half years after the original referendum, could be doing Jeremy Corbyn a big favour. Only don’t expect the one-time fierce Euro-sceptic to thank them publicly for it. At the same time as the drama will be unfolding at Westminster, about 30 miles from central London, there’ll be a drama of a different kind at Ascot racecourse. It’s Qipco Champions Day. Last year in this column, I predicted a ‘bold challenge’ from the 250-1 Czech raider Subway Dancer, who repaid each-way support by finishing third in the Champions Stakes. What are the best bets this year? 1.35 Champions Sprint Stakes (Group 1) Advertise won on good-to-soft at Royal Ascot in June and although the going is now heavy, he has to be respected along with last year’s winner Sands of Mali. The one I like the best is Irish challenger Make a Challenge who won very easily on soft-to-heavy at the Curragh last time and looks well-drawn. At very juicy odds, Keystroke looks overpriced at 66-1, considering he was third under a penalty in course-and-distance Group Three last time but is now 3lbs better off for a 2l beating with winner Cape Byron who is just 10-1. 2.10. Champions Long Distance Cup (Group 1) Top stayer Stradivarius is going for his eleventh straight win under Frankie Dettori, and although his last defeat- in October 2017- came on soft ground in this, he still looks hard to oppose on the form book. Capri, sixth in the Ascot Gold Cup, could be the each-way value at 40-1. 2.45 Champions Fillies and Mares (Group 1) Star Catcher, a winner on soft-ground at the Royal meeting looks a worthy favourite; Tarnawa and Antonia De Vega from the in-form Ralph Beckett yard, are of definite each-way interest. © Sputnik / Neil Clark Stradivarius, favourite for the Long Distance Cup, after his victory at York 3.20 QEII Stakes (Group 1) French raider The Revenant was impressive at Longchamp and has got his ground. He could prove hard to beat. Lord Glitters has only finished out of the placings once in six runs at Ascot and won on this card in 2017, so has definite each-way possibilities. Safe Voyage has good form on the testing ground (albeit over a furlong shorter) and might be worth an each-way interest at 25-1. 4.00 Champion Stakes Addeybb is just holding on for favouritism at time of writing and while he has a very obvious chance given his soft/heavy ground form, Coronet, at 7-2 is marginally preferred. The mare, only beaten a length in the fillies and mares on this card twelve months ago, when trying to concede 6lbs to Magical (who she faces on level terms today), also won on heavy last time out and trainer John Gosden has landed this the past two seasons. I Can Fly was second in the QEII behind the brilliant Roaring Lion on this card last year at 33-1 and could place again at 20-1. 4.40 Balmoral Handicap Lord North may have 'lost the colonies', but his equine namesake won the Cambridgeshire so easily you can see why he’s the favourite for this 1mile finale. The best value bet in the race could be Escobar (12-1), who was just pipped in this last year at odds of 33-1 and was a staying-on third on testing ground over 7f at Ascot on his last run. That should have him nicely teed up for this. Follow Neil Clark @NeilClark66 and @MightyMagyar The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "title": "'Historic Error': Talks on North Macedonia and Albania EU Accession Collapse",
    "description": "After EU ministers failed to reach a deal on the question of enlargement at a meeting of the General Affairs Council earlier this week, Tusk moved the matter to the leaders' summit agenda - although Macron made clear he would obstruct any progress, on 16th October demanding wholesale upheaval of the accession system in its entirety.",
    "articleText": "After intense and protracted debate, European Union leaders have failed to reach any agreement on the future bloc accession of North Macedonia and Albania, not even able to craft an official statement encouraging either country to pursue membership. EU Council President Donald Tusk said the bloc's leaders made a \"mistake\" in failing to approve membership talks for the two countries, while EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was a \"historic error\". French President Emmanuel Macron was a fervent opponent of membership talks, in the face of voluble support from European Council President Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Conversely, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte supported a ‘third way’ compromise that would allow talks to begin with North Macedonian leaders while compelling Albania to wait longer. \"I think we have to reform this procedure, which is irreversible, not progressive and has not adapted. We do things that are bizarre…We give visa liberalization, the right to move freely between our countries, before we even open the negotiations,” Macron fulminated. Deeply disappointed that EU Ministers at #GAC unable to agree on opening negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania. They fulfilled the conditions, EU should not hesitate. Accession process is best tool we have to influence developments in WB. Why are we tying our own hands? — Miroslav Lajčák (@MiroslavLajcak) October 15, 2019 As a result of this “bizarre” relationship, Macron said he struggled to tell the French \"everything’s going so well we’re going to open negotiations” with Albania, when \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of Albanians ask for asylum in his country. He nonetheless insisted he wished to send a positive signal to leaders of North Macedonia and Albania, and agreed with Merkel the Balkans were of great strategic importance to Brussels - but nonetheless said the EU needed more time to get its own house in order before considering further expansion. “Europe is a big and beautiful house, which we live in together. A few years ago, a member of the family decided to leave and it's a lot of trouble for them to leave the house. And we sometimes have trouble renovating the house, to repair the lights, the electricity. And by the way, a lot of members, when you ask them, 'are you ready to invest to repair the lights, to redo the door?' they say, 'no, I'm not'. But the same people sometimes say, even though we don't know how people can leave, or how to renovate, we want to invite in new friends,” he lamented. The 2003 European Council summit in Thessaloniki set integration of the Western Balkans as a priority for EU expansion - Slovenia, the first former Yugoslavian constituent country to obtain independence, joined the bloc in 2004, followed by Croatia in 2013. Albania, Serbia, North Macedonia, and Montenegro are all candidate states, with Montenegro and Serbia in negotiations. Bosnia and Herzegovina has applied but is not yet recognised as a candidate while Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, is not recognised by all EU states. It was originally projected that talks with North Macedonia and Albania would start by the end of 2019, with a tentative joining date of 2025.",

    "description": "Gorbachev was the last General Secretary and President of the Soviet Union, leading the country until its collapse in 1991.",
    "articleText": "Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev says he has sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but declined to reveal its contents. “World leaders today have a huge responsibility. This is an alarming time, frankly speaking. And [leadership] is a tremendous weight, including on the human and psychological level. I know this from my own experience,” Gorbachev said, speaking to Russia’s Izvestia newspaper. “I would not like to be called an advisor. Only in some special cases do I appeal to leaders – as a rule through a short letter. Some time ago I appealed to Vladimir Putin and French President [Emmanuel] Macron,” the 88-year-old former politician said. Gorbachev emphasised that he was “not hiding anywhere” or keeping his opinion to himself. “I react events, and speak out in interviews and articles which are published in our country and abroad. Sometimes I notice that my thoughts resonate with the words and actions of leaders,” he noted. Gorbachev, who signed the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with US President Ronald Reagan, warned the Trump administration’s recent move to scrap the treaty posed a threat to global strategic stability. “Talks are needed to ensure that the treaty’s destruction does not heighten the risk of war. President Vladimir Putin proposed a moratorium on the deployment of such missiles. This could be the first step. But I will repeat – talks are necessary, first and foremost between Russia and the United States,” Gorbachev emphasised. © AP Photo / Bob Daugherty Dec. 8, 1987, file photo, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, right, shakes hands with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev after the two leaders signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in March 1985. The former leader has been widely praised for his efforts to end the Cold War, but also been heavily criticised in his home country for the failure of his economic and political reforms, which led to the dismantling of the Warsaw Pact security alliance, the end of the USSR’s superpower status and the collapse of the Soviet Union itself in December 1991. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed in the waning days of the Cold War in December 1987, and prohibited the development, manufacture and deployment of ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles in the 500-5,500 km range. From the late 1980s to the late 2010s, the treaty was seen as a cornerstone of European security against nuclear war. In early 2019, the Trump administration announced that it would be suspending its compliance with the treaty effective August 2, 2019. After the US withdrawal, Russia, the treaty’s other signatory, announced that it too would be scrapping the treaty. Last month, Moscow announced that although that it would begin research into missiles previously outlawed by the treaty, it would not deploy them unless Washington did so first.",

    "description": "One of the series’ characters quoted word-for-word LeBron James’ comments that there may be “ramifications” for exercising one's freedom of speech.",
    "articleText": "South Park took what seemed to be a clear dig at LeBron James over the NBA star’s response to the dispute revolving around the league, China, and Hong Kong. Wednesday’s episode of the satirical animated series, titled Let Them Eat Goo, which goes hard on the nation’s current obsession with plant-based meat diets, features a diatribe by fourth-grader Eric Cartman, who reproaches a classmate for saying that those advocating for healthier food have “a right to free speech”. \"Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you are not thinking about others and only thinking about yourself!” Cartman yelled. #SouthPark23 pic.twitter.com/lqZbv6uJsW — South Park (@SouthPark) October 17, 2019 Seconds later, the meat-loving Eric said that students trying to change his lunch “don't realise it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually”. This rant, perhaps not coincidentally put into the mouth of the series’ most disagreeable main character, was a direct quote of LeBron, who said it to reporters word-for-word on Monday as he waded in the ongoing row. The China-NBA feud It all started early this month after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a message of support to the Hong Kong protesters, reading “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong”. The Rockets are extremely popular in China, largely due to its now-retired player Yao Ming, so Morey’s post, seen in Beijing as interference in its internal affairs, irked numerous Chinese NBA fans. The Chinese Basketball Association, where Ming is president, ended cooperation with the Rockets, while local state television suspended two NBA pre-season game broadcasts. Morey was forced to delete the tweet and said in a follow-up statement that he didn’t mean to offend anyone and was “merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event”. The Rockets said his problematic Hong Kong post did not represent the club’s opinion and did not discipline the executive. LeBron's reaction LeBron James inititally appeared to take China’s side in the dispute, saying Morey “wasn’t educated about the situation at hand”. He later clarified he meant Morey wasn’t educated on the repercussions of dropping political statements rather than on the situation in Hong Kong. “Let me clear up the confusion,” he wrote. “I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I’m not discussing the substance.” Let me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I’m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. — LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019 Five months of Hong Kong protests Mass protests have gripped Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region under Chinese rule, since June. The movement initially started off as peaceful demonstrations against a proposed bill that would allow for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. The bill has since been scrapped, but the protests have persisted, leading to guerrilla-style battles with Hong Kong police, with protesters demanding that China not appoint members of the city legislature and amnesty for those charged with rioting. Beijing has repeatedly accused foreign nations, the US in particular, of interfering in the Hong Kong protests. One of the previous episodes of South Park showed another character, Randy Marsh, subjected to forced labour and re-education in China after being caught selling marijuana there. Chinese regulators in response scrubbed all episodes and clips of the show from local streaming services and social media, prompting a tongue-in-cheek apology from the series’ creators. “Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,” they said. “We too love money more than freedom and democracy.”",

    "description": "On Friday morning, Lebanese security forces used tear gas and rubber batons in downtown Beirut to disperse protesters demonstrating against the tax policy of the coalition government of Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Activists blocked the southern exit of Beirut and the highway to Damascus.",
    "articleText": "The Lebanese Cabinet previously approved a tax on the use of messaging apps, such as WhatsApp ($6 per month), as well as a tax on tobacco products (about $1.30 per import pack, $0.50 per local pack). It also plans to increase VAT to 15% by 2022. Protesters: Life is Unbearable “The situation is just unbearable,” one of the protesters told Sputnik. “We live in a state of constant crisis, on the brink of survival. And now the state imposes new taxes that hit the poor common people. We protest not only for our own sake but also for the sake of our children. We’ll continue demonstrating to stop the corruption and theft that Lebanese politicians are engaged in.” “We are protesting against corruption and quotas in the political system. We want to overthrow the government and the President, and dissolve parliament. We want to hold accountable every politician who’s stealing. By their actions, they’ve brought the people to hunger.

    "description": "Officers arrested 743 people and seized drugs worth almost £500,000 12 guns and dozens of other weapons. The combined operation involved forces across England and Wales, and resulted in the disruption of 49 deal lines, officers say.",
    "articleText": "UK police have made a record number of arrests in a week-long crackdown on so-called county lines drug gangs. County lines criminal syndicates use dedicated phone lines to send mass texts to customers and organise networks of couriers - often children - to move drugs from cities to smaller towns. The dealers themselves, typically based in distant cities, remain anonymous and disconnected from the groundwork to avoid getting caught. In the process, vulnerable individuals are exposed to physical, mental and sexual abuse, and in some instances will be trafficked to areas a long way from home as part of the network’s drug dealing business. Overall, 652 men and 91 women were arrested in the ‘National Week of Intensification’ - the targeted activity, coordinated by the National County Lines Coordination Centre (NCLCC), jointly run by the NCA and NPCC, was led by police forces and Regional Organised Crime Units. This is the fourth ‘week of intensification’ since the NCLCC was launched in 2018. On top of raids at dawn and stopping vehicles ferrying drugs and county lines operatives, the operation also made use of intelligence from the National Crime Agency and automatic number plate recognition cameras. During the devastating news of unceasing rise in knife crime over the last few years, it’s encouraging to hear the Chief Constable of @kent_police talk about the causes of it & how young ppl groomed for #CountyLines should be seen as safeguarding & not just criminals cases. #ACEs pic.twitter.com/vdq5wZ2SAE — Leroy Logan MBE (@LeroyLogan999) October 18, 2019 Authorities state they will now treat County Lines networks as child traffickers, not just drug dealers, under modern slavery legislation. It's uncertain how many children are embroiled in such activities, but the UK Children's Commissioner estimates there at least 46,000 in England — with 4,000 in London alone — operating in around 1,000 gangs. National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for County Lines, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Duncan Ball, said: “During the past week we have made further strides in tackling and dismantling the activities of County Lines gangs. The large number of arrests and weapons seized is testament to the joined-up work between law enforcement and our partners. We will not treat the criminals who run these lines just as drug dealers. We will work tirelessly to prosecute them for these offences but also, where we have the evidence, we will seek to prosecute them for child trafficking under modern slavery laws to reflect the devastating nature of their exploitation of young and vulnerable people. We need the public to continue helping us with information or concerns they have. This can be done anonymously through Crimestoppers.” We've safeguarded more than 100 people in a #countylines week of action across #Merseyside.

Neil Woods, formerly the UK’s top undercover police officer and now an advocate of drug legalisation, previously told Sputnik if people like him hadn’t have been so successful, “children wouldn't be used by gangs now”. “Getting them to hold and/or sell drugs is a great defense – it's borderline impossible to embed an undercover in a teenage racket. Also, they're highly disposable, easily manipulated, and readily bought. This is the tip of the iceberg, too, we ain't seen nothing yet. It's going to get significantly worse — more competitive, more violent, it's going to spill onto city streets everywhere,\" Neil contends.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Farmers in India have launched a countrywide protest against the world’s most significant trade agreement - the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – which India is set to finalise with the Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) bloc and five other countries - China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "articleText": "Indian farmers fear that lowering the import tariffs on various farm commodities will hurt their prospects in the market. The RCEP is a trade pact in which the signatories agree to reduce or abolish tariffs on imports and exports. The pact is imperative to India as nearly 20 per cent of its exports go to members of RCEP, and 35 per cent of its imports are also from this bloc. Krishnabeer Chaudhary, President of India's prominent farmers' trade union and former member of the agriculture policy-making committee, told Sputnik that the welfare of farmers should be the government's priority. \"The Indian government has promised to double farmers' incomes but allowing imports at low tariffs will put pressure on our ill-equipped farmers, who will be left to compete with countries that receive heavy production subsidies from their respective governments,\" he said. On being asked whether opting out of the pact may incur an economic loss for the country, he said India is currently going through a slowdown, and the economy can only be revived if the government focuses on improving the abysmal state of Indian agriculture. The Indian government has also, through a provision, included the dairy segment in the agreement –opening up a huge market for Indian milk producers with zero to low tariffs. Claiming that development in the sector is gradually taking place, Chaudhary said the government should provide production-based subsidies to farmers, especially in the dairy sector, because rearing animals includes a plethora of cost-intensive practices and there was no margin left for dairy farmers. Not just the farm sector, but small scale manufacturing companies are also dreading the impact of the agreement. China is at the forefront of pushing the RCEP as the country, after further relaxation of tariffs, would be able to penetrate deeper into the Indian market. The Dragon is gradually expanding its footprints in the Southeast Asia region, which makes it even more critical for India to stay in the deal. Rahul Singh, an expert in economy and trade, on the other hand, told Sputnik that bilateral and multilateral trade pacts are a product of globalization. \"The collaboration (RCEP) will offer Indian farmers an economy of scale, and the demand volume will increase and will directly benefit farmers. Such polarization was expected as the multipolar group of nations are writing on the wall as globalization is not working well at present,\" he added. RCEP aims to create a free trade zone that includes half of the world's population and 34 per cent of its global gross domestic product.",

    "description": "The Baltic Sea is rich not only in underwater amber deposits, its blue depths hide other treasures. Kaliningrad wreck divers know this like no one else.",
    "articleText": "Red Ship König team member and wreck diver Timur Akhmedzyanov, in an interview with Sputnik, explained that a large number of wrecks have remained at the bottom of the Baltic Sea since the First and Second World War. “Most of the discoveries were made in the areas of Cape Taran and Baltiyskaya Kosa (Baltiysk Spit). Mostly, these are the ships that were destroyed during the assault on Königsberg and Pillau (the town's name was changed to Baltiysk in 1946 – ed. note Sputnik). Among the most visited by wreck diving enthusiasts are four warships, two of which are German. However, perhaps the most famous local wreck is the Drache, a German warship. It’s practically undamaged, it still has anchors, guns preserved, for example, gun aiming mechanisms still function, you can spin them”, Timur Akhmedzyanov said. Submarines, Icebreakers and Military Targets According to him, many other objects rest on the Baltic's bottom, and not all have been studied yet: “For example, there lies a submarine, to which we managed to dive only once. The object is located at a technical depth of 65 metres – it requires wreck diving special equipment and training. Not far from the shore, an icebreaker stands on an even keel, that is, it lies horizontally at the seabed, a large beautiful ship, but, unfortunately, it is quickly falling apart”, he told Sputnik. Wreck divers also stumble upon target ships deliberately sunk during naval exercises - these were dismantled ships used by the military for firing practice. “In the area of Cape Taran, you can see a beautiful vessel, which was most likely a fishing boat. It stands on an even keel with all the windlasses and anchors removed from it. You can see the ship was deliberately prepared for flooding”, Timur Akhmedzyanov said. To find a shipwreck is quite difficult and in itself is considered sheer luck. If last year Kaliningrad wreck divers failed to find any such object, then this year they were lucky to discover four at once. “Among the three new shipwrecks that we found this summer was a relatively modern barge, and, more surprisingly, a completely wooden vessel, presumably built before 1900. It has no metal parts at all. Nothing is written on its broadsides. If we can identify it, that would be a great success,” the Red Ship König team assured. © Photo : Timur Achmedzianow Diving wreck of Velox Not Only to Discover but Find Information on the Ship Wreck divers try to be interested in the history of the objects they find. As Sputnik’s interlocutor noted, if you have information about a sunken ship, you can better navigate underwater having a picture of what was where. “For example, when a few years ago we discovered a keel-laying plate from one of the found heavily damaged wooden ships, we contacted the German archives. We managed to find out by the shipyard’s name and number that it was the merchant ship Velox, built in 1883, which was destroyed by a mine in 1913. Furthermore, we could even find its picture. But this is still a unique case!” Timur Akhmedzyanov said. He also emphasised that it’s not so easy discovering various kinds of “identification marks” on a ship to identify it: “The sea is ever-changing: it sometimes covers the object up with sand, then opens it up when you least expect it. The waves carry the ship’s remnants: they are light, and get mixed all the time. On top of that, visibility in the Baltic Sea does not always allow for a good view of the submerged object”. Fishermen Help Wreck Divers, the Military Don't According to Timur Akhmedzyanov, the above-mentioned findings in the Kaliningrad region are far from everything the Baltic Sea has to offer. However, in order to regularly discover new wrecks, “informants” are needed, not just special resources and equipment,. “In Poland, probably, 100 times more wrecks were discovered. After all, Pillau was a military city, sea routes passed through there, which means there should be a lot of objects nearby, and not all of them have been discovered at the moment. The military does not provide such information. Only fishermen, if they manage to notice something, share information with us”, the wreck diver explained. In turn, Kaliningrad wreck divers transfer data on discoveries in the Baltic to the Museum of the World Ocean. Often, thanks to this cooperation, it makes it possible to add to the museum’s collection: “From one of the discovered vessels, our team picked up a wooden frame and handed it to the museum, where it was mothballed to prevent destruction. Otherwise, everything rots away and turns into dust. The museum will examine all of it and can find out the age of the vessel. And then the object will become one of the exhibits”, Akhmedzyanov told Sputnik. © Photo : Timur Achmedzianow Timur Achmedzianow No Treasures and Skeletons so Far Although the first thing that comes to mind for those asking about diving to the sunken ships in the Baltic is probably treasure, however, wreck divers themselves have yet to find. “There were no gold chests yet. Do not forget, everything is different at the depth: under the influence of water, storms, everything breaks down, it is extremely difficult to find preserved valuable artefacts,” Timur Akhmedzyanov explained. He added that local wreck divers also did not come across skeletons or separate bones: “We have seen laced shoes. Most likely, if the body was there, then it was either eaten by fish, or something else happened. In any case, we try not to touch such things. Firstly, it’s unpleasant, and secondly – why bother?” According to him, boat owners who have lost motors or anchors often turn to wreck divers for help to search for them at the depth. © Photo : Timur Achmedzianow Timur Achmedzianow Do Not Dive Without Body, Do Not go Inside the Ship Timur Akhmedzyanov does not deny that wreck diving is directly related to risks. First of all, the water in the Baltic is quite cold, on average 15° (in the cold season the temperature drops to 2°), and secondly, the sea is unpredictable. During the dive and at the seabed everything can look calm but at the top, there could be a storm rising. Thirdly, old structures can collapse underwater at any time. According to him, storms greatly change the appearance of an object: decks break down; huge sheets of structures are thrown like pillows: “You need to be very careful and follow certain rules. You cannot go inside the ship: you may get in and not get out of there. You should have a minimum of hanging objects – sometimes people dive with flashlights, cameras. Instead, everything should be picked up and folded so that you never catch on anything. Apart from that, a body is mandatory”. According to Sputnik's interlocutor, to get better (for example, to cure decompression, or decompression sickness that occurs in case of unsuccessful dives), wreck divers can use pressure chambers – the Kaliningrad military has them. “Fortunately, we have not yet requested their help and try not to go to technical depths. Firstly, it is dangerous, secondly, as I said, it is necessary to have special technical equipment, and thirdly, we have a lot to see at recreational depths – up to 40 meters. By the way, that’s why our deep wrecks are not fully studied: they rest at depths of 60, 70, 80 meters. You need to prepare very well to dive there”, Timur Akhmedzyanov said. Anna Sanina",

    "description": "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders agreed on a new Brexit deal to take the UK out of the bloc on 31 October in an \"orderly\" fashion.",
    "articleText": "The UK’s three wealthiest persons have capitalised greatly on reports about surging stocks and the pound following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement about a fresh Brexit agreement between London and Brussels, Bloomberg reports. Fortunes of business tycoon Jim Ratcliffe, billionaire inventor James Dyson and the Duke of Westminster Hugh Grosvenor rose to a combined $1.1 billion on Thursday morning. © REUTERS / OLI SCARFF Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster speaks during the official handover of the newly built Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC), which will provide world-class rehabilitation facilities for members of the Armed Forces, on the Stanford Hall Estate in Nottinghamshire on June 21, 2018 Bloomberg Billionaires Index calculations indicate that the 28-year-old Grosvenor’s fortunes accounted for a whopping $700 million of those gains. The news outlet suggested that the hefty gains may prove “short-lived” given that the new agreement has yet to be passed by the House of Commons, where PM Johnson has lost an array of crucial votes since taking office in July. On Thursday, the pound surged to a five-month high against the dollar, coming close to $1.30, after negotiating teams from Britain and the EU struck a deal. UK PM Johnson Touts New 'Great' Brexit Deal Earlier, Johnson announced the breakthrough in the Brexit talks, tweeting that “we've got a great new deal that takes back control.” We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019 He was echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker who said that the deal was “a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.\" The deal, which still need to win the backing of the UK and European parliaments, has already been rejected by Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as \"not beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland” and something that “undermines the integrity of the Union.” Johnson, for his part, has repeatedly pledged to withdraw the UK from the EU 'with or without a deal.'",

    "description": "While UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European leaders have reached a Brexit deal in Brussels, Professor Alex de Ruyter, Director of the Centre for Brexit Studies at Birmingham City University, believes that Johnson will have a hard time getting it through the House in Commons this weekend.",
    "articleText": "Sputnik: How likely is it that this new deal will be passed on Saturday? Alex de Ruyter: I think it will be very difficult for Boris Johnson to get this deal through the Parliament, through the House of Commons. I think that the Labour Party in all likelihood will vote against it, by that I mean that I don’t think he’ll get enough support from the few MPs that might cross the floor because they represent leave voting seats. As Jeremy Corbyn has made clear, they feel that it would be too much of an infringement upon environmental standards, or workers rights, or food standards, for the simple reason that the deal, as it currently stands, gives opportunity for the UK to pursue different regulations going forward, and that’s unacceptable to the Labour Party. So, I don’t think that Boris Johnson will get enough support there. On the other side of the spectrum because it creates a hard border in the Irish sea, in effect it cuts off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK by de facto membership at the EU customs union, if not de jure for the simple reason, of course, that EU’s red lines were no hard border in Northern Ireland, settlement on the so-called divorce bill, and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens. So on two ends of the spectrum there you have the moderates, the pro-Remainers, the Labour Party at it were, in all likelihood voting it down. Johnson, of course, lacks a simple majority in the House of Commons, even with the DUP’s support, in the unlikely event he could secure it now, he still doesn’t have enough numbers, because, of course, 21 Tory MPs were expelled from the Conservative Party, and you have another handful of MPs that form Change UK (Party). So out of the 21 Tory MPs that were expelled, there’s no guarantee that they would vote for this agreement. I suspect his only chance of affecting it through the Parliament would be if progressing it was attached to a confirmatory referendum. Indeed, there was an amendment passed some time ago by two MPs Kyle and Wilson that tried to do that, I think that’s his only chance of getting it through. © AFP 2019 / KENZO TRIBOUILLARD EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker address a press conference during an European Union Summit at European Union Headquarters in Brussels on October 17, 2019. Sputnik: If the UK Parliament rejects Johnson's plan what happens next? Alex de Ruyter: Well, what happens next? I mean, this is the thing though, isn’t it? He was required under the Benn-Burt amendment to effect an agreement with the EU that Parliament would approve by 19 October, hence his plans to have a Saturday’s sitting at the House of Commons, which of course is unprecedented, where he would hope, of course, to have this deal approved. Now, if he doesn’t then my understanding is that he would then be required to seek an extension of EU membership under the provisions of that act. I don’t think he can get around it, I’m not a lawyer, so I say it without caveat, but I don’t think he could evade having to ask for an extension, and therefore the ball would then be back in the court of the other 27 EU heads of states, who might decide to grant an extension or not as it were. But the Benn-Burt Act commits the UK to ask for an extension to at least until 31 January if they cannot secure an agreement from the House of Commons to be withdrawn from the EU before then, before the 19th of course. Now Jean-Claude Juncker has come along and said that he feels that an extension should be given if Parliament doesn’t agree to the deal, but it’s not Juncker’s call to make, that’s for the other 27 heads of state. Sputnik: Is it possible that the UK will leave the EU by the end of the month? Alex de Ruyter: I don’t think it will be. I don’t think Johnson has the numbers in Parliament to effect an approved withdrawal agreement. So, no, I don’t think so. I think they’ll still be in the EU on the 1st of November. And frankly, even in the unlikely event, he did get a withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons for technical, operational and for legal details reasons it would still be required to have a brief extension anyway. So I think that the UK will still be in the EU next month. How much longer after that I’m not sure, but certainly, in those terms, I think for those reasons, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll get the agreement through Parliament, and I think that EU leaders will press for a further extension, that’s what I think. I think in a sense anything is possible. I do think that if he presents this agreement to Parliament and it is passed on the backs of a referendum, I don’t think Johnson would have a problem with that because he would probably believe that he could win one. But the situation remains fluid obviously. The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri cancelled the cabinet meeting that was scheduled for Friday afternoon in the city of Baabda in wake of mass protests, Lebanon's Al Manar news channel reported, citing the Council of Ministers.",
    "articleText": "Earlier in the day, Lebanese Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Choucair announced that a decision to impose taxes on online calls via WhatsApp and similar mobile applications would be reversed in the wake of mass protests against the measure. On Thursday, the government approved imposing a $6 monthly tax on online calls via mobile applications in a bid to raise additional funds for its debt-ridden budget. Moreover, the authorities introduced a new tax on tobacco and announced plans to increase the value-added tax (VAT) to 15 percent by 2020. The measures sparked mass protests in Beirut and other cities. According to media reports, protesters blocked off the Beirut-Damascus international highway. Lebanon has recently been rocked by anti-government protests amid a severe deterioration of the economic situation in the country. On Sunday, during a rally in central Beirut, demonstrators called for the resignation of the government, holding economic reforms and taking action to cope with corruption.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Amid the ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, Chinese technology giant Huawei has been trying to engage more closely with India by clarifying its stance on Chinese intelligence laws, 5G solutions and network security.",
    "articleText": "According to Jay Chen, the chief executive of Huawei India, 5G would be much safer than the previous networks, for only quantum computing can break into the 5G architecture, local media quoted him as saying late Thursday at The Economist's India Summit in Mumbai. Fuelling end-to-end 5G capabilities including chipset, device, cloud service and network, Huawei currently has over 1.5 million 5G base stations world over with a 28 percent global share of the telecoms equipment market. Earlier this week during a three-day India Mobile Congress in India’s capital, Jay re-asserted Huawei's previously proposed plan of entering into a “no backdoor” agreement with India to tackle the country's data privacy-related concerns. According to reports, Jay has stated currently there is no evidence suggesting Huawei has violated a security protocol and he believes that Huawei's engagement with India's Telecom Ministry has been very positive. As of now, the US has insisted India should refrain from permitting the Chinese tech company from operating 5G trials in the country citing concerns that Huawei’s telecom equipment could allegedly be used for surveillance, something which the tech giant has strongly denied. However, India, which is the second largest wireless market in the world in terms of user-base, is yet to determine if it would allow Huawei to participate in its upcoming 5G test runs scheduled for later this year. © AP Photo / Andy Wong In this July 30, 2019, file photo a woman walks by a Huawei retail store in Beijing. One of India's largest telecoms, Bharti Airtel, which has nearly 4.3 million subscribers and over 20 percent market share in the country, came out in support of Huawei earlier in October. Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal backed Huawei calling its products \"superior\" to other 5G players. Previously, to build their 2G, 3G and 4G networks, Indian telcos were helped by Huawei, as well as European companies like Nokia and Ericsson. On 14 October, Huawei claimed to have deployed India's first Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based pre-5G technology on the Vodafone-Idea network. In June this year, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government had received six proposals for 5G trials, including those from China''s Huawei and ZTE. But that Chinese vendor's participation would hinge on the recommendations of a panel looking into 5G security issues. Earlier this year, citing national security concerns, US President Donald Trump effectively banned Huawei from America, claiming the tech company was spying through its devices for the Chinese government. Both Huawei and Beijing have denied the allegations as baseless, but the US has lobbied its allies and partners, including Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Japan, New Zealand and the UK to follow suit and keep Huawei out.",

    "description": "Washington reinstated its harsh economic sanctions against Tehran last year, following President Trump’s unilateral move to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.",
    "articleText": "Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has urged the international community to stand up to Washington’s anti-Iranian sanctions, which he said ride roughshod over all countries, including the United States itself. “We hope all our friends around the world, including South Africa, will take a more decisive stance against the US illegal and inhumane actions towards the Iranian nation which even include food and medicine sanctions,” Rouhani said during a meeting with the South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor on Wednesday as cited by Iran’s Tasnim news agency. The Iranian President also condemned the US’ “economic war\" against Tehran following Washington’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Pandor lauded Iran remaining committed to the JCPOA, calling on the US to return to the deal and scrap the Iranian sanctions. Rouhani’s remarks followed his statement late last month that the US had offered to drop all sanctions against Iran in exchange for negotiations. “But this action wasn't in a manner that was acceptable, meaning that in the atmosphere of sanctions and the existence of sanctions and the toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure, even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 framework [which also includes Russia, China, Germany, France, and the UK], no one can predict what the end and result of this negotiation will be,” Rouhani pointed out. US President Donald Trump claimed at the time that it was the Iranian side which was asking for restrictions to be cancelled, but that he refused to do so. Tehran Ready for Talks With US If Washington Lifts Sanctions, Rouhani Says Earlier, Rouhani underscored that Iran is ready to hold negotiations with the United States if Washington lifts the anti-Iranian sanctions and gives up its “bullying\" policy toward Tehran. He added that Iran had shifted its approach from “strategic patience” to “reciprocal action” and would respond in kind to any of Washington’s steps related to the nuclear deal. Rouhani spoke as Berlin, Paris, and London called for a dialogue between all parties to the JCPOA, warning that the deal risks falling apart due to the US sanctions against Iran and Tehran’s decision to partially discontinue its obligations under the agreement. Iran Suspends Some of Its JCPOA Obligations On 8 May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew his country from the JCPOA and imposed several rounds of economic sanctions on Iran. Exactly a year later, Tehran announced its own decision to partially suspend some obligations under the JCPOA deal, also giving the other signatories - France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and the European Union - 60 days to save the accord by facilitating oil exports and trade with Iran. On 7 July as the deadline expired, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi announced that his country was ready to begin enriching uranium beyond the 3.67 percent level set in the JCPOA, adding that Tehran would continue to gradually abandon its nuclear commitments every 60 days.",

The album follows a religious theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of the gospel.\" Originally titled “Yandhi”, the album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018, before being delayed indefinitely. In August 2019, West's wife Kim Kardashian reannounced the album as Jesus Is King, widely anticipated to be released simultaneously with a concert film of the same name on 25 October, 2019. The American singer and songwriter has never shied away from bringing religion into his art, with his “Sunday Service” embracing his love of music, fashion, and Jesus Christ, and hailed as “hand-crafted for the social media age”.",

    "description": "The statement comes in response to the imposition of tariffs by the United States on a record $7.5 billion worth of EU goods, after the WTO ruled that EU nations gave illegal state aid to Airbus.",
    "articleText": "The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, has criticised the latest US move to increase levies on EU imports and said there was “no alternative” but to hit back with own sanctions relating to Boeing. “We regret the choice of the US to move ahead with tariffs,” Malmstrom said in a statement on Friday. “This step leaves us no alternative but to follow through in due course with our own tariffs in the Boeing case, where the US has been found in breach of WTO rules.” The EU trade chief added that US sanctions would inflict “very significant damage” to the supply chain of the aircraft sectors across the Atlantic and cause “collateral damage to many other sectors already suffering under the current trade tensions.” Rather than exchange hostilities, Malmstrom said, the EU and the US should negotiate a settlement that is “balanced and compliant with the WTO.” Commenting on the US tariffs, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz urged the EU to stay cool and avoid a new escalation. Earlier in the day, the United States introduced 25-percent tariffs on a record $7.5 billion in European agricultural and food products, including Swiss and Italian cheese, French wine and Spanish olives, as well as Irish and Scotch whiskies. An additional 10-percent tariff targeted the imports of large European civil aircraft from Europe, which mainly consist of Airbus planes. The move was made possible by the World Trade Organisation, where the US won the case against the EU over subsidies the bloc gave to Airbus. The WTO found that the EU had provided billions of dollars’ worth of illegal aid to the plane maker – the main rival of the US-based Boeing – and permitted the US to impose retaliatory tariffs, putting an end to the trade dispute which began in 2004. Following the WTO decision, European leaders said they would have to retaliate if the US went ahead with punitive measures. EU officials argue that Boeing has benefited from similar subsidies, but the parallel case against the US company is not expected to conclude before next spring.",

    "description": "The coffee barrel was said to have been among the supplies delivered to the Franz Josef Land archipelago in the early 20th century as part of a polar expedition led by American polar explorer Evelyn Briggs Baldwin and businessman William Zeigler.",
    "articleText": "Researchers from the Russian Geographical Society have discovered a well-preserved barrel of coffee beans at a long-abandoned Arctic base camp. Leonid Kruglov, a traveler and researcher, posted photos of the remnants of the abandoned base, situated on Alger Island, central Franz Josef Land, on his Instagram page. Посмотреть эту публикацию в Instagram Публикация от Leonid Kruglov Official (@leonidkruglov) 14 Окт 2019 в 8:39 PDT Kruglov wrote that the American-led expedition to the North Pole had made extensive preparations, with the 1901-1902 mission coming to include several base camps, and employing 420 Siberian huskies, 15 ponies, over 60 sleds, and two manned observation balloons. The expedition team consisted of 42 members, including Russians, Norwegians and Americans and set sail from Norway aboard a ship named The America, costing some $142,000 in 1901 dollars (about $4.2 million today, adjusting for inflation). Посмотреть эту публикацию в Instagram Публикация от Leonid Kruglov Official (@leonidkruglov) 15 Окт 2019 в 9:36 PDT During their visit to the camp, Kruglov and his colleagues reported coming across a “fearless polar bear” which proved impossible to scare away even by helicopter. “The bear was not afraid of anything. We had to use a signal flare, for the first time during this expedition, to scare it away. But the bear did not calm down and was waiting for us at the landing site,” he wrote. Посмотреть эту публикацию в Instagram Публикация от Leonid Kruglov Official (@leonidkruglov) 16 Окт 2019 в 9:58 PDT The Baldwin-Zeigler expedition ultimately aimed at reaching the North Pole, but proved a failure, with the America failing to make it to Rudolf Island due to ice conditions in 1901. The Alger Island basecamp was established in October of that year. After several more failed attempts and running out of coal supplies, explorers returned to Norway in mid-July 1902. Kruglov noted that while the remains of the Alger Island base camp were well-preserved for now, the approach of the tides means the base could be consumed by the sea in as little as two years’ time. Franz Josef Land, situated in Arkhangelsk Region in Russia’s far north, is one of the wildest and most remote corners of the Arctic, with the 16,000 square km territory having no permanent human inhabitants. The territory became part of the Russian Arctic National Park in 2012.",

    "description": "Critics of Sweden's priority to stop 'Islamophobia' have suggested that the government inadvertently runs Islamists' errands, effectively providing them with a shield from criticism.",
    "articleText": "As part of its commitment to combat 'racism', the Swedish government has commissioned the Crime Prevention Council (Brå) to conduct an in-depth study of so-called Islamophobic hate crimes. The idea behind the effort is to “highlight the nature of Islamophobic hate crimes” in order to bolster the preventive work “against racism, especially Islamophobia”. “We know that Muslims are exposed to threats and hatred in our society. It is important to increase the knowledge of Islamophobic hate crimes so that we can take powerful action. The expressions of racism have no place in our society,” Equality Minister Åsa Lindhagen of the Green Party said. Sweden's left-of-the-centre “red-green” government has made stopping the allegedly increasing threat of “radical nationalism” one of its priorities. According to the Security Police's 2018 Yearbook, “xenophobic and nationalist ideas” are on the rise, contributing to a surge in hate crimes. The security of so-called “vulnerable groups”, such as Muslims, must therefore be prioritised, the government said. All in all, the government has allocated SEK 10 million (about $1 million) for anti-racist measures in 2020. However, the government's priorities have sparked criticism. “Equality Minister Åsa Lindhagen runs Islamists' errands as she orders Brå to do a study that legitimises the concept of Islamophobia. Being critical and disliking Islam can never be a phobia. Islamophobia is simply a made-up concept. The fact that our tax money goes to fanatics' playhouse activities is scandalous,” Bassam Al-Baghdady, the chairman of the Centre for Secular Education, wrote in his opinion piece in the news outlet Nyheter Idag. According to him, Brå has been tasked with “studying something that doesn't exist” to prove it does. “Calling disapproval of an idea 'idea phobia' is an scary attempt to stamp out critics of this idea – in this case Islam – as suffering from a mental illness,” Al-Baghdady wrote. He stressed that blasphemy laws were abolished in 1949 in Sweden and suggested that it remain so. “Islamists are the only ones who will leap for joy” over this definition of Islamophobia, journalist Madeleine Lilja Rönnquist wrote. “An arbitrary use of terms with such a weak definition is therefore only favourable to those who do not want to avoid criticism or scrutiny. For Islamists, the term effectively becomes a shield against all critical questioning,” she concluded. Sweden has over 800,000 Muslims (about 8 percent of the country's population) and has consistently ranked among the best countries for Muslims by Islamicity Foundation, a US-based non-profit organisation, topping all European nations in the recent edition and trailing only New Zealand. Recently, a pro-Islam party was formed to secure Muslims' status as an official minority. In recent years, however, Sweden has been embroiled in a number of scandals involving radical Islam, involving, among others, Daesh* terrorists and extremist organisations such as the Muslim Brotherhood*. * Daesh (ISIS/ISIL/IS/Islamic State) and the Muslim Brotherhood are terrorist organisations banned in Russia and numerous other countries.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), globally mandated to combat terrorism financing and money laundering, has set a fresh deadline for Pakistan to deliver on its counter-terrorism action plan by February 2020.",
    "articleText": "Pakistan will continue to remain in the “grey list” of non-compliant countries because it has addressed only five of the 27 actionable items to rein in terror funding, an inter-governmental terror funding watchdog, the FATF, said in a statement on Friday, the last day of its five-day plenary meeting in Paris. The \"grey list\" of countries includes those nations whose domestic laws are considered weak to tackle challenges of money laundering and terrorism financing. There was unanimous consensus on keeping Pakistan in the “grey list” based on its poor performance, media reports quoted officials as saying. \"We strongly urge Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2020, otherwise should significant and sustainable progress not be made across the full range of its action plan by next Plenary, the FATF will take action including urging members to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relations/transactions with Pakistan,\" the FATF statement said. Friday’s meeting was attended by representatives from 205 countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UN, the World Bank and other organisations. Pakistan received support from three countries - China, Turkey and Malaysia - at the FATF meeting. A country needs the support of at least three other countries to avoid being blacklisted. Iran and North Korea are the only countries currently on the blacklist. The FATF placed Pakistan on the \"grey list\" in June 2018. Islamabad was then asked to complete its counter-terrorism action plan by October 2019 or face the risk of being blacklisted. If blacklisted in February, cash-strapped Pakistan’s financial condition could worsen as aid from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Union would not be forthcoming. India and several other FATF member countries have repeatedly charged Islamabad with failure to take action against UN-designated terrorists, pointing out that its anti-terror law still remains out of sync with internationally accepted standards. Earlier this month, India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval claimed that Islamabad is facing considerable pressure from the FATF to crack down on terror groups operating from its soil.",

    "description": "Turkey aside, pizza is arguably the world’s most divisive dish nowadays. There is still no consensus on whether pineapple is acceptable as a topping, and neither have pizza lovers come to an agreement on how to eat it in the neatest way.",
    "articleText": "Felix ‘PewDiePie’ Kjellberg has just added some weight to the unpopular side of the pizza debate as he revealed his “mildly infuriating” pizza-eating style. The YouTube king made the confession as he was browsing “r/mildlyinfuriating”, a subreddit dedicated to the things that annoy everyone’s inner perfectionist – whether it be a person cutting a pie not down the marked lines or a bike parked in such a way that it occupies four spots in a rack. Pewds’ attention was drawn to a photo of a woman cutting slices out of the middle of a pizza with a knife and a fork leaving out the crust. “I have a confession to make,” he began. “First of all, when I looked up this subreddit, this image shows up, ‘The way my grandmother eats pizza.’” “I’ve eaten pizza this way for over twenty years,” he continued. “And every time we’re out with friends and I start eating my pizza, it always goes weird and quiet…and everyone’s staring at what I’m doing to the pizza.” He playfully bemoaned that there is a “stigma” attached to the habit of eating pizza from the middle and added: “I don’t like the crust. And when you’re done eating it, you have a pizza frame, and you can put your face in it.” Just a quick reminder: PewDiePie’s wife Marzia hails from Italy, the birthplace of pizza. Hopefully, she will cope with this smoothly.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): The fourth highest paid actor in the 2019 Forbes’ Richest Actors list, ahead of Hollywood figures such as Jackie Chan, Bradley Cooper and Will Smith, Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar is now being trolled for his old remark.",
    "articleText": "Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar is being brutally slammed on Twitter for his comment about liking curvy girls and not the ones who look like “sucked up mangoes” from an old interview. The actor was recently lauded by netizens for his performance in Laxmmi Bomb, where he is playing a character of trans Laxmmi. The 51-year-old actor, who sponsors around 20 top Indian brands, is currently busy promoting his upcoming movie “Housefull 4”, which is latest in the Housefull series. The controversy began when an old interview with an Indian news website from 2012 surfaced on the internet. Kumar was praising actresses Sonakshi Sinha and Asin when he uttered: “She (Sonakshi) has a different figure - a typical, Indian figure and not size zero. Looks like she is from a well-off family. I am a pure Punjabi. I like heroines who are curvy. They shouldn't look like sucked up mangoes.” The remark did not go down well with a lot of netizens who took to Twitter to slam the Bollywood biggie. What in the world is wrong with you??? What kind of male chauvinism is that?? You put male Punjabis to shame. Well @akshaykumar no one likes heroes with a gummy smile like yours anyway. Freak! 🙄 https://t.co/HYJUCvbuxd — Monica (@nasheeliaankhen) October 17, 2019 He was always like this.. Ye movies n deshbhakti sab dikhava h😒...

How can you say like this nonsense ?😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬 — Ruchita (@Ruchitaa_s) October 17, 2019 However, in an interview to The Hindustan Times actress Sonakshi Sinha was quick to defend Akshay as she stated trolls really have nothing better to do in life. “… People need to understand I was body-shamed at the start of my career, and what Akshay said was probably in response to something on the same lines… I have a great friendship and working equation with him. So, he was talking about a friend and not a random person.” “If anything, he was being a gentleman and defending me with no intention of “objectifying” anyone,” she added. Akshay Kumar has been in controversies earlier as well for his previous comment. During a reality TV in 2017, his co-host Mallika Dua had made allegations against him of making an inappropriate comment, which eventually led to the superstar’s wife Twinkle Khanna apologising for it.

    "description": "Earlier this month, Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted, and then deleted, a message of support for anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong, triggering a firestorm of criticism from NBA fans in China.",
    "articleText": "China never demanded the firing of NBA executive Daryl Morey, the foreign ministry has announced. “The Chinese government has never raised these kinds of demands,” ministry spokesperson Gen Shuang told reporters in Beijing on Friday. The foreign ministry’s statement follows NBA Commissioner Adam Silver’s claim Thursday night that the league was “being asked to fire [Morey] by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business.” “We said there’s no chance that’s happening. There’s no chance we’ll even discipline him,” Silver said. Morey sparked criticism from Chinese NBA fans in early October after tweeting, and then deleting, an image captioned “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Chinese authorities, companies and fans saw the tweet as a case of interference in the country’s internal affairs, with the Rockets and the NBA subsequently losing local sponsors, and Chinese broadcasters deciding not to air a two-game exhibition tour by a pair of NBA teams. In his comments Thursday, Silver said he wasn’t quite certain where the league will “go from here,” adding that “the financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.” Silver expressed regret for “upsetting” its “hundreds of millions” of fans in China, but argued that Morey’s tweet was an expression of free speech, which he said was one of the NBA’s “American values.” The NBA’s growing popularity in China is said to net the franchise as much as $4 billion in annual revenues, comprising up to half of its total revenues of $8 billion in 2018. Hong Kong has faced mass anti-government protests since early June, when the local government announced plans to adopt a bill allowing criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. The bill was eventually squashed, but protests have continued, with protesters now demanding amnesty for their actions during the protests, and protesting the introduction of another law which bans wearing face masks during protests and other public gatherings, which was partly prompted by China's decision to roll out AI facial recognition surveillance. Western media coverage has presented the protests as a case of ‘pro-democracy protesters fighting China’s authoritarian government’. China has accused the West of ignoring the protesters’ anti-Chinese mainlander and anti-police violence, general vandalism and rioting, and has called for an end to interference in its internal affairs. Hong Kong was formally transferred back to China in 1997 after 157 years of British rule, but is governed under the ‘One country, two systems’ constitutional principle formulated by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s. Under this system, Hong Kong has been allowed to retain its distinct economic, legal and administrative system.",

And the Express puts it succinctly: “Just do it!” which says its own online poll points to a majority of voters wanting MPs to pass the deal. Daily Express front page. 18 October 2019 pic.twitter.com/1W6WlPNfYQ — Kate Lyons (@MsKateLyons) October 18, 2019 “Great New Deal” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Thursday that the country had finally reached a “great new deal” that would “#GetBrexitDone”. In hopes of meeting the 31 October Brexit deadline and avoiding a request for another extension, Johnson’s government and Brussels were able to hammer out an agreement that both sides have touted as the final withdrawal deal. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and other members of the EU echoed PM Johnson’s positive outlook on the divorce settlement as they gathered for the crunch summit in Brussels, calling it a “fair compromise between the bloc and the UK” in a statement. Ditching the “Backstop” One of the major points of the new deal regards the removal of the Northern Irish backstop and revisions that would keep the country in the UK customs territory, but also allow it to remain in the European single market. In practice, this signifies no customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but with goods checked upon entry to mainland Britain. UK officials will also check goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. A “Numbers Game” The UK Parliament is now expected to vote on Johnson’s Brexit referendum at a “Super Saturday” sitting. According to the Benn Act legislation, if the prime minister fails to muster up a majority, it will result in yet another extension of the Brexit deadline. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to support Boris Johnson’s deal, branding it worse than Theresa May’s, and intimated his party would support a motion for a second Brexit referendum. The Scottish National Party tabled an amendment to reject the deal, while the Liberal Democrats, vocal supporters of Remain, are also calling for a second referendum. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, allied with Johnson’s government, said the prime minister had made too many concessions to the EU and refused to support his deal. Saturday's showdown in the Commons is Johnson's last chance to get Parliament to approve a deal before the Brexit deadline of 31 October. If MPs reject his plans, legislation passed by MPs says he must ask the EU for an extension until 31 January 2020 - something he has repeatedly insisted he would not do.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): In July, the Asia Programme Coordinator of the committee Steven Butler wrote an article about Prime Minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Government's \"crackdown\" on the press in the Washington Post.",
    "articleText": "Pakistan authorities have deported an American journalist to Washington after he arrived at Lahore Airport to represent the global press freedom group the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Butler, the Asia Programme Coordinator for the global press freedom group, had plans to attend the Asma Jahangir Conference-Roadmap for Human Rights in Pakistan. The group said that an immigration officer at Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore told Butler that his journalist's visa is valid, but it was voided because his name was \"on an Interior Ministry stop list \". The committee added that the journalist's passport was also confiscated at Lahore airport and he was forced onto a flight to Doha, Qatar. When he arrived in Doha, authorities there, placed him on a flight to Washington. Demanding a \"full explanation\" about the incident and correcting \"this error\", Joel Simon, the CPJ's executive director has said: \"If the government is interested in demonstrating its commitment to a free press, it should conduct a swift and transparent investigation into this case.\" The Pakistani government had no immediate comment. Journalists and prominent people across the globe have questioned the attitude of the government and asked Prime Minister Khan to intervene in the incident. \"Anyone who ordered to stop entry of @StevenBButler and forced him to return to US is actually trying to tell the whole world that democracy in Pakistan is a fraud and all those who want to speak about #Press Freedom will not be tolerated-is this a new Pakistan of Imran Khan?\" Pakistan's prominent journalist Hamid Mir wrote on Twitter. We know the reason that why Govt of Pakistan refused entry of ⁦@StevenBButler⁩ and forced him to return to US his only crime was that he raised voice for #PressFreedom and wrote an article recently in ⁦@washingtonpost⁩ here is the article https://t.co/g06S4P444P — Hamid Mir (@HamidMirPAK) October 18, 2019 Amnesty International called the decision \"an alarming sign that freedom of expression continues to be under attack\" in Pakistan. \"Imran Khan boasts about the increased freedom of expression in Pakistan, and here Steven Butler of CPJ was denied entry to Pakistan despite a valid visa…These fascist acts bring a bad name to Pakistan not people like me,\" Pakistan's Human Right Activist Gulalai Ismail said.",

    "description": "The Trump administration this year effectively banned institutions funded through the federal Title X programme from referring for or performing abortions – a move decried by pro-abortion activists. The new billboard in Times Square apparently comes as part of an effort to rebuke President Trump for that widely-criticised decision.",
    "articleText": "An American sportswear company is running a graphic ad in Times Square, one of the world’s busiest places, showing President Trump hog-tied and humiliated by a female Marine Corps veteran. The billboard depicts model Michal Mesa, described in a press release as a former US Marine and a middle school teacher, standing over a screaming Trump with her bare foot on his head. He is tied up with a net featuring the colours of the American flag, against the backdrop of a storm gathering over the White House. #StandForSomething We have some big news to share with you. pic.twitter.com/VTcm8AoW5I — DHVANI (@DhvaniWear) October 15, 2019 “Perhaps now more than ever, it’s crucial we take a powerful stand against those who are determined to strip Americans of our rights. I’m proud to represent Lady Liberty and hope it inspires more people to take a stand,” Mesa said. The ad is sponsored by Dhvani, a ‘body-positive’ active-wear company based in Portland, Oregon. Dhvani has created other confrontational images, in which a woman appears to be taping Trump’s mouth shout or the President sits on a golden toilet while a woman takes away his phone. Enough is enough. #StandForSomething visit: https://t.co/tCzB9TTSvg pic.twitter.com/IiEnu1qib4 — DHVANI (@DhvaniWear) October 17, 2019 New Restrictive Abortion Rules The images are part of the firm’s #StandForSomething online campaign, protesting against sweeping changes to Title X, a 50-year-old federal programme that provides family-planning funding and health services, including cancer screenings and birth control, to low-income individuals. Over 4 million Americans received services funded through Title X last year, and four in ten of those people received their care at Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest reproductive healthcare organisation. The Trump administration in March issued a rule barring Title X recipients that perform abortions or offer abortion referrals – including Planned Parenthood – from getting federal funding under the programme. The decision was praised by pro-life groups but was immediately challenged in courts by civil rights campaigners. Planned Parenthood decided to leave Title X in August due to the regulation, which it called “unethical and dangerous,” so it could continue referring for or providing abortions. Dhvani has decided to stand with pro-abortion campaigners and says it will be giving five per cent of its gross sales through the end of the year to Planned Parenthood’s local arms. “We are proud to join Planned Parenthood in defending women from assaults on our reproductive rights,” said Dhvani’s chief communications officer, Chloe Mason. “Trump administration policies are threatening the health and bodily autonomy of women, especially women of colour, low-income women and LGBTQ women.” The company’s stunt came in for some criticism on social media, however, with sceptics accusing its controversial images of “inciting violence” and spreading “propaganda.” Haha, what a pathetic attempt to be relevant. — NeedMoreAmmo (@probethedems) October 18, 2019 Inciting violence!? — Andie 🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸 (@andiegreeneyes) October 18, 2019 This is beyond vile, and not to mention distasteful.

    "articleText": "According to the Spanish 20minutos news outlet, a total of 55 flights have been cancelled in Barcelona's El Prat airport. The majority of those are Vueling flights — 36. Iberia has cancelled 12 flights. In total, EL Prat has 979 flights scheduled for Friday, the news outlet said, 789 of which are covered by the \"minimal services\" requirement for general strikes. Earlier on Friday, a general strike began in Catalonia, which was called on by the region's pro-independence trade unions to support jailed Catalan leaders. Social services, including transportation, education and health services have been affected throughout Catalonia, but continue to operate at a decreased capacity, adhering to the government's established quota for the provision of minimal services during strikes. On Monday, Spain's Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan pro-independence leaders to prison terms ranging from nine to 13 years for organising an independence referendum on 1 October 2017. More than 90% of voters who took part in the referendum voted in favour of Catalonia's independence from Spain. Madrid did not recognise the results of the vote and arrested several Catalan leaders.",

    "description": "MOSCOW/BEIRUT, October 18 (Sputnik) – Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) deployed tear gas in the early hours of Friday in the center of Lebanon’s capital of Beirut to disperse protesters, rallying against taxes and demanding the resignation of the government, a Sputnik correspondent reported.",
    "articleText": "On Thursday, the government approved imposing a $6 monthly tax on online calls via mobile applications in a bid to raise additional funds for its debt-ridden budget. Moreover, the authorities introduced a new tax on tobacco and announced plans to increase the value-added tax (VAT) to 15 percent by 2020. The measures sparked mass protests in Beirut and other cities. The clashes between security forces and protesters occurred in Riad Al Solh Square in the heart of Beirut. Early on Friday, the ISF’s General Directorate announced that 40 security personnel were injured following the clashes. \"Freedom of speech is sacred and guaranteed by the constitution, but does that justify attacks on public and private property? Does freedom of expression allow attacks on members of the internal security forces, forty of whom have been wounded so far,\" the ISF said in a statement. Meanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri is expected to cancel the cabinet meeting for Friday, Lebanon's Mustaqbal Web news outlet reported, citing its official government source. He is also reportedly due to address the public this afternoon. Lebanese Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Choucair announced on Friday that taxes on online calls via WhatsApp and similar mobile applications would be reversed in light of mass protests against the measure. Lebanon has recently been rocked by anti-government protests amid a severe deterioration of the economic situation in the country. On Thursday, Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the country suffered from a financial blockade and sanctions.",

    "description": "While raising questions about the future of the entire region, Turkey’s operation in Kurdish-controlled areas of northeastern Syria has flared up tensions between the respective group's diaspora communities in other parts of the globe.",
    "articleText": "Denmark, where violent clashes between Turks and Kurds have occurred before, is bracing for new tension, according to the newspaper BT. Things could easily escalate once again, Deniz Serinci, a journalist with the Danish-Kurdish news outlet Jiyan, told the newspaper. “We risk a conflict flaring up between Kurds and Turks in Denmark. When it comes to war, it divides people and many have their feelings hurt,” he told BT. “People are afraid and I always take an extra look over my shoulder when I’m out making speeches,” Serdal Benli, deputy mayor of Gladsaxe Municipality, told BT. According to Kurdish-Danish resident Dana Rashid, an interpreter in from the city of Horsens, there is a great risk of civilian unrest and restaurant attacks. “There are both Turkish and Kurdish gangs who are not afraid to use violence,” she pointed out. According to Benli, the discourse on social media has never been worse than now, and things have only been escalating since the start of Turkey's Operation Peace Spring, especially within closed forums. In one Facebook group, Danish Kurds were seen sharing a video of a Turkish protester being assaulted and bullied. In another, Danish Turks praised videos of dead Kurdish soldiers and welcomed the military operation in Syria. Benli stressed that he himself has seen many cases of Kurds and Turks de-friending each another on Facebook because of differing opinions related to the conflict. Like many European countries, Denmark is no stranger to Turkish-Kurdish controversies. Last year, the Turkish embassy in Copenhagen was attacked by four Kurdish men throwing Molotov cocktails, and a month later a pro-Kurdish demonstration was assaulted by Turks. Denmark's Kurds and Turks are known for having long boycotted each other's restaurants. Often members of the opposing communities are not on speaking terms despite being neighbours. Denmark's Turkish diaspora numbers some 70,000 people and is one of the largest in the Scandinavian country. The number of Kurds is up for debate, as the newcomers are being registered according to their country of origin; Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey all have Kurdish regions. Some estimates have suggested that half of Danish “Turks” are in fact Kurds. Turkey's operation in Kurdish-dominated areas against what it views as terrorist threat, which started on 9 October, was met with widespread condemnation, including from the US, the EU and a number of Arab countries.",

    "description": "Titan’s sand dunes, which were earlier discovered by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, reach heights of almost 100 metres and spread across more than 10 million square kilometres of the Saturn moon’s surface (for comparison's sake, the Sahara Desert is 9.2 mln square kilometres in size).",
    "articleText": "Scientists have discovered new evidence suggesting that the sand dunes on Saturn’s largest moon Titan were formed by galactic cosmic rays rather than rainfall. In a study published by the journal Science Advances, researchers from the Manoa-based University of Hawaii pointed out that they made the conclusion when analysing the previous theory that Titan’s atmosphere includes certain organic molecules, made up of long chains of carbon atoms. The theory, which is based on data obtained by the Cassini space probe, claims that the organic molecules fell from the atmosphere and finally formed Titan’s dunes, which cover part of the equatorial region of the Saturn moon’s surface. CC0 Saturn The researchers, however, suggested that the dunes could have been formed by a chemical reaction, namely, the sunlight’s action on methane and nitrogen in Titan’s thick atmosphere. They tested their new theory by bombarding batches of acetylene ice, which can be found on Titan, with high-energy electrons similar to the radiation that reaches Saturn's biggest moon. During the experiment, the scientists also heated the ice until it sublimated and left behind material made of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are similar to those organic molecules thought to have created Titan's dunes. “This is against conventional wisdom, because scientists think that to form aromatic structures you need high temperatures like combustion”, the University of Hawaii’s Ralf Kaiser pointed out. The researchers believe that the new theory, which is yet to be proven, may help shed more light on why other planets and moons without an atmosphere, including Pluto and Makemake, have huge sand dunes. Ralph Lorenz at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, for his part, underscored that “bottom line, we don’t know exactly what the sand is and we don’t know how it got there”. In this vein, NASA’s plans to send the Dragonfly mission there in 2026, are expected to shed more light on Titan’s dunes.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered growth projections for the Indian economy by 90 basis points to 6.1 per cent; for a second time in seven months, in its latest World Economic Outlook.",
    "articleText": "IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday that though India has worked on the fundamentals of its economy, there are problems, including long-term drivers of growth that need to be addressed. \"In the financial sector, especially non-banking institutions, there are steps taken now to consolidate banks. They ought to help resolve some of these issues,\" Georgieva told reporters at a news conference in Washington DC. Georgieva said there has been \" very strong growth\" in India over the last years and the IMF is projecting reasonably strong growth for the country. However, \"like the rest of the world, India is experiencing a slowdown. So slightly over six per cent is what we expect to see in 2019\", she said. \"In India, what is critically important is to continue addressing the long-term drivers of growth. Investment in human capital in India is a top priority. It has to continue bringing women into the labour force. It is very important. India has very talented women, but they stay at home,\" she said. Chief IMF Economist Gita Gopinath said rising trade barriers including US-China trade and increasing geopolitical tensions are denting the growth potential. \"The global economy is in a synchronized slow down, and we are, once again, downgrading growth for 2019 to 3 per cent, its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. Growth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions. We estimate that the US-China trade tensions will cumulatively reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8 per cent by 2020,\" she said. Gopinath said the downside risks to growth, trade and geopolitical tensions, including Brexit-related risks, could further disrupt economic activity and \"derail an already fragile recovery in emerging market economies and the euro area. She warned this could lead to an \"abrupt shift in risk sentiment, financial disruptions and a reversal in capital flows\" to emerging market economies.",

Ankara will suspend military operations for 120 hours while Kurdish YPG forces withdraw from the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in the north east. Pence said that after the Kurdish forces withdraw, Turkey will completely halt all operations. Congressman Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD), who gained national attention for his principled stands on politically charged issues in the House of Representatives, his calming effect on the anti-police uprising in Baltimore and his forceful opposition to the presidency of Donald Trump, died October 17 at a hospice center in Baltimore. He was 68. Congressman Cummings was principled, dedicated, focused and consistent. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hopes of leading Britain out of the EU on October 31 are hanging in the balance Thursday, even after he secured a Brexit deal in Brussels. His deal still faces the threat that it could be killed in the House of Commons within 48 hours. The Democratic Unionist Party said it would oppose the deal, as relations between the Northern Ireland party and Johnson remain fractious. This falls into the category of: when is a deal not a deal? General Motors negotiators and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union have reached a tentative deal to end a 31-day strike by nearly 50,000 workers.

Rachid's social media post seems to have irked the fervid SRKians, who went bonkers at the sight of the picture and slammed the French national for leaving out Shah Rukh. Indian Twitter users called it an “insult” to the actor, while some called it an act of degrading the reputation of India. You don't know SRK, never heard about him and that's okay it happens, but it's not cool to crop his face. Besides he's the man who took and posted this photo.

    "description": "The Swedish star striker, one of the most decorated footballers ever, has irked his local fans by sharing a post by a notorious Islamist who has previously refused to distance himself from Daesh*.",
    "articleText": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has accused the Swedish media and Swedes in general of racism before, has sparked strong reactions with his protracted feud with the Swedish football team's national team coach Janne Andersson. In a recent interview with Expressen, Ibrahimovic attacked Andersson, claiming that he has destroyed everything he has built in 20 years and accusing him of deliberately leaving out players with a non-Swedish background, such as himself. In support of his stance, Ibrahimovic retweeted a link to an Instagram post by notorious Islamist Rashid Musa, lauding it as a “good take”. Bra reflektionhttps://t.co/HLWOWDjZAK — Zlatan Ibrahimović (@Ibra_official) 17 октября 2019 г. In his post, Rashid Musa accused coach Janne Andersson of excluding black- and brown-skinned players from team Sweden, which he called “structural racism”. Musa also attacked a number of journalists who came to Andersson's defence and suggested that he has chosen players to can take a collective responsibility, work for the team and can take directives from the coach, by accusing them of determining the players' qualities based on race and thereby applying “scientific racism”. Rashid Musa is the chairman of Sweden's Young Muslims (SUM). The organisation has previously been criticised for having links with the Muslim Brotherhood and regularly inviting anti-Semitic lecturers. In 2018, SUM lost state financing over its Islamist ties and had to pay back $1.37 million (roughly $140,000). Rashid Musa has previously refused to distance himself from Daesh. Perhaps ironically, in 2017 Rashid Musa led a seminar on Islamophobia organised by the Stockholm chapter of Swedish Social Democratic Youth League (SSU), where white people were barred from attending. Ibrahimovic's recent tweet didn't go well with his Swedish fans. “Look who you are linking to, Zlatan”, a user begged him. Läs på vem du länkar Zlatan. — 2019 (@Davidlee650) 17 октября 2019 г. “My king, if you are going to get involved in the Swedish debate, avoid from allying yourself with Rashid Musa, he is a terror apologist and is part of the Muslim Brotherhood”, another one implored. min kung om du ska engagera dig i svensk debatt ska du inte liera dig med Rashid Musa, han är terrorapologet och är en del av de muslimska brödraskapet — Kevın Kəsrəvi ن (@kasravist) 17 октября 2019 г. Others suggested that even Zlatan had “no free pass” at doing so and that he just made “his first self-goal”. “Meh. Just because Rashid did not want to distance himself from Daesh, remains an active Islamist in today's Sweden, raises money through a bunch of associations with, according to the Swedish Tax Agency, undemocratic values, this does not mean that he is not a nice person. I believe the entire issue is Islamophobic, etc.” another one tweeted sarcastically. Äsch då. Bara för Rashid inte ville ta avstånd från IS, är aktiv islamist i Sverige idag, som eskar pengar genom en drös föreningar med, enligt Skatteverket, odemokratiska värderingar, så betyder det inte att han inte är en fin människa. Jag tycker frågan är islamofobisk osv. — snʞɹɐW. 👇🏻 (@MACKL0H) 17 октября 2019 г. “Seriously! You have 6,111,003 followers, and you give exposure to Islamist Rashid Musa who represents the Muslim Brotherhood and has previously refused to distance himself from Daesh. Sick how ill-informed you are”, another one tweeted. Seriös! Du har 6 111 003 följare, och ger exponering till islamisten Rashid Musas konto som företräder Muslimska brödraskapet och har tidigare VÄGRAT TA AVSTÅND FRÅN IS.

    "description": "The British government has finally reached agreement with the European Union over a Brexit deal after weeks of negotiations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"very confident\" MPs will back the deal in a vote in Parliament on Saturday.",
    "articleText": "The managing director of Ireland’s biggest sportswear manufacturer has said Boris Johnson has “shafted” the Democratic Unionist Party and could have paved the way for a united Ireland in a few years. On Thursday, 17 October, the DUP withdrew its support for the deal only hours before it was finally agreed with the EU, saying it threatened the integrity of Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom. 👇🏻 “The Democratic Unionist Party will be unable to support these proposals in Parliament.” pic.twitter.com/zcisdSLkPy — DUP (@duponline) October 17, 2019 The deal would create a customs union on the island of Ireland which would mean the North would effectively remain within the EU and separate from the rest of the UK. Kieran Kennedy runs O’Neills, who employ 900 people on the island of Ireland - 720 of them at their factory in Strabane in Northern Ireland. © Sputnik / Chris Summers The shopfloor at O'Neills factory in Strabane He said: “The DUP has backed the wrong horse. The DUP has pushed us as a nation nearer to become a united Ireland than ever before.” Mr Kennedy, who comes from an Irish nationalist background, said he would like to see a united Ireland and he felt the DUP had been manipulated by the Conservative Party and had “played into the hands” of Sinn Fein. Charles Moore, a beef, sheep and cereal farmer in County Fermanagh, agreed: “Boris Johnson doesn’t give a toss about us….Brexit is going to be a major stumbling block. Northern Ireland is weaker within the union than it was before.” 📝 @BorisJohnson has negotiated a new deal. 👍 Now MPs in Parliament just have to back it.#GetBrexitDone#TakeBackControl pic.twitter.com/xI86vf2iaW — Conservatives (@Conservatives) October 17, 2019 Mr Moore said a lot of farm trade was carried out over the border. “Lambs from the North are usually processed and slaughtered in the Republic and then sent to Paris. My son’s lambs are processed (across the border) in Navan and I have customers come across the border to buy barley and wheat from me,” Mr Moore said. Mr Moore, a Remainer, said he believed a hardcore of English nationalists within the Conservative Party were threatening the future of the UK itself: “They’re a bunch of public schoolboys from the south of England who don’t give a toss about the periphery, including the north of England.” © Sputnik / Chris Summers A cattle market in Enniskillen He said Mr Johnson had often promoted the idea of a free trade agreement with the United States, something President Donald Trump has welcomed. But Mr Moore said: “They still use growth hormones in the US to finish their cattle. They were banned by the EU in 1981 and we don’t want them back. The average farm in Fermanagh is 100 acres but in the US the average is about 1,000 acres so they have huge economies of scale. If there was a free trade agreement we’d be wiped out by US imports. Supermarket customers would buy the cheaper beef.” 📺 Following a meeting with Tánaiste Simon Coveney this afternoon, Sinn Féin President @MaryLouMcDonald said she is 'satisfied that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland, and no veto will be given to the DUP'. #BrexitDeal pic.twitter.com/ocugASUHJF — Sinn Féin (@sinnfeinireland) October 17, 2019 He said Northern Irish farmers were also facing the loss in 2021 of EU Single Farm Payments, a subsidy which keeps some farms afloat. At the weekly cattle auction in Enniskillen on Thursday farmers from both sides of the border were present to bid for heifers, bullocks, calves and breeding cows. Arthur Ferguson, a semi-retired farmer from Lisnaskea, said: “Brexit is an awful disaster. We should have went with Theresa May’s deal in the first place. It was a good deal for everybody in this part of Ireland.” Mr Ferguson, who said he had bought and sold hundreds of animals from and to the Republic of Ireland, said: “We are being held up by the DUP who don’t give a damn about farmers or anybody else. The DUP are holding the country to ransom.” Stewart Johnston, the owner of Ulster Farmers Mart, which runs the auction, said the price of cattle has fallen by around £150 per head in the last year, partly as a result of the uncertainty over Brexit. Asked about how the new Brexit deal would affect the cattle and sheep industry, Mr Johnston said: “I’m totally confused with the whole thing. Everybody is worried and confused.” The market deals with around 700 or 800 heads of cattle a week and between 500 and 1,000 sheep. He said most of the trade is among locals but some farmers from the Republic come to buy and sell and the market accepts euros as well as pounds. Mr Johnston said: “Everybody wants a deal on Brexit and the sooner the better but we’re worried about what a deal might contain.” He said he did not want to comment on party politics because he had customers who were both DUP and Sinn Fein voters. Paul Gosling, a financial journalist and author of A New Ireland, said: “The quickest way to create a border is to make a free trade deal with the US because of their lower animal welfare standards and rules on GM crops. That stuff is not allowed in the EU and you’d need a hard border.” He said: “If you work on the assumption that supporters of Brexit want a low tax, low regulation economy then some of that is damaging to Northern Ireland because a third of our exports are food.” © Sputnik / Chris Summers Financial journalist Paul Gosling holds a copy of his book about the future of the island of Ireland But Mr Gosling said that if Northern Ireland remains inside the EU customs union while still being in the UK customs union then it could give Northern Ireland an “advantage” and that certainly seemed to be the case on Thursday with the SNP outraged at the new Brexit deal, which they fear would cause investors to opt for Northern Ireland over Scotland. In his book Mr Gosling argues it makes more sense in the long term for Northern Ireland to be part of a united Ireland within the EU. He said: “I’m not optimistic about the UK economy, while the EU is strong. The traditional reasons for not wanting to join the Republic were to do with the dominance of the Catholic Church but that is no longer the case, as you can see by the recent referendums on abortion and same sex marriages. The North is weak and dependent on financial support from the UK and with the rise of English nationalism that subsidy is unlikely to be there for ever.” Mr Gosling said the main obstacle to the unification of Ireland, apart from the opposition of a loyalist paramilitary hardcore, was the absence of a national health service in the Republic, something which is cherished in the North. Mr Kennedy said if the deal creates a customs union on the island of Ireland he welcomed it because it would allow him to continue his business unfettered. “We import multifibre yarn from China through the port of Dublin, it is then brought across the border to Strabane and processed and sent back to Dublin. Between yarn and finished product it crosses the border eight times,” Mr Kennedy said. © Photo : O'Neills Kieran Kennedy talks to Boris Johnson “I am old enough to remember when I started out here as a van driver in 1979 and I had to fill in customs forms and take them to the British customs post in Strabane and then stop at the Irish customs post in Lifford. The 14 mile journey to Letterkenny would take me three hours,” he said. Mr Kennedy said: “The DUP does not speak for Northern Irish businesses or the majority of people in Northern Ireland. For the DUP Theresa May’s deal was better because it did not have a border in the Irish Sea. Everybody knew that Boris was going to shaft them. It was just a matter of time.”",

    "description": "A new legal bid is seeking to effectively suspend the withdrawal agreement just one day before lawmakers are set to have a say on it.",
    "articleText": "An Anti-Brexit campaigner has filed a petition with Scotland’s top civil court to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from getting his newly-approved deal through Parliament. Jolyon Maugham QC, who had earlier launched legal action in the Court of Session to force Johnson to seek a Brexit extension in the event of no deal, lodged the new petition with the same court on Thursday. What’s in Johnson’s new Brexit deal? Johnson reached a last-minute compromise with the European Union on Thursday. The deal, if approved, will see Northern Ireland leave the EU customs union along with the rest of the UK. However, Northern Ireland will remain aligned with EU single market rules on industrial products and agricultural goods. In practice, this means there will be no customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but goods will be checked upon entry to mainland Britain. UK officials will also check goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Taxes won’t be automatically payable on these goods, but if there is something “at risk” of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland (and hence the EU customs union), a duty will have to be paid. Why is it an issue for Remainers? Jolyon Maugham argues in the petition that Northern Ireland will therefore effectively become part of the EU customs territory, however Johnson’s deal defines it, and will be separated from the rest of the UK because of the imminent customs and import controls down the Irish Sea. Maugham calls this stipulation “unlawful” and is seeking a court order preventing Boris Johnson from placing his deal before parliament for approval. “If the proposed Withdrawal Agreement is unlawful, the Government will be obliged to request an extension as mandated by the Benn Act,” the campaigner tweeted on Wednesday. If the proposed Withdrawal Agreement is unlawful, the Government will be obliged to request an extension as mandated by the Benn Act and in accordance with undertakings given to the Court of Session in Vince, Maugham, Cherry v Boris Johnson. — Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) October 16, 2019 What next for Brexit? The court is expected to hear the case today and sit again in the evening for an appeal. MPs are set to gather on Saturday to vote on whether to approve the agreement. The Conservative Party’s allies in the DUP have already rejected the deal, while the SNP has tabled an amendment to reject the deal and call for a three-month Brexit extension to allow for an early election. The Labour Party isn’t going to back the deal either. MPs in September passed a piece of legislation, known as the Benn Act, forcing Boris Johnson to ask the EU for a Brexit delay if he fails to get enough support for his deal. The move came in response to Johnson’s repeated pledges to deliver Brexit by the 31 October deadline, whether or not there's a deal by that time. Anti-Brexit campaigners earlier sought an injunction from the Court of Session, instructing the prime minister to comply with the law, but the court has delayed its decision until Saturday.",

    "description": "New Delhi (Sputnik): Advanced two-dimensional graphene-like materials are proving to be exceptionally useful in miniaturising electronics, with a potential for replacing bulky devices made from silicon or germanium.",
    "articleText": "Indian scientists have developed a computational tool to evaluate the performance of advanced graphene-like two dimensional (2D) materials. It helps pre-evaluate the performance of advanced materials and checks their suitability for a device before manufacturing them. This helps understand a material’s electro-physical properties before the device is fabricated, saving time and money, and there is a high demand for such tools. The sophisticated tool can predict along which directions some 2D materials could display minimal scattering, thereby improving the performance of nanoscale devices, said the scientists involved in the development of the tool. “In the semiconducting channel of a device such as a transistor, electrons (hole) carriers transport the charge (and information encoded within the charge) from the input to the output end. The phonons interact with carriers during this transport and create ‘resistance’, which affects the performance aspects such as drive current and the speed of operation. The strength of such interaction is material-specific, and thus it is crucial to understand when we plan to design transistors fabricated with 2D materials,” explained Dr Santanu Mahapatra, team lead of the study, and professor at the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science, while speaking to India Science Wire. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Applied Physics. The study offers one such model to evaluate the electron-phonon interactions in the material. In a semiconductor, at the quantum level, two systems exist, the electron-hole charge carriers and another system called phonon, that originates from the lattice vibrations. Electron-phonon coupling limited transport is a complex process, and in this study, the low-energy two-band model was used for computations. The team employed a software tool called VASP to analyse the energy band structure of different materials. They developed the extensive software code by using Hybrid C and MATLAB programming styles. The scientists demonstrated the performance of a phosphorene based MOSFET (building blocks of ICs) using the simulated model. The atomic structure of the material has a web-like distribution where the atoms are patterned in a sequential form (called the armchair format) and also in a zig-zag fashion. They observed that for phosphorene, electron-phonon scattering is more pronounced in the zig-zag direction.",

    "title": "Our World, Not Just America, Needs Bernie Sanders",
    "description": "All of my adult life I have been a socialist who believes implacably in the inherent goodness, compassion and empathy which underlines and defines humanity.",
    "articleText": "Of course darkness and evil lurks constantly and seeks to eclipse the kindness and care which makes life beautiful and sustainable but in that struggle between good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice it often takes courage, vision and stamina to stand up for the persecuted, the voiceless, the minority or the dispossessed. The powerful have everything going for them. They have the wealth, the social status, the authority, the corporate media platform. They have the power. Those of us seeking to fundamentally change society are disadvantaged but we must never give up or give in. One man who epitomises that struggle for progressive change in society right now is American Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders. While many across the world look to the most powerful and richest nation on the planet and see nothing but the darkness of thunder under Trump, increasing numbers both within and outwith the US see instead the rainbow of Sanders. A man who has been on the right side of the people and actively opposed to social injustice all his adult life which has included holding public office since 1981 when he was elected Mayor of Burlington. Most of the time Bernie Sanders has operated outside the rotten well of two-party politics which pollutes America and won election as an Independent and a declared democratic socialist. He has won election after election with hefty majorities because he speaks truth to power and refuses to bend the knee and play the tune of establishment dogma demanded by the corporations who effectively run America and American politics. Often the differences in substance between Republican and Democratic candidates are either minute or non-existent. Both tend to be millionaires backed by billionaires and always they defend the status quo of obscene wealth and power inequalities which scar America. While Barack Obama talked a good game and delivered some excellent speeches, his domestic record on tackling the tax-dodging billionaires and corporations was woeful while his overseas record in relation to illegal bombings, use of deadly drones and killing of innocents was downright criminal. The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner illustrated just how grubby and tarnished that award is when the Obama record of bombings in 2016 alone revealed that his administration had dropped at least 26,171 bombs on at least 7 countries with civilian death tolls running into thousands. In other words, the gentle Obama, so-called dove of peace, managed to drop 72 bombs a day, 3 bombs an hour, 24 hours a day in his last year of office alone. No wonder so many supporters in 2008 had become deeply disillusioned in him by 2016. He became a jackal of war while in the White House and continued the US tradition of ignoring international law in relation to military interventions and treating civilians as legitimate targets. His Secretary of State during some of his bloodiest escapades was Hilary Clinton. She proved to be gung-ho with thousands of innocent lives abroad, including thousands of women who either perished or survived to be battered, raped and/or sold into slavery on the back of the wholly irresponsible and illegal bombing of Libya and support for jihadists groups who opposed Gaddafi but also opposed human rights and freedoms for women. Some feminist Libyan bomber Hilary turned out to be… On the back of disillusion with Obama and the realisation that Hilary Clinton represented nothing more than the American Establishment, it is little wonder that major sections of the American working class, black and white, refused to campaign or vote for Hilary Clinton. Sure she won more votes than Trump the millionaire reactionary with no political experience or track record but his claim to be different and not part of the cosy Washington Establishment Elite played well across the country in areas and communities largely left behind and condemned to survive on low wages, insecure jobs, failing public services and a disgracefully inadequate health service. Trump correctly characterised the political elites as a swamp of nepotism, privileged entitlement and wanton disregard for the plight of the struggling working class. He consistently pledged to ‘drain the swamp’. It was a popular pledge but one he could never deliver as he emerged from and lives in that very swamp of insulated wealth and power. Clinton was the wrong candidate to take on Trump. It should have been Bernie Sanders. He fought a tremendous campaign to secure the Democratic nomination in 2016. He was roundly dismissed by the Democratic machine and the elites scoffed at his efforts. However, his radical demands for living wages, universal healthcare and radical taxation of the rich and corporations engendered huge support and enthusiasm from rank and file Democratic Party supporters, particularly young supporters. From an outsider he became a serious contender and although he eventually ran Clinton close and took 43% of the delegate votes to her 55% it has now been admitted that the vote was actually rigged against him and Clinton only won the nomination on the basis of Democratic Party bosses cheating to stop Sanders becoming the Presidential candidate, a fact that Party now desperately tries to deny. Today Sanders carries the hopes and aspirations of millions on his shoulders. He really is the man of the moment, the man who could not only take on and beat Trump but actually tackle the atrocious inequalities which infect American society like cancer. This is a man who oozes integrity, honesty, intellect and courage to match his convictions. The corporate media and Democratic bosses are anxious to undermine his chances of securing the Democratic Party nomination at every turn. They constantly promote Joe Biden instead, a man steeped in Establishment toxins and tarnished by his record on race and time in office as Obama’s Vice-President. Biden is the perfect candidate for Trump. He will be portrayed as part of the Washington swamp Trump pledged to drain. Sanders, on the other hand, will swat Trump like a troublesome mosquito. He will expose him as the privileged son of the elites who never had to struggle a day in his life as everything was laid on a plate for him. He inherited and then squandered millions and bankrupted several businesses. His record of treatment of workers is disgraceful. His practice of serial lying is now a matter of fact with his number of outright lies or seriously misleading claims now numbering more than 10,000. Sanders is 78 years of age and would be the oldest President to ever be elected. At the start of October, he had a heart attack and many have rejoiced in that health scare. It will be used against him throughout the Democratic nomination campaign. Sure he is older than others seeking the nomination but his energy, enthusiasm and commitment remains undaunted and makes the issue an irrelevance. Within a week of his heart attack and the placing of two stents to improve the arterial flow of blood to his essential muscle he was able to report a remarkable third-quarter total of $25.3 million raised for his campaign, more than any other candidate. The total is not just remarkable because of the size it is even more remarkable because he refuses corporate donations and targets individual small donations and contributions from progressive campaigns and trade unions. The single most common occupation recorded on the individual donations is “teacher” and the three most common employers of the individual donors are Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart. Those are three of the big companies Sanders has outed and shamed for paying below living wages while continually paying little or no tax on their billions of profits. Sanders is securing real and tangible support from the working class of America. The low paid Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart employees see him for the honest and true politician he is and are willing to financially support him despite their low wages. The fact so many hard-working and stressed teachers are also backing him is testimony to the vision he promotes and the hope he offers. His campaign video is awesome and inspiring. He uses his heart attack to illustrate the urgent need for a universal healthcare system for everyone to replace the current insurance-based system which denies millions any cover and makes billions for insurance companies and drugs companies but fails ordinary citizens. He also brilliantly contrasts his health adversity with the much worse adversity faced every day by the 500,000 homeless who literally sleep on the streets across America and the tens of millions struggling to survive on inadequate wages daily. Bernie Sanders is a clever, compassionate and courageous socialist who would make a brilliant American President. No wonder the most radical and progressive sections and leaders of the Democratic Party are endorsing him enthusiastically. For the sake of America and the world, I sincerely hope he secures the Democratic nomination and goes on to win the 2020 November election and brings light where there is currently darkness, compassion where there is currently intolerance and love where there is currently hate.

    "articleText": "During a speech at his campaign rally in Dallas, Texas on Thursday, US President Donald Trump specifically mocked Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’ “flailing” counter-campaign. “I called him right, remember, the flailing arms. Nobody noticed it, I noticed it. The flailer - remember he was flailing all over the place”, Trump said, waving his hands around. He slammed O’Rourke as a “very dumb” person over the 47-year-old’s drive to campaign on taking away semi-automatic rifles from US gun owners and revoking the tax-exempt status of religious organisations. On Thursday, O'Rourke asserted that any religious group that does not support gay marriage should not be tax exempt, insisting that “there can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, or any institution, any organisation in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us”. Almost all netizens have, meanwhile, berated Trump for his mocking O’Rourke, claiming that he “has no policy to speak of\", and that he is “undermining our nation”. pic.twitter.com/cCEVnPWhzX — Cameron Fox (@Cameron_Fox) October 18, 2019 Oh, we noticed *your* flailing arms. pic.twitter.com/7loNXVNsnx — Nord Allen (@nord_allen) October 18, 2019 pic.twitter.com/aA3SFoMKu8 — Daniel Finaldi (@Danartman) October 18, 2019 Trump has no accomplishments so he has to focus on other people.

Constantly attacking Dem. candidates. What is he so afraid of. A lot I hope,” one user tweeted. Trump started to mock O’Rourke for his “crazy” hand movements while speaking shortly after the Democratic candidate announced his campaign in March. “I think he’s got a lot of hand movement. I’ve never seen so much hand movement. I said, ‘Is he crazy or is that just how he acts?’ I’ve never seen so much hand movement. I watched him a little while this morning […] I’ve actually never seen anything quite like it. Study it. I’m sure you’ll agree,” he told reporters at the time. Last week, O'Rourke, who is earning just about 3 percent in national polls, said that the US House of Representatives should vote on impeachment so that Trump could not use it as a “talking point”. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced impeachment proceedings against the US President on 24 September , following Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Trump is accused of piling pressure on Zelensky to prod him to investigate 2020 election presidential candidate Joe Biden during the call, an allegation that POTUS vehemently denies.",

    "title": "Erdogan Has Huge Leverage Over EU That Has Led Many Gov'ts to 'Tone Down' Their Criticisms  - Prof",
    "description": "As German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Thursday that Berlin would not deliver any arms to Turkey in the wake of Ankara's operation in northeast Syria, Berk Esen, Assistant Professor of International Relations at Bilkent University, has expressed his opinion on how the decision may affect relations between the two countries.",
    "articleText": "Sputnik: Angela Merkel has said that Berlin will not deliver any arms to Turkey in the wake of its operation in Syria. How may this affect overall Turkish-German relations? Berk Esen: Due to the migration crisis, the Erdogan administration holds a huge leverage vis-a-vis the EU, and that has led many Western governments to tone down their criticisms in recent years. However, the operation seems to have unified the West in its opposition to the Erdogan government. Thus, this decision will widen the political rift between Turkey and Germany. The two governments clashed with each other in recent years due to the latter country's support for Gulenists and criticism of Turkey's democratic backsliding. In the past, Merkel tried to moderate her government's approach towards Turkey due to the Syrian migration crisis but an overwhelmingly negative German public opinion has made this difficult. Such moves make reconciliation between the two sides very difficult, especially when both public opinions turn so negatively towards each other. Sputnik: What countermeasures could Ankara implement after this ban? Berk Esen: Ankara has two primary options at its disposal. As it has done in recent years, it could turn towards alternative suppliers which sell weapons without any political criteria, such as Russia and China. I suspect we may see further rapprochement between [Turkey and Russia], especially if Trump administration decides to widen the sanctions on Turkey. Moreover, Erdogan government can and probably will push for a higher degree of self-sufficiency in Turkish defence sector. Ironically, Turkish defence industry had initially emerged in the 1970s when the US Congress placed sanctions on Turkey for its Cyprus policy. Sputnik: There have been reports that Berlin's weapons sales to Turkey have reached their highest level in 14 years. In your view, can Germany's stance on Turkey's operation in Syria influence this surge? Berk Esen: Germany is Turkey's main supplier of modern tanks and that has contributed to the increase in Berlin's weapons sales to Turkey. If it were to continue, the current ban can really hurt the Turkish military capability, especially in the short term. Sputnik: What impact can this have on President Erdogan’s rhetoric regarding the operation itself? Berk Esen: Erdogan is a playing a two-level game. He is trying to generate public support for his regime through the operation, while also expanding Turkey's influence in Syria so as to have a stronger bargaining position vis-a-vis Syria. Ultimately, these bans do not change the Turkish public opinion's opinion, so Erdogan does not have an incentive to back down, though we will see the operation lose some steam. Sputnik: How popular is this operation in Northern Syria among the public in Turkey? Berk Esen: Its difficult to say definitely how the Turkish electorate feels about the operation without an opinion survey. However, based on the public outcry against Western sympathy towards the SDF, one could suggest that the operation itself is quite popular. The Turkish public overwhelmingly sees the YPG to be linked organically to the PKK terrorist organisation and finds the prospect of a Kurdish autonomous zone in northern Syria a threat towards Turkey. Therefore, I think the operation is quite popular and the Western opposition may have hardened this stance. All mainstream opposition parties came out in support of the military operation. The high level of international resistance towards the operation, not to mention the US sanctions and EU arm sale bans, will further increase the political risks in the country.

    "description": "Earlier, the United States and the European Union had been rallying allies to send ships to the region after a string of attacks on commercial vessels took place earlier this year, which the US has blamed on Iran. Tehran has vehemently denied the allegations.",
    "articleText": "The Japanese government has decided to send its own self-defence troops to the Strait of Hormuz area as an alternative to joining the US-coalition to protect commercial vessels passing through key Middle Eastern waterways, according to the Asahi newspaper. Earlier, media reported that Japan would not join such a coalition due to its close economic ties with Iran, as an important oil producer. The US announced the creation of a naval coalition in the wake of the detention of a British tanker by Iranian authorities over alleged violations of maritime laws and a series of \"sabotage attacks\" on commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf. These it blamed on Iran, claiming that the US goal will be to ensure the safety of navigation through a crucial oil-exporting lane - the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran has strongly denied any involvement in the attacks. Washington invited several countries from Europe and Asia to participate in this coalition, but so far few have responded. While the UK has shown interest in participating in the American mission, Germany opted for diplomatic efforts as a mean to reduce tensions in the Gulf and stated that its participation in America's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran has been \"ruled out\". Iran has slammed the planned American maritime mission as endangering the international waterway and expressed scepticism about Washington's chances of rallying allies for it.",

    "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign lashed out at Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday over a speech where the Facebook CEO defended his company's decision not to remove political adverts containing what is alleged to be false information.",
    "articleText": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has offered his opinion in response to calls for social media companies to suspend US President Donald Trump's activities on social media platforms such as Twitter, as he gave an exclusive interview on Fox News’s \"The Daily Briefing\". Zuckerberg said: \"My belief is that in a democracy, I don’t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news.\" Zuckerberg was asked about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand earlier this month that Twitter shut down Donald Trump's account. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate had cited the president's tweets against the whistle-blower, who revealed details of his call with the Ukrainian president and his posts slamming members of Congress. The CEO of the social-networking website Facebook emphasised that Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions. \"I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for. And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing,\" said the American technology entrepreneur in the interview airing Friday at 2 PM ET. In connection with Facebook’s recent decision to update its policies for political and social issue ads ahead of 2020 elections, Mark Zuckerberg responded to criticism of his platform from another Democratic presidential candidate. Last week Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account had tweeted that it had called the company’s bluff by creating a \"Facebook ad with false claims\" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it. Warren's team claimed Facebook had \"changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies — explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.\" Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies—explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 12, 2019 In the Fox News interview, Zuckerberg stressed that it is important for Americans to \"think for themselves\" about what politicians say. \"Political speech is one of the most scrutinised [forms of] speech that is out there, so that’s already happening. Our position on this is not an outlier,\" stated Zuckerberg. On Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign targeted Mark Zuckerberg over a speech where the Facebook CEO defended his company's decision not to remove political adverts containing allegedly false information. “Facebook has chosen to sell Americans’ personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,” read a statement by Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for the Biden campaign. \"Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company’s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.” The comments followed a livestreamed speech made by Zuckerberg at Georgetown University where he argued that it is not Facebook's responsibility to regulate political content. Zuckerberg and Facebook had to deal with a backlash after the speech, especially after President Trump’s reelection campaign published a $1 million ad targeting Biden and accusing the former vice president of abusing office to pressure Ukrainian officials to stop a corruption investigation into his son Hunter Biden. © AP Photo / Visar Kryeziu U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden (File) House Democrats launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump in September following accusations that in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he had pressured the foreign leader to investigate corruption allegations targeting Joe Biden and his son. Trump has rejected all accusations levelled against him as a political “witch hunt”.",

    "description": "Boris Johnson hammered out a last-gasp agreement with the fatigued EU negotiators on Thursday, and is facing the task of getting lawmakers’ approval on the document tomorrow. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party and N. Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party have already rejected the deal, so this task may prove to be daunting, if not impossible.",
    "articleText": "Former UK prime minister David Cameron believes Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be able to get his hard-fought withdrawal agreement through Parliament. Britain’s former prime minister was talking at a hotel in North Yorkshire on Thursday to promote his new book, For The Record, when he was asked whether he and Johnson had nicknames for one another. David Cameron said that a friend had texted him earlier that day to ask about the prospects of Johnson’s Brexit deal, to which he responded: “The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.” Cameron – who held the EU referendum in 2016 as prime minister despite campaigning against leaving the bloc – said he would vote for the deal if he was still an MP to avoid a no-deal Brexit. “The country voted to leave the European Union, the best way to leave is with a deal; I think a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the economy and bad for the union,” he told the audience. “I think it’s much better to leave with a deal, and I think Boris has done well to achieve that deal. I hope he’ll get it through parliament, I suspect he will but it will be tight.” He described the just-agreed-upon version of the withdrawal agreement as coming close to what was promised in the Conservative Party’s 2017 election manifesto. However, he said, a general election or even a second referendum would likely follow if parliament voted the deal down. Johnson secured a last-minute compromise with EU negotiators on Thursday, and it now needs the approval of both the UK and European parliaments. All eyes are now on the House of Commons, which will vote on the agreement tomorrow. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to support Boris Johnson’s deal, saying that it appeared worse than Theresa May’s – which failed to slip past Parliament three times – and hinted that his party would support a motion for a second Brexit referendum. The Scottish National Party has tabled an amendment to reject the deal, while the Liberal Democrats, vocal supporters of Remain, are also calling for a second referendum and have made it clear they would endorse a divorce agreement only if Britons vote Leave a second time. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, allied with Johnson’s government, said the prime minister had made too many concessions to the EU and refused to support his deal. The European Union may agree to an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline if MPs reject it. Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed to take Britain out of the EU whether or not there is a deal on the table by that date, but any attempt to deliver on that promise would likely by challenged in court.",

    "description": "US Army Col. Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the US-led coalition has revealed that two US fighter jets launched pre-planned airstrikes Wednesday to destroy ammunition that was left behind when American forces left a cement factory south of Kobani, Syria.",
    "articleText": "Last time American troops destroyed ammunition was when they were fleeing Vietnam, according to Alexander Azadgan, Editor-at-Large with the United World International analytical centre. Mr. Azadgan, who’s also a Professor of International Political Economy described Washington’s foreign policy in the Middle East as “an embarrassment”. “The last time [...] such extreme actions were taken is when the US was fleeing from Vietnam. And we all remember the image of helicopters being thrown off or pushed out from the US aircraft carrier. So from a symbolic perspective, it doesn't look good,” the Professor said. “Of course, we've all known that US foreign policy has failed miserably, not just in Syria, but from Afghanistan all the way down to Yemen and elsewhere. So, it's not a common practice, it is an embarrassment to our foreign policy in the Middle East…” This comes after US President Donald Trump declared on 6 October that the US is withdrawing troops from northern Syria and this week confirming that all US forces are coming home. But Prof. Azadgan believes that there won’t be a complete pullout from Syria despite the US leader’s statements and that some special forces units will remain. \"I think there's going to be a US presence in the east of Euphrates, which is very controversial, even though they say they're not going to help the Kurds. There has been withdrawal in other parts of the Middle East by US personnel, but this area is so strategic to everybody that the US would want to have some kind of, perhaps, a covert presence there. We don't need to have thousands of soldiers when you have special forces operatives. Their numbers could be very few, but they're extremely effective,\" the scholar explained. Tensions continue to mount in Syria after Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring against Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) forces in northern Syria last week with the stated aim of protecting itself from terrorists, creating a safe-zone along its border with Syria and resettling refugees back in their homeland. © Sputnik / Hikmet Durgun Smoke billows from fires on targets in Syria Ankara has maintained that it is only fighting the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, a terrorist organisation in Turkey, and the remnants of Daesh*. Turkey’s offensive has been met with strong criticism in the US and Europe. The US introduced sanctions on Turkey that include sanctions on individual ministers and a 50% tariff on Turkish steel exports to the US. The leaders of France and Germany announced that they have halted arms deliveries to Turkey in the wake of its operation in Syria. But Azadgan stressed that US allies in the region have all been defeated for the most part. \"I think Russia is coming in and trying to save face for everybody. Russia is trying to create an atmosphere where everyone feels they have defeated the bad guys - that being ISIS [Daesh], al-Qaeda, al-Nusra. ... So, what you can expect from Washington's allies in the region is a quiet, unacknowledged defeat of their proxies. And everybody right now is trying to create a perception that we defeated ISIS [Daesh], all of us defeated ISIS [Daesh] - and this is totally false. It was the United States double supporting al-Qaeda, which they called the Syrian opposition, as well as al-Nusra,\" the Professor pointed out. When it comes to the Turkish military operation, Mr. Azadgan says it’s certainly no coincidence that Ankara began its operation when the US and allies were withdrawing and it may actually be interested in making things even worse in Syria. \"I think Mr. Trump, and quite possibly other warmongers in his cabinet, that being Mike Pompeo, are subcontracting the job of creating further chaos and anarchy in Syria as if that country wasn't already in such a horrible state, they're simply allowing him to do it,\" he said. The analyst also described German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s statements about Europe’s weapons sales embargo as “a perfect geopolitical game of hypocrisy,” noting that it’s “irrelevant” as the US has been selling F-35s and other advanced technologies to Turkey for many years.” Merkel has also urged Ankara to end its operation in northern Syria. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to press on with the offensive, so “we have to see how far the Turks can go with this new plan of extinguishing the Kurds,” Prof. Azadgan stressed. © AP Photo / Burhan Ozbilici Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gestures as he addresses his ruling party legislators at the Parliament, in Ankara, Wednesday, Oct 16, 2019. Kurds, left to fend for themselves, struck a deal with the Syrian government asking the Syrian army to help hem fend off Turkey's offensive. \"Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, was on record telling the Kurds that they cannot rely on anybody and that at the end - he said this many years ago - that at the end they will come back to the arms of Syria and ask Syria to protect them,\" Azadgan noted. According to Syrian state media reports, on Thursday, President Bashar Assad promised to respond to Turkish aggression on any part of its territory with all legitimate means available. The US has been pushing Turkey to declare an immediate ceasefire, and US Vice President Mike Pence travelled to Ankara on Thursday to urge President Erdogan to stop its operation in northern Syria. * Daesh (ISIL/ISIS/IS/Islamic State) is a terrorist organisation banned in Russia The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",

    "description": "MEXICO CITY (Sputnik) – Mexico’s security council will convene in the city of Culiacan to control a security operation against a criminal group that attacked law enforcement officers and provoked unrest, the country’s Security and Public Protection Secretary, Alfonso Durazo, said amid reports that a son of a notorious drug lord was detained there.",
    "articleText": "\"We decided to move to Culiacan to control the situation in person,\" Durazo wrote on Twitter late on Thursday. On Thursday, media reported that Ovidio Guzman Lopez, one of the sons of drug lord Joaquin Guzman, also known as El Chapo, was captured in Culiacan following a shoot-out between law enforcement officers and members of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was previously led by El Chapo. His son is believed to currently have one of the key roles in the group. However, media subsequently reported, citing Durazo, that the officers had to let the man go. Earlier, the authorities cancelled classes in kindergartens, schools and universities amid gun battles in Culiacan, which left nine people injured. The city residents and Mexican lawmakers asked for explanations from the authorities. Durazo said that a group of officers had been attacked on Thursday while on a patrol mission in one of the city’s districts. The officers repelled the attack, got control over the building and found four people, including Ovidio Guzman Lopez, there. Several gangs subsequently came and surrounded the house, while other \"carried out acts of aggression\" across the city, provoking panic among the public. Media reported late on Thursday, citing Durazo, that the officers let Ovidio Guzman Lopez go in order to protect lives. El Chapo’s son is reportedly wanted in the United States on various drug-related charges. Guzman himself faced several court trials but repeatedly managed to escape justice. However, he was captured in 2016 and extradited to the United States in 2017. In July, a US federal judge sentenced him to life in prison plus 30 years on various charges related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel.",

According to a Norwegian pundit, violence and vandalism associated with the protests can make a peace award more problematic.",
    "articleText": "China has called for foreign governments not to interfere in its affairs after a Norwegian politician nominated “the people of Hong Kong” for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize. “I have nominated the people of Hong Kong, who risk their lives and security every day to stand up for freedom of speech and basic democracy, for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize,” Guri Melby, a Nowegian MP and a member of the Liberal party tweeted. Jeg har nominert Hongkong-befolkningen til fredsprisen i 2020 fordi de kjemper for grunnleggende rettigheter som ytringsfrihet, demokrati og rettssikkerhet.

I recently visited Hong Kong, where I was appalled by the stories of police brutality and impressed by the courage of the protesters: pic.twitter.com/vlUjTgOXuO — Guri Melby (@gurimelby) 16 октября 2019 г. Melby is hopeful that the nomination will “encourage the people of Hong Kong's fight for freedom and democracy”. She also suggested that what the protesters do “has an impact far beyond Hong Kong, both in the region and in the rest of the world”. In response, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang urged the “relevant people” to be “objective and just”, as well as “cautious”. “Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and no foreign government or individuals have the right to interfere,” Geng said. Meanwhile, Norwegian pundits have warned that the award will be seen as a provocation. China researcher Harald Bøckman at the University of Oslo suggested that the protests are “not yet in the Nobel class”. “Such an award will be perceived very similar to that of 2010 and at least as provocative,” China expert Henning Kristoffersen told the news outlet ABC Nyheter. “The prize to Hong Kong activists will be perceived by Chinese authorities as interference with China's internal affairs. It is a red line for China and something the authorities do not accept,” Kristoffersen suggested. Kristoffersen also pointed out that violence and vandalism associated with the Hong Kong protests can make a peace award more problematic. In recent months protests that originally sparked by a later-dropped bid to allow extraditions to mainland China, spiralled into broad anti-China and anti-police riots, which resulted in the worst political crisis since 1997 when Hong Kong was formally transferred to China after 157 years of British rule. In recent decades, Beijing has had a rather strained relationship with the Nobel Committee. Following the the 2010 award that was handed to Chinese dissident and Tiananmen protests veteran Liu Xiaobo, who later died of cancer in 2017, Beijing froze its relations with the Scandinavian country, suspended negotiations for a free trade agreement and blocked imports of Norwegian salmon, prompting Norwegian politicians to react. In 2016 Oslo pledged not to support actions that “undermine Chinese interests”, angering local peace activists and promoters of democracy. Earlier, in 1989, the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader whom Beijing accuses of trying to split China, was awarded the peace prize.",

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - French law enforcement agencies have arrested a man suspected of plotting a 9/11-style terrorist attack, the France Info radio station reported, citing Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.",
    "articleText": "The suspect, who was \"inspired\" by the September 11 attacks and planned to hijack a plane, was arrested last month, the minister said on Thursday. According to Castaner, it became the 60th foiled terrorist plot in France since 2013. Police sources reportedly said that the suspect was a 30-year-old French living in the Hauts-de-Seine department. In 2001, terrorists from al-Qaeda* hijacked four passenger planes, crashing two of them into the World Trade Center in New York and another into the Pentagon. The fourth jet came down in a field in Pennsylvania after being initially directed toward Washington. Some 3,000 people from 90 countries lost their lives in the terrorist attacks. *Al-Qaeda is a terrorist group banned in Russia",

    "description": "Earlier, Ankara and Washington agreed to suspend the Turkish operation in Syria for 120 hours to facilitate the withdrawal of the Syrian Kurdish militia forces to a distance of about 30 kilometres (some 20 miles) from the border with Turkey.",
    "articleText": "Speaking at a campaign rally in Dallas on Thursday, US President Donald Trump again praised efforts by Vice President Mike Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to clinch a ceasefire in Syria. “Sometimes you have to let them fight. Like two kids in a lot, then you pull them apart”, Trump told a campaign rally in Dallas, referring to Kurdish and Turkish forces. After these forces “fought for a few days, we went there and we said, ‘we want a pause’,” the US President explained. Trump went on to say that “Turkey is a fellow NATO ally of the US”, while “the Kurdish forces known as the YPG were vital in the fight against ISIS [Daesh*]”. \"President Erdogan was a gentleman, he understood. But without a little tough love […] they would’ve never made this deal,” POTUS concluded. The remarks came shortly after Trump took to Twitter to applaud a Syrian ceasefire, stressing that “millions of lives will be saved” as a result. Great news out of Turkey. News Conference shortly with @VP and @SecPompeo. Thank you to @RTErdogan. Millions of lives will be saved! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019 This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some “tough” love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019 In another tweet, he claimed that the ceasefire deal “could never have been made 3 days ago” and that “there needed to be some ‘tough’ love in order to get it done”. Damascus, Kurds at Odds Over Ceasefire Deal While senior Kurdish official Aldar Khalil welcomed the ceasefire deal, the Syrian President's political adviser Bouthaina Shaaban, for her part, stated that “the ceasefire agreement announced by the US and Turkey is unclear”. “As for the term 'security zone’, it is incorrect: what Turkey really implies is a zone of occupation”, she added. The ceasefire was announced following four-hour talks in Ankara between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US Vice President Mike Pence, who said that the ceasefire will last 120 hours to allow the withdrawal of YPG forces from the area to a distance of about 30 kilometres (about 20 miles) from the border with Turkey. Ankara's Military Operation in Syria On 9 October, Turkey kicked off its Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria after Trump withdrew support for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and related Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in the region referred to by its de facto rulers as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria and often referred to as Rojava by the Kurds. Turkey views the YPG as a terrorist organisation, related to the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). According to Ankara, the offensive is aimed at clearing the border area of \"terrorists\" and creating a security zone for about 3 million Syrian refugees currently residing in Turkey. Damascus condemned the operation by describing it as an act of aggression that undermines Syria's territorial integrity. Turkey also faced strong international criticism for its decision to start an offensive in Syria, with several nations either imposing sanctions or suspending arms deliveries to Ankara. *Daesh (ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State), a terrorist group banned in Russia and a number of other countries",

    "description": "American alligator catcher and reality television personality Paul Bedard posted a series of photos on Instagram featuring a 9-foot (3-metre-long) gator after catching it in a Florida family's pool.",
    "articleText": "Professional alligator wrangler Paul Bedard was called to a home in Parkland, Florida, where he found one of the state's native lizards lounging in a swimming pool. “He was mellow when I caught him. I named him ‘Cool Hand Luke’ because the gator was so mellow and so cool,” Bedard said, as quoted by the Fox News. “He didn’t try to get away from me, he didn’t try to come after me, he was just really cool. He’s got a real mellow personality.” Paul Bedard said that he had to “play” with the alligator in the water until it got tired, then he took the reptile out from the pool. Посмотреть эту публикацию в Instagram Got an e-gator call this morning about an 8 to 9 foot alligator in a swimming pool up in Parkland. The gator had walked through the screen and into the pool. I haven't had a good-sized gator in a swimming pool in probably a year, so I was kind of looking forward to this when I got the call. These are actually fun because the gator can't go anywhere and the water's almost always crystal clear. So all I have to do is jump in the water play around with him until he's tired and I can either hold his mouth shut and put a snare on it and tape it, or if he super energetic I can get him tired enough where I can just pick him up without the tape and carry him out in the yard and then tape him up once I get there. This guy was super mellow didn't really give me a hard time at all, I couldn't get him to spin on me he really wanted nothing to do with me. I simply made a frontal catch put a snare on his mouth and taped him up. Then finally got him to expend some energy.... I didn't want to pull him out of the water until he was tired, because he'll usually go into a death roll and smash himself up on the concrete or, if he's not taped, bite the concrete or something so it's always better to make him expend that energy in the water where is not going to get banged up. He ended up being 8 feet 8 in, and didn't really give me a hassle at all, it was basically as smooth and easy as it ever gets. Thank you Lord, much appreciated. #gatorboysalligatorrescue #gatorboys #rescue #animal #alligator #gators #gator #paulbedard #evergladesholidaypark #everglades #crocodile #croc #greatful #nuisancealligator Публикация от Paul Bedard (@gatorboysalligatorrescue) 15 Окт 2019 в 6:14 PDT The alligator will be used for educational purposes, according to Bedard.",

    "description": "Two major Asian giants, India and China, continue to seek ways to settle economic, political, territorial and trade differences. Indian and Chinese journalists have explained why the two countries need to act in synergy while commenting on the recent informal summit between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping in Chennai.",
    "articleText": "On 11-12 October, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a second informal meeting in Mamallapuram, a coastal town near Chennai, India. The first informal meeting took place in Central China's Wuhan in April 2018 following the India-China 73-day border standoff at Doklam. Likewise this year's informal talks were preceded by a diplomatic row between India, Pakistan and China over New Delhi's decision to reconstitute the India-administered part of Kashmir into two union territories. The new law which is due to come into effect on 31 October has escalated tensions since the three countries lay claims for the region. To add to the controversy, New Delhi and Beijing have yet to reach common ground on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which would pass through the Pakistani-administered Kashmir areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, claimed by India. Meanwhile, the 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) summit in August exposed India-China differences on vital economic issues and turned the spotlight on New Delhi's $53.6 billion-trade deficit with China in about $95.54 total bilateral trade. Indian businessmen also complained that China did not provide free market access to its IT and pharma products. And still, the second informal Xi-Modi summit has yet again demonstrated that the two Asian giants are open to dialogue and eager to talk the burning issues through, say Amrita Dhillon, the founding editor of a New Delhi-based magazine, The Kootneeti, and Thomas W. Pauken, a Beijing-based author and journalist who writes for China's CCTV broadcaster under the alias Tom McGregor. Informal Dialogue is the Best Way to Settle Differences According to Dhillon, \"informal dialogues\" are the best way to resolve controversies between the two nuclear neighbours. \"Relations between India and China are centuries-old\", the Indian journalist says. \"However, in the last seven decades, there have been many such occasions, where these two Asian giants came for a face-off: sometimes, on the battleground, sometimes at UNGA and sometimes through indirect channels. Xi and Modi represents 2.72 Billion people of this planet, who were once colonised and still struggling to develop. Such situations demand all the means of communication. Informal meetings like 'Wuhan Spirit' and 'Chennai Connect' shall help to build a good personal bond between the two leaders who are destined to hold the office at least till 2023-2024 together in China and India respectively.\" During the second informal summit Prime Minister Modi emphasised that while the 'Wuhan spirit' \"[had] instilled a new momentum and trust\" between the two nations, the October meeting was \"the start of a new era in India-China relations.\" The hand-woven silk portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping gifted by PM Narendra Modi, was created by weavers of Sri Ramalinga Sowdambigai Handloom Weavers Co-operative Society in Sirumugaipudur in Coimbatore District. #TamilNadu pic.twitter.com/8E3VRPiUsO — ANI (@ANI) 12 октября 2019 г. Commenting on Modi's statement Thomas Pauken outlined that there are signs showing that the recent meeting has indeed ushered in a “new era” for Sino-Indian ties. President Xi Jinping and I saw the marvellous Pancha Rathas. The five Rathas are examples of monolith rock-cut architecture. The Rathas in this monument include the Dharmaraja Ratha, Bhima Ratha, Arjuna Ratha, Nakula Sahadeva Ratha and Draupadi Ratha. pic.twitter.com/s5xQARmQfC — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 11 октября 2019 г. \"The ‘Art of the Ceremony’ holds great significance for China’s foreign policy\", the Beijing-based journalist notes, \"The imagery and photos coming from Xi’s visit to India appear fantastic. Xi and Modi are visiting India’s historic sites at or near Chennai and that proves China’s new passion for ancient Indian culture and their greater appreciation for the Hindu religion. Although Xi is not a religious man, we should never underestimate the special significance of the Chinese President going to spiritual grounds in India.\" Overlooking the Bay of Bengal is the majestic Shore Temple. One of the most iconic landmarks, the Shore Temple exemplifies the greatness and grandness of Indian culture. Here are some pictures... pic.twitter.com/ICDEWsZI30 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 11 октября 2019 г. India-China Trade Deficit & Sino-American Trade War As Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told reporters on 13 October, Modi and Xi agreed to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism between the countries. The new mechanism is aimed at reducing the Sino-Indian trade deficit as well as enhancing mutual trade, investment and services. Amrita Dhillon expresses cautious optimism with regard to the newly proposed measure advocating a \"wait-and-see approach.\" \"We will have to see how the two parties address particular trade concerns and what specific give-and-takes would be involved,\" she says. \"I fear an Indian entry to Chinese market won’t come free - maybe Indian green signal to Huawei building our 5G networks will be on the table here.\" She notes that while Chinese exports to India constitute 2.9 percent of its total export (2017), India still imports 16 percent of all imports from China. \"That is the huge gap that needs addressing-perhaps with import diversification,\" the Indian journalist explains. \"Although increased exports to China certainly provide a boost to the economy, but also provide the Chinese a big leverage over India to use it under its coercive means to launch export controls, inflicting economic damage to India-like it has been doing with Australia.\" Discussions continued with President Xi Jinping at Mamallapuram. We’ve been having productive deliberations on further improving India-China relations. pic.twitter.com/EncWliO1mG — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 12 октября 2019 г. As for China, it can \"benefit by scoring a free trade agreement with Delhi while at the same time negotiating a US-China trade deal\", Pauken, the author of US vs China: From Trade War to Reciprocal Deal, highlights. The Beijing-based journalist draws attention to the timing of Xi-Modi meeting: it took place \"right at the moment US and Chinese officials were meeting for trade talks in Washington.\" According to him, during the recent trade negotiations Beijing and Washington took a step closer to the signing of a partial trade deal that could potentially bring an end to the trade war simmering between the countries since March 2018. He does not rule out that the US, India and China may form a new \"triumvirate\" that would dominate the global economy for the rest of the 21st Century. © AP Photo / Mukhtar Khan Indian paramilitary soldiers patrol near the site of a gunbattle in Bijbehara, south of Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019 Why Kashmir Issue Remained Outside the Scope While the two countries addressed a wide range of topics during the high-level informal meeting the pressing Kashmir issue remained outside of the scope of the Xi-Modi summit. The question then arises as to why the Chinese and Indian leaders overlooked the problem. \"I believe, Kashmir is a very sensitive issue in South Asia and talking about it would've created a gap for other talks between leaders,\" Dhillon responds, adding that nevertheless, \"India needs to raise this issue through the highest diplomatic channels\" and draw China's attention to the Panchsheel Agreement in which the countries decided to not interfere in each other’s' domestic affairs. Pauken echoes Dhillon's stance: According to him, it was nearly impossible to solve this highly sensitive issue within the framework of informal summit. \"Xi and Modi are having informal meetings and on account of that if there are major issues that can’t be resolved anytime soon, there’s no reason to discuss them. Xi and Modi seek to establish a better friendship and they can always agree to disagree,\" the author underscores. On 6 August, India's parliament approved the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir into a union territory (UT) and formed a separate UT in Ladakh. Beijing opposed India's move to make Ladakh a union territory, since both countries have a territorial dispute over the region. Responding to China's concerns Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar explained in an interview with the Asia Society Policy Institute that India's frontier had not changed and the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between China and India had remained intact. India and China Have Great Potential, Should Act in Synergy No matter how big the differences between India and China are, the two countries have great economic potential and need to develop ties and act in synergy, the journalists say. \"India and China are comparatively younger than the rest of the world,\" Dhillon points out explaining that in India more than 65 percent of the population are below the age of 25, while China has around 65 percent of the population between the age of 16 and 59 years. Having \"supreme human capital\" and \"taping on the human resource\" the two countries \"will generate more prosperity for the world,\" she foresees. Besides, India and China could be complementary to each other, the Indian journalist stresses: while India is doing very well in space technology, China is leading the world in artificial intelligence (AI). \"In the second half of this very Asian Century India and China are going to be the largest economies as well as markets,\" Dhillon says. \"The time is ripe for both the countries to side the irritants while talking on the bilateral relations, and forge 21st century ties.\" Pauken shares the similar stance by envisioning that the cooperation of the two countries may pave the way to a \"new paradigm in geopolitics.\" \"We can expect the dawn of brighter ties between China and India as the neighbouring nations start to overcome gaps or cultural misunderstandings and they will both strive to work in greater harmony to endeavour in more economic cooperation,\" the Beijing-based author concludes.

    "description": "Earlier this month, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruled that Washington could introduce tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods in retaliation for what the WTO has ruled its illegal subsidies to aerospace firm Airbus, which caused \"adverse effects\" on US rival Boeing.",
    "articleText": "The United States imposed tariffs on a record $7.5-billion in in European goods on Friday, targeting such products as Italian cheese and French wine, AFP reported. The European Union has repeatedly warned Washington of reciprocal measures if it proceeds with tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods, from aircraft to agricultural goods to French wine and Italian cheese. The US Trade Representative’s office announced that it will impose new tariffs of $7.5 billion on European goods after the World Trade Organisation found that the EU had provided billions of dollars’ worth of illegal subsidies to Airbus, the European plane maker and US-based Boeing's rival, and concluded that Washington can impose tariffs in retaliation, putting an end to the trade dispute which began in 2004. EU officials, for their part, argued that Boeing has benefited from similar subsidies. The WTO ruling, however, does not restrict the US tariffs from targeting industries beyond aviation. In April, Washington released a document that listed six pages of European products to be covered by the new tariffs. Following the ruling, the US decided on a tax hike of 10 percent on European aircraft and 25 percent on agricultural products. The move has drawn both condemnation and criticism from EU dairy, spirits and produce exporters, which said they were being unfairly dragged into a trade war. The trade dispute between the US and its transatlantic allies began last year, with Washington slapping duties on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, and Brussels responding by hitting over $3 billion in US goods, from bourbon and corn to Harley-Davidson motorcycles, with a steep 25 percent tariff.",

    "description": "As senators fought Thursday over the political situation in northern Syria and sanctions against Turkey, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer tried to reverse Trump’s decision and return US forces.",
    "articleText": "Schumer tried to force a symbolic rebuke of Trump, saying it would send a signal that might make the president reverse his decision and send US troops back in. His motion, however, was blocked by Sen. Rand Paul who said not only has Congress never authorized going to war in Syria, but sending troops back would mean putting them in between Turkey and the Kurds, both US allies but who are now battling each other. Paul suggested halting US arms sales to Turkey, which he said would be a serious blow rather than a symbolic rebuke, yet Sen. James Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, blocked it, telling both sides to cool down and wait for “comprehensive legislation.” A bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Chris Van Hollen, put together a Turkey sanctions bill later on Thursday, proposing “wide-ranging mandatory sanctions” against Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) over its purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defence systems. According to Graham, the new sanctions would affect \"top Turkish officials\" beyond those already targeted by the White House, including restricting visa access to the US, as well as \"asking [for] a deep dive into Erdogan's personal finances,\" along with sanctions targeting the Turkish armed forces and Turkey's state-owned Halk Bank.",

Schumer, who attended the event as well, showed solidarity with the general, tweeting, \"While Donald Trump was having another rally, it was great to catch up with General Mattis—the Meryl Streep of generals.\" While President @realDonaldTrump was having another rally, it was great to catch up with General Mattis—the Meryl Streep of Generals. pic.twitter.com/UHxCObLu0q — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 18, 2019 Both Mattis and Schumer made reference to Trump’s infamous tweet where he called Streep “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood” in a tweet after his election, as the actress Streep had criticized Trump in a speech at the Golden Globes.

    "title": "White House Faces Criticism Over Picking Trump's Doral Resort to Host G-7 Summit Next Year",
    "description": "The United States will host the 2020 Group of Seven (G-7) summit at Trump National Doral, a resort property near Miami owned by President Trump's family.",
    "articleText": "The summit will take place June 10-12, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters Thursday at the White House. \"We thought of the 12 places that we looked at... this was by far and away the best choice,\" Mulvaney said, adding that the list was eventually narrowed to two options in Utah, one in Hawaii and one in Florida. Trump was the one who suggested the Doral property be added to the list of sites under consideration, said Mulvaney, who cited the resort's proximity to airports, landing zones and hospitals. Trump first suggested in the closing days of this year's G-7 summit in France that his Doral resort was the front-runner to host next year's gathering of world leaders. \"I think it’s just a great place to be. I think having it in Miami is fantastic. Really fantastic,\" he said at the time. \"Having it at that particular place, because of the way it’s set up, each country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow. And the bungalows, when I say, they have a lot of units in them. So I think it just works out well.\" The decision is certain to spark challenges from Democrats and ethics watchdog groups who will argue that the president is seeking to enrich his family's brand by bringing world leaders to a Trump property. Critics argued earlier during the Biarritz summit that the selection would be a clear violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, prohibiting presidents from accepting payments from foreign countries, US states or the federal government. Mulvaney rejected those arguments on Thursday, insisting that Trump would not profit from the gathering as the facility had agreed to host the G-7 at cost, making the summit “dramatically cheaper.” \"I get the criticisms. So does [Trump]… but no, there’s no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form,\" Mulvaney said. \"If you think it's going to help his brand, that's great, but I would suggest that he doesn't need much help promoting his brand.\" A Democratic aide with the House Appropriations Committee noted after the announcement that the House passed two bills this year with provisions that would prevent the president from spending federal funds at his family properties. However, the Senate has not approved the measures so far. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a left-leaning watchdog group, also said in a statement Thursday afternoon that there is \"no question that the American government is being used as a public relations and marketing subsidiary of the Trump Organization.\" The summit itself and its eventual schedule are likely to draw significant interest in the coming months, as the agenda is yet to be shaped by world leaders. However, Mulvaney announced at Thursday's briefing that “climate change will not be on the agenda.\" The topic has been a recurring theme at recent G-7 gatherings, though Trump has been absent from climate related sessions in each of the past two years.",

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The European Council condemned Turkey's military operation in northern Syria, noted the Turkish-US deal to suspend the offensive and called for ending military action in the area.",
    "articleText": "\"The EU condemns Turkeyʼs unilateral military action in North-East Syria which causes unacceptable human suffering, undermines the fight against Daʼesh and threatens heavily European security. The European Council notes tonightʼs US-Turkey announcement on a pause for all military operations. It again urges Turkey to end its military action, to withdraw its forces and to respect international humanitarian law,\" the Council said in conclusions on the results of the first day of the EU leaders summit in Brussels late on Thursday. The European Council recalled that the EU member states had decided to end arms export licensing to Turkey amid its Operation Peace Spring. \"The European Union remains engaged in its efforts towards effectively addressing the serious humanitarian and refugee crisis in light of evolving needs, including by supporting those Member States that are facing the most serious challenges in terms of migratory flows in the Eastern Mediterranean,\" the document added. On October 9, Turkey launched cross-border security Operation Peace Spring against Kurdish-led militia, which Ankara sees as terrorists, and the Daesh* terror group. On Thursday, US Vice President Mike Pence said the United States and Turkey had reached an agreement to implement a 120-hour ceasefire in northeast Syria to allow the withdrawal of the Kurdish People's Protection Units' (YPG) forces. The European Council also supported a plan to introduce sanctions against Turkey for its drilling in Cyprus' Exclusive Economic Zone. \"The European Council also endorses the Council conclusions of 14 October 2019 on Turkeyʼs illegal drilling activities in Cyprusʼ Exclusive Economic Zone and reaffirms its solidarity with Cyprus,\" the council said in conclusions on the results of the first day of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels late on Thursday. The document referred to the decision made by the Council of the European Union on Monday to introduce a framework regime of restrictive measures against those involved in Turkey's drilling for hydrocarbons off Cyprus' coast.

    "description": "Hillary Clinton might soon join the 2020 race for the White House and take advantage of the weak and fractured field of Democratic hopefuls, Ben Shapiro said on Thursday.",
    "articleText": "During \"The Ben Shapiro Show,\" Shapiro said voters aren't responding to the current Democratic candidates’ initial policy proposals, creating tension as “people are not satisfied with the field they have.” \"Honestly, if Hillary Clinton were to make her grand reentrance, now would be about the time she should do it. Because the fact is, a lot of people are dissatisfied with [Joe] Biden. A lot of people are dissatisfied with [Elizabeth] Warren and Hillary is an enormous name.\" Shapiro predicted that if Clinton got into the race she would easily clinch the nomination, but said she is unlikely to do so, paving the way for a Trump victory next November. \"If she were to jump in right now, I think there's a pretty good shot she wins the nomination,\" he said. \"Now, is she actually going to do that? Probably not. And that means the Democratic field is pretty, extraordinarily weak.\" The Daily Wire editor-in-chief also targeted Warren directly and slammed her as a liar, referring to the controversy over her past claims of Native American ancestry. \"The budding impression of Elizabeth Warren is that she's dishonest,\" he said. \"She lies about everything... she lies about her 'Medicare-for-all' plan... and she has now gone back and deleted her tweet about Native American DNA... she's a damn liar.\" Last Wednesday Clinton mentioned a hypothetical 2020 run during a PBS News Hour interview and said she could defeat Trump \"again\" if she decided to jump back in. \"So maybe there does need to be a rematch,\" Clinton said. \"Obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\"",

    "description": "China emphasized Thursday that the US must remove tariffs in order for the two countries to reach a final agreement on trade, Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said.",
    "articleText": "Gao told reporters at a weekly press conference that China’s position and goal for the China-US trade negotiations has never changed, according to CNBC. “Both sides’ ultimate goal for the negotiations is to end the trade war, cancel all additional tariffs,” he said. “This is good for China, good for the US and good for the world.” The latest round of trade talks between the world’s two largest economies ended late last week in Washington, with the US saying after the meeting that it would suspend a tariff increase on Chinese goods that was supposed to take effect on Tuesday this week. US President Donald Trump said China agreed to a “very substantial phase one deal” that will be written over the next three weeks, adding that the deal would address intellectual property and financial services concerns, with China also expected to purchase $40 billion to $50 billion in US agricultural products – an amount yet to be confirmed by Beijing. The Ministry of Commerce spokesman said on Thursday that Chinese companies would increase their purchases of US agricultural products according to Chinese market needs and market-based principles. Gao also did not confirm when a phase one agreement would be signed or whether the leaders of both countries planned to meet, yet said that teams from both sides remain in communication. “We hope both sides can continue to work together to advance the negotiations and, as soon as possible, reach a phased agreement and make new progress on canceling tariffs,” Gao said.",

    "description": "Mexican security forces have arrested one of the sons of notorious drug kingpin Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, local officials say.",
    "articleText": "Ovidio Guzmán Lopez was reportedly arrested in the western city of Culiacán, the stronghold of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel. His capture had triggered heavy gun battles between suspected cartel members and the security forces across the city, the BBC reported. The statement from the local police, however, was doubted by Mexican security secretary Alfonso Durazo who said 30 members of the National Guard and army were patrolling in Culiacan when they were fired on from a house. They repelled the attack and inside the house found Ovidio Guzman Lopez. Durazo said the house was then surrounded by heavily armed gunmen who had \"a greater force\" and authorities decided to suspend the operation. He did not say if Ovidio Guzman was arrested or went free after being located. Later, Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo told Reuters that the security forces released the drug lord's son from a house where they apprehended him. The decision was made to protect lives, the minister said. Ovidio Guzmán, said to be in his 20s, is believed to have played a key role in the Sinaloa cartel following the arrest of his father, Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, who was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years in the US back in July. Lopez is wanted in the US on several drug-related charges, Mexican media report. The Sinaloa state government said it was \"working to restore calm and order in the face of the high-impact incidents that have occurred in recent hours in various points around Culiacán\", AFP news agency reports. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he would make a statement later on Thursday. El Chapo (or \"Shorty\") ran the Sinaloa cartel across northern Mexico, becoming one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US. In 2009, Guzmán entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn. He was accused of having helped export hundreds of tonnes of cocaine into the US and of conspiring to manufacture and distribute heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana. He is also known for his escape attempts, breaking from Mexican jail through a tunnel in 2015. He was later arrested and extradited to the United States in 2017.",

Earlier on Thursday, Mulvaney said the temporary hold on Ukraine security assistance was related to a demand for an investigation into Democrats tied to the 2016 US election scandal surrounding a server with the DNC. \"Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,\" Mulvaney said during the briefing. \"But that's it. That's why we held up the money.\" Mulvaney was asked to clarify if statement and he said it was \"absolutely appropriate\" to withhold the security assistance to Ukraine because of concerns of corruption there.",

    "articleText": "On Thursday, the government approved imposing a $6 monthly tax on online calls via mobile applications in a bid to raise additional funds for its debt-ridden budget. Moreover, the authorities introduced a new tax on tobacco and announced plans to increase the value-added tax (VAT) to 15 percent by 2020. The measures sparked mass protests in Beirut and other cities. According to media reports, protesters blocked off the Beirut-Damascus international highway. Footage released by Lebanese TV channels showed the demonstrators burning tires and calling for a \"government resignation and revolution.\" \"At the request of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a decision was made to cancel a 20 cent [daily] tax on calls made via WhatsApp. This issue will not be discussed by the cabinet any further and all the services will remain available as before,\" Choucair told the LBCI broadcaster. There have been no official comments on other taxes. Lebanon has recently been rocked by anti-government protests amid a severe deterioration of the economic situation in the country. On Sunday, during a rally in central Beirut, demonstrators called for the resignation of the government, holding economic reforms and taking action to cope with corruption.

    "articleText": "\"They both pleaded not guilty,\" the US Attorney's Office said on Thursday. Correia and Kukushkin were charged earlier in the week and are set to make their next appearance in court on December 2 at 2:00 p.m. [6:00 p.m. GMT], the US Attorney's Office added. Last week, US federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Correia and Kukushkin as well as two other businessman - Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman - for funnelling $1 million in illegal donations from foreign nationals to unspecified political campaigns. Parnas and Fruman made their initial appearance at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on October 10. Later that day, the two men were released on a $1 million bond each. In one of several schemes they are accused of carrying out, the four men allegedly conspired to make political donations to US candidates funded by a foreign national, who the indictment identified as \"a Russian citizen and businessman who, at all relevant times, was not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.\" In another plot, the four men are accused to have donated money to a member of Congress and then tried to press the lawmaker to \"remove or recall the then-US ambassador to Ukraine.\" That effort, the indictment alleged, was carried out \"at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\" Bill Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office, said last week that co-defendant Kukushkin was arrested in San Francisco shortly after Parnas and Fruman were apprehended in Virginia, while Correia remains at large. Sweeney emphasized that the investigation is ongoing and is focused on uncovering genuine corruption. The indictment did not mention Giuliani by name, but the lawyer in a May 18 Twitter post identified both Parnas and Fruman as his clients. Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives have sought to depose both Parnas and Fruman as part of their ongoing impeachment investigation into Trump.",

    "description": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Thursday that the country had finally reached a “great new deal” that would “#GetBrexitDone” and allow the UK Parliament to focus on other important issues, such as the National Health Service. However, some believe the referendum leaves Northern Ireland out to dry.",
    "articleText": "In hopes of meeting the October 31 Brexit deadline and avoiding a request for another extension, Johnson’s government and the European Union met Thursday and were able to reach an agreement that both sides are optimistically touting as the final withdrawal deal. We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019 Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and other members of the EU echoed Johnson’s positive outlook on the deal. Juncker referred to the agreement as a “fair compromise between the EU and the UK” in a statement, adding that “it is [a] testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens.” “We didn’t negotiate an agreement with the idea it would be rejected by the British Parliament,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a Thursday press conference following the European Council meeting, adding that they “haven’t focused on what will happen if the British Parliament doesn’t accept the withdrawal agreement.” However, she attempted to reassure the public that the Brexit saga may be coming to an end by revealing that Johnson vowed “to do everything to find the majority” for the deal in the House of Commons. One of the major points of the new deal regards the removal of the Northern Irish backstop and revisions that would keep the country in the UK customs territory, but also allow it to remain in the European single market. The anti-democratic backstop has been abolished. The people of Northern Ireland will be in charge of the laws that they live by, and – unlike the backstop – will have the right to end the special arrangement if they so choose. #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019 “I have mixed feelings today,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Thursday, according to the Washington Post. “It’s a little bit like an old friend that’s going on a journey or an adventure without us, and we really hope it works out for them. But I think there will always be a place at the table for the United Kingdom if they were ever to choose to come back.” Alexander Mercouris, editor-in-chief of The Duran, joined Radio Sputnik’s Loud and Clear on Thursday to speak on Johnson and other Conservatives’ change-of-heart when it comes to Northern Ireland. https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/eu-and-pm-johnson-reach-brexit-agreement “It’s been remarkable to see how over the last couple of days there’s been a string of articles in Conservative-backing newspapers like the Daily Telegraph in which they’re basically saying that Britain holding onto Northern Ireland is becoming … a liability, because it is holding Britain or, to be precise, England, into the EU in a way that it really doesn’t want to be,” Mercouris told hosts Brian Becker and John Kiriakou. “For the first time since 1922, it is beginning increasingly to look as if Conservative opinion is starting to harden against the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland,” he said, referencing the 1922 establishment of the Irish Free State. Mercouris said that the major takeaway from the current proposal is that “already it is treating Northern Ireland in a different way from the rest of the United Kingdom and is putting it in much closer association with the Irish Republic.” “Having visited Northern Ireland as recently as March, I have to say … my overwhelming feeling when I was there is Irish unification now is only a matter of time,” he added. The UK Parliament will vote on Johnson’s Brexit referendum on Saturday if it is presented as expected. According to the EU’s Benn Act, the prime minister’s failure to muster a majority will result in yet another extension of the Brexit deadline.

    "description": "Thousands of teachers marched through Chicago Thursday following a rally outside of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) headquarters, marking the first day of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) strike.",
    "articleText": "The issues teachers are marching over extend past teacher pay to how poor and working families in Chicago have been disproportionately affected by education divestment, CTU member and activist Nick Stender discussed on Radio Sputnik’s By Any Means Necessary Thursday. https://www.spreaker.com/user/radiosputnik/the-chicago-teachers-strike-marches-on “The issues are not just teacher pay, which is always an issue. Teachers, given the kind of work that we do, are some of the most underpaid members of society. We are very underpaid - pay is an issue of course. We are also talking mainly about staffing. Our schools are horrendously understaffed. In fact, almost all the schools in CPS do not have a nurse. A nurse comes to my school once a week just to basically poke her head in, say she was there and go to the next place. We don’t have a librarian in my school. We don’t have art teachers, we don’t have music teachers … We need more counselors in our schools as well, especially in the high-trauma neighborhoods like the school I work in,” Stender explained. — Monica Trevino (@MonicaETrevino) October 17, 2019 “Statistics show that in a high-trauma neighborhood, you need to have one counselor for every 50 students, and I would even argue that maybe that’s a little high, given some of the severity of the issues that our students deal with,” he said. “In CPS schools, there is one counselor for every 720 students - a major issue, and it makes it functionally impossible for our classes to function, because our students aren’t really able to learn in that capacity.\" “When we have overcrowded classrooms - some classes have one teacher for 40 students in kindergarten classes - you can see that the combination of both trauma, lack of attention to trauma and the class size issue is causing some really major holdups in the system. And so we are fighting to create the learning environment students need … that will actually allow learning to be done,” Stender added. — Tovarisch (@nwbtcw) October 17, 2019 Thursday’s strike, which involved about 25,000 CPS teachers, came after the CTU rejected a contract proposal put forth by the district Wednesday evening. “The support has been overwhelming,” Stender noted. “I’ve never seen this sort of community support for any action that [I’ve been at before]. On the picket lines earlier today, we had honking from almost every single car that came by, people coming up to us and expressing support for the teachers and support for our struggle, because the people in the community understand that teachers play a vital role in making sure that our society can continue being a society and not fall into anarchy. The issues may be different from 2012. We are still fighting to keep that clause about stopping charter school expansion, but the issues now are much more about staffing, about class sizes, which ironically is not something we can explicitly legally negotiate on,” Stender added. — Abby 🌹 (@abbyangriest) October 17, 2019 The last teacher strike in Chicago took place in 2012, when around 26,000 members of the CTU walked out of 580 schools to fight for improved pay, benefits and job security. According to Stender, the school district has the money to support the teachers’ current demands. However, that money isn’t being directed where it should be. “The money exists in the form of tax breaks for corporations, which they were going to give to Amazon to come to Chicago” and establish its headquarters there. “Thankfully, that did not happen,” he said. “The money goes to developments in the [Chicago] Loop, developments on the North Shore, these parks they built, including parks around Millennium Park. Listen, I'm not saying that these beautification projects aren’t important. I’m just saying that this is by design that we are seeing the very, very meager breadcrumbs being doled out to the teachers, because it’s really easy for anybody on the street to look at this and say, ‘Oh, yeah, just fund the schools,’” Stender continued. “We can see why the schools aren’t being funded in this way, because it is working class families being affected, it’s people without power, people who are marginalized, and the lack of funding in those areas contributes to that marginalization.” “All the teachers that I've spoken with have raised these exact same issues.” — Tovarisch (@nwbtcw) October 17, 2019 On Thursday, CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates confirmed that the strike will continue Friday. School officials also confirmed that Friday classes are canceled. “What is it that Karl Marx said in ‘The Communist Manifesto’? That everything that is sacred is made profane by capitalism … we’re seeing that in Chicago. Education used to be considered a sacred right for students,” Stender noted. However, that being said, there’s been a “tremendous growth” in “union power” over the last few years, Stender noted. “That’s extremely important to point out, and really the Chicago Teachers Union led the way in 2012, that first strike that really galvanized the teacher’s movement … us teachers are very conscious of that fact that this is not just a national issue but an international issue and that people are looking to Chicago to see what direction we are going to take,” Stender added.

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Facebook has taken down an RT page filled with Russian recipes and pictures of caviar canapes, the chief editor of the news channel’s Russia Beyond media project said Thursday.",
    "articleText": "\"Facebook has deleted our Russian Kitchen page with recipes of Russian cuisine and pictures of caviar, mayonnaise and stuff like that,\" Vsevolod Pulya said. The account had over 42,000 subscribers. The US-based network initially limited the number of Russian Kitchen \"Stories\" posts showed in the newsfeed, then blocked it for everyone but admins and eventually deleted it without a warning. Project managers have asked for an explanation from the social media giant. A Facebook message on the page where the profile was says the community might have broken its rules in spamming. Facebook has been clamping down on Russia-based accounts after promising the US Senate to be tougher on alleged propaganda. It deleted hundreds of accounts this year that originated from Russia.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces record-low approval ratings ahead of next week’s national elections, a Gallup poll revealed on Thursday.",
    "articleText": "\"Support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fallen sharply since 2016, his first full year in office, when nearly three in four (72 percent) said they approved,\" a press release summarizing the poll said. \"In 2019, for the first time, Canadians are more likely to say they disapprove (52 percent) than to say they approve (46 percent) of Trudeau's job performance.\" Trudeau faces blowback from a carbon tax imposed on provinces that fail to meet emission reduction targets as well as voter fears of declining living standards, the release said. \"The prime minister's carbon tax program has been bogged down by political infighting and concerns that heavily coal-dependent provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan will suffer too much economically,\" the release said. In addition, pocketbook issues have gained ground in the past two years, with the proportion of adults saying their standard of living is improving falling 10 percentage points to 52 percent, according to the poll. A separate poll by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation predicts the election will result in a minority government, with support for the two largest parties, Conservatives and Liberals, below 33 percent.",

    "description": "BRUSSELS (Sputnik) - The European Union should suspend negotiations with Turkey on accession to the bloc and adopt economic sanctions in order to stop Ankara's military operation against Kurdish militia in Syria, EU Parliament President David Sassoli said on Thursday.",
    "articleText": "\"The Kurdish population of north-eastern Syria, which fought bravely against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State*, is now under attack by a NATO country. We emphatically and unreservedly condemn Turkey’s military action in north-eastern Syria. This constitutes a grave violation of international law, undermines the stability and security of the region as a whole, bringing further suffering to people already affected by war, as well as obstructing access to humanitarian assistance,\" Sassoli said at a European Council meeting in Brussels. According to Sassoli, the EU Parliament welcomes the decision to coordinate national embargoes on future sales of arms to Turkey, though, this must be just a first step before introducing economic sanctions against Ankara. \"It is our duty to send an unambiguous message by promoting a joint EU embargo not just on future arms shipments, but also on those already on their way ... We must do everything in our power to stop this act of aggression and launch an initiative that can be thrashed out within NATO and submitted to the UN Security Council ... Against this background, the European Parliament reiterates its call for the accession negotiations with Turkey to be suspended,\" he added. Turkey began the offensive, dubbed Operation Peace Spring, in northern Syria on October 9 with the aim of setting up a 20-mile buffer zone free of any Kurdish presence along its border with Syria. Damascus has called the operation an invasion and deployed its troops to the north of the country. *Daesh (ISIL/ISIS/Islamic State/IS), a terrorist group banned in Russia and a wide number of other countries.",

    "description": "The run up to the 2020 presidential election has already seen Donald Trump launch scathing attacks against his potential election opponents, accusing Joe Biden of corruption by using his former office to end a corruption investigation regarding his son's position on the board of Ukrainian energy company - Burisma Holdings.",
    "articleText": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign launched a scathing attack against Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday regarding a speech where the Facebook CEO defended his company's decision not to remove political adverts containing what is alleged to be false information. Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement that “Facebook has chosen to sell Americans’ personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans.” \"Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company’s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook’s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.” Democrats want to steal the Election #VoteTrump2020 #FactsMatter #WWG1WGA pic.twitter.com/lG2HMzGpxW — Arthur Worth (@arthworth) October 11, 2019 The comments from the Biden campaign follow a livestreamed speech made by Zuckerberg at Georgetown University where he made the case that it is not Facebook's responsibility to regulate political content and determine what should be considered false advertising. “Political ads can be an important part of voice, especially for local candidates and up and coming challengers that the media might not otherwise cover,” he said. “Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover.” Zuckerberg and Facebook received significant backlash after the speech, especially after President Trump’s reelection campaign published a $1 million ad targeting Biden directly, accusing the former vice president of abusing the office to pressure Ukrainian officials to stop a corruption investigation into his son Hunter Biden's financial behaviour. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is rapidly gaining on Biden as the frontunner of the race, has also criticised the company's decision, describing Facebook as a “disinformation-for-profit machine.” I'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech: https://t.co/o9X9v4noOm — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019 Facebook had an established policy of not running deceptive ads but changed it right before the ad was launched.

    "description": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Saudi oil giant Aramco has delayed its initial public offering after work at two of its major facilities was disrupted by September attacks, media reported Thursday.",
    "articleText": "The long-awaited launch has been pushed back by possibly a few weeks but not cancelled, the Financial Times cited three people familiar with the matter as saying. A source told the daily that the company wanted to make it clear to investors how last month’s attacks on an oil field and a processing plant had affected its quarterly revenue. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing its sources, that the launch of the share sale might be delayed until December or January. Aramco was expected to announce the initial public offering later in October. It was reportedly considering a listing of a 5 percent stake, which would have raised a record $100 billion. The oil facilities belonging to Saudi Aramco were attacked in mid-September which resulted in a temporary sharp decrease in the kingdom's oil output. The Yemeni rebel Houthi movement claimed the responsibility for the attack. Riyadh blamed the incident on Iran, which on its part denied allegations.",

    "description": "The race for the 2020 Democratic nomination has begun to siphon into 3 main contestants: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. The likelihood of defeating incumbent President Donald Trump will be an essential factor in the decision made by Democratic primary voters as to which candidate to support.",
    "articleText": "A new poll released on Wednesday shows President Trump holding a lead over Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in hypothetical match-ups. The survey conducted by Emerson College discovered that 51% percent of registered voters would vote for Trump over Biden and Warren, who would both receive 49%. The single leading Democrat in the race who could beat Trump in the Midwestern state according to this poll is Senator Bernie Sanders, who leads the President with 51%, while Trump would secure just 49 percent support - the exact reverse of the Biden and Warren match-ups. IOWA POLL: General Election Head to Heads:@BernieSanders 51% | Trump 49%@JoeBiden 49% | Trump 51%@ewarren 49% | Trump 51%https://t.co/CIjFwBESSE pic.twitter.com/wcqiqS9JeS — Emerson Polling (@EmersonPolling) October 17, 2019 This may turn out badly for Democrats, however, as the poll indicates that Warren and Biden are currently both tied in first place at 23% support among Democratic voters, leading the Democratic field. It also showed Mayor Pete Buttigieg in 3rd place with 16%, overtaking Bernie Sanders who is at 13%. The poll surveyed 888 registered voters between 13-16 October and contains a 3.2 percentage-point margin of error. A September poll from Emerson college illustrates a dramatic shift in preference among Democratic voters, who originally had Biden in the lead with 25% and Sanders trailing slightly at 24%. The consistency between the two polls, however, is that they both show Biden losing to Trump as well as a Sanders victory in the state. Elizabeth Warren has seen a dramatic increase in the polls in recent weeks, overtaking fellow progressive Bernie Sanders and even securing a position as the frontrunner in certain polls. The Iowa caucus is scheduled for 2 February 2020.",

    "articleText": "\"The cabinet has agreed a charge of 20 [US] cents for the first call a day made via voice over internet protocol,\" Jarrah said, adding the idea was floated by the communications minister. Lebanese TV channels reported that the controversial proposal still needed parliamentary approval. If passed, it will come into being in January. Calls via apps will cost $6 a month or $72 a year. The charges will be in place for clients of the nation’s two state-run mobile service providers and then extended to Wi-Fi users. The cabinet hopes to raise an additional $219 million for its debt-ridden budget. Lebanon has been running a deficit of 150 percent of its gross domestic product and has been looking for ways to slash spending.",

    "title": "Scientists Believe Earth-Like Planets Might Be Common Outside Solar System",
    "description": "After studying the remains of exoplanets that crashed into dead stars, scientists tend to believe that rocky planets similar to Earth and Mars are likely common outside of our solar system.",
    "articleText": "A study published on Thursday in Science magazine describes how by observing the rocky guts of exoplanets, which are worlds from different star systems, scientists revealed that there might be plenty of worlds like Earth in our galaxy. “It’s pretty cool because this is really the only way to measure the geochemistry of exoplanetary bodies directly,” said lead author Alexandra Doyle, a graduate student of geochemistry and astrochemistry at UCLA, in a phone call. Co-author Edward Young, a professor of geochemistry and cosmochemistry at UCLA, added that the study represents “the first time such an advanced way of looking at the geochemistry of these bodies has been used.” The study describes a way of deducing the geochemistry of such worlds with the help of white dwarfs - remains of stars that have blown up and collapsed into tiny, dense spheres about the size of Earth. The pyrotechnic deaths of these stars scramble the orbits of many objects in our solar system, such as asteroids and planets. Some of these worlds may end up hurtling toward the star’s posthumous white dwarf, which tears them apart over the course of about 100,000 to one million years. “Whenever a body comes really close to it, a white dwarf will completely shred it and that dust and debris will fall and accrete onto the star,” Doyle explained. “White dwarfs are really the only way that you can measure the rocks directly because we know that when we’re observing them, the elements that we’re seeing—iron, silicon, magnesium—are directly from the rock itself.” The team observed six of these “polluted” white dwarfs located between 200 and 665 light years from Earth. The researchers were particularly interested in quantifying the iron content of rocks smashed up by the white dwarfs, as the iron could be a key indicator of “oxygen fugacity,” which is a measurement of the past oxidation levels of a planetary body. “The more oxygen you have around when you make the rocks, the more iron ends up in the rocks, as opposed to in metal,” said Young. “That’s what we’re measuring in the white dwarfs—the amount of iron that was in the rock when it hit the white dwarf.” The particular challenge is to detect the oxygen in these Earth-like planets as scientists are still not sure why planets in our solar system seem to have been enriched with so much oxygen. The only thing that remains clear is that oxidation deeply influences whether a world will develop a magnetic field, plate tectonics, and other processes that are crucial to life here on Earth. “Oxygen fugacity is as important as pressure and temperature constraints for determining which minerals will be dominant in the interior of a planet,” said Doyle. ”So, this can have huge implications for parameters that are important for habitability.” The researchers discovered that the same chemical compounds found in Earth, Mars, and asteroids in our solar system—including iron—are also abundant in the objects that crashed into these six white dwarf systems, meaning that bodies that are similar to Earth and Mars appear to be common throughout the Milky Way. Doyle and her colleagues plan to keep observing polluted white dwarfs to build an even more robust model of the contents of exoplanets. “The prospect of doing the kind of chemistry on planets that we do inside this solar system outside the solar system, I wouldn’t have thought would be possible,” said Young. “But it is possible,” he continued. “We’re actually doing true geochemistry on rocks from several planetary systems. To me, that’s really exciting because now everything we’ve learned about the solar system has relevance beyond the solar system.”",
